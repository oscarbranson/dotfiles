abstract = {The calcite shells, or tests, of foraminifera provide a window into Earth history because they are archived in most marine sediments and contain useful geochemical proxies for paleoceanography. Previous observations of diurnal heterogeneity in proxies like Mg/Ca demonstrate a complex relationship between environmental conditions and test composition. The causes for this diurnal banding and the potential impact for proxy interpretation in systems other than Mg/Ca have yet to be determined. Recently, Mg and Na in shells of the planktic foraminifer species Orbulina universa have been observed to be high at the location of the primary organic sheet (POS), i.e. the organic template upon which the calcite test is formed. Here we use time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), a chemical and isotope mapping technique with a spatial resolution of 300 nm, to show that Na banding is a consistent feature in the tests of 45 individual cultured O. universa. This banding occurs in two distinct forms: (1) sharp Na bands associated with organic sheets that are embedded in the calcite test after chamber formation; and (2) regular, thicker, but lower-amplitude Na bands that are found throughout the test. We use the pattern of the first type of banding to indicate the extent and sequence of calcite growth during chamber formation. Specifically, we show that new chamber formation involves growth over the previous chamber in Orbulina bilobata, a morphotype of O. universa that develops a second partial spherical chamber attached to the primary sphere. This is consistent with a bilamellar model of foraminiferal growth. However, a SIMS mapping survey of the morphologically more complex Globigerina bulloides and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei suggests that the pattern of growth during chamber formation and the prevalence of different types of Na bands may be species-specific. The wide, repeating Na bands that occur throughout the test of O. universa generally occur in an inverse pattern with respect to Mg banding for the first few days of the foraminifer's life, but this pattern changes as the organism ages. We use the magnitude, timing, and coherency between Na and Mg bands to put constraints on various proposed mechanisms for banding, including antiport Mg 2+ -2Na + exchange and kinetic growth rate effects.},

abstract = {The boron isotopic compositions and boron concentrations of selected modern marine carbonates were analysed by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry with a 2?? reproducibility of standards and samples better than 0.7{\%}. It was found that the boron isotopic compositions of modern marine carbonates fall within a relatively narrow range (+22.1 ?? 3{\%}. relative to NBS SRM951 boric acid standard) for all samples (biogenic, nonbiogenic, warm water, cold water, aragonitic, or calcitic). This is about 17{\%}. lighter than seawater. This indicates that mineralogy, temperature, and vital effects are not primary controls on the observed isotopic composition. The narrow range in isotopic composition is in contrast to the wide range in boron concentrations of these samples (10.9-71.4 ppm). The boron isotopic compositions and boron concentrations in modern marine carbonates are consistent with preferential adsorption of the isotopically lighter B(OH) 4
1- aqueous species over the B(OH)3 species before incorporation into the carbonate site. Because there is a pH control on the availability of B(OH)1-
4, the result is a pH control on the boron abundance in the carbonates. Possible second-order biomineralogic controls on pH may account for boron concentrations in calcareous organisms that produce low pH microenvironments at the site of CaCO3 precipitation. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {The DD4 mRNA of the penaeid prawn Penaeus japonicus was shown previously to be expressed in the epidermis adjacent to the exoskeleton specifically during the post-moult period, when calcification of the exoskeleton took place. The encoded protein possessed a Ca2+-binding site, suggesting its involvement in the calcification of the exoskeleton. In the present study, an additional ORF (open reading frame) of 289 amino acids was identified at the 5' end of the previous ORF. The newly identified part of the encoded protein included a region of approx. 120 amino acids that was highly rich in glutamate residues, and contained one or more Ca2+-binding sites. In an immunohistochemical study, signals were detected within calcified regions in the endocuticular layer of the exoskeleton. Bacterially expressed partial segments of the protein induced CaCO3 crystallization in vitro. Finally, a reverse transcription-PCR study showed that the expression was limited to an early part of the post-moult period, preceding significant calcification of the exoskeleton. These observations argue for the possibility that the encoded protein, renamed crustocalcin (CCN), promotes formation of CaCO3 crystals in the exoskeleton by inducing nucleation.},

abstract = {Although Sr/Ca ratios in abiogenic calcite are strongly controlled by precipitation rates, such a kinetic effect has never been demonstrated in calcitic bivalve shells. Therefore, we report Sr/Ca ratios together with daily growth rates in the calcitic shells of four individuals of the bivalve Pecten maximus (age class I). Ratios of Sr/Ca were found to be variable among individuals that grew at the same location, illustrating that vital effects dominate over environmental controls. Although daily growth rate was correlated with shell Sr/Ca ratios, it explained only half of the Sr/Ca variations. However, daily shell surface area increment, an estimation of the total quantity of carbonate precipitated for a given time, explained 74{\{}percnt{\}} of the Sr/Ca variability in the shells of P. maximus. This proves, for the first time in a calcitic bivalve, that shell Sr/Ca partitioning is mainly controlled by kinetic effects. The Sr/Ca ratio should therefore be tested as a potential proxy of calcification rate in modern or fossil calcitic biocarbonates.},

abstract = {The outstanding problem in the lithium geochemical cycle is the lack of an isotopic mass balance in the ocean. The ??6Li compositions of fresh basalts (-4???), the hydrothermal fluids derived from them (average -9???), and seawater (significantly heavier at -32???) are well understood, but only very sparse river input data are available for Li mass balance calculations. In an attempt to rectify the situation we have measured the lithium concentrations and isotopic compositions of major world rivers draining representative geological terrains. This helps both to constrain the river endmember and to understand the behavior of lithium isotopes in the continental weathering environment. Fluvial isotopic compositions display a very large range, -6.0 to -32.2???. There is no definitive relationship between ??6Li and lithology but, in general, rivers draining marine evaporites are -20 to -22???, carbonates -26 to -32???, black shales -26???, shields -6.6 to -19???, and mixed siliceous terrains -6 to -28???. The flow-weighted mean concentration of the measured rivers is 215 nM at -23???. This updated riverine ??6Li value, responsible for {\~{}}30{\%} of the global riverine discharge, does not solve the isotopic imbalance if the measured Li concentrations and isotopic compositions are representative of all rivers. The presence of a yet unidentified sink with a higher fractionation factor (?? ??? 1.023) than determined for low temperature basalt alteration (?? = 1.019) is required for an isotopic steady-state of Li in the ocean. Authigenic clays are a possible candidate as clays are known to be enriched in both lithium and in the light isotope preferentially. Alternatively, the hydrothermal flux must be much less than half of that estimated by the 3He inventory and the oceanic budgets for 87Sr/86Sr and Mg. The relationship of ??6Li to the major ions and 87Sr/86Sr suggests that the important process affecting river dissolved lithium isotopic compositions are fractionation between solution and secondary minerals and thus the intensity of weathering.},

abstract = {For many decades researchers have attempted to clarify the factors controlling the precipitation of calcium carbonate polymorphs and the incorporation of Mg into calcite precipitating in natural systems. In this study a novel experimental approach delineates the role of instantaneous supersaturation and solution {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} ratio in calcium carbonate mineralogy and composition. The results of this study show that in solutions with different {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} ratios, the transition between the aragonite and the calcite + aragonite precipitation fields is controlled by a combination of the saturation state of the solution with respect to {\{}CaCO3{\}} and the {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} ratio in solution. The data show that for increasing solution {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} ratios, progressively higher supersaturation level is required for calcite {\{}precipitation.The{\}} predominance of aragonite at high solution {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} and low supersaturations is attributed to a relative decrease in calcite growth rates as a result of increasing incorporation of Mg2+ in the calcite lattice at higher solution {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} ratios. As suggested by abundant experimental work, increasing solution {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} decreases the growth rate of calcite while aragonite growth rates stay unaffected. Our experiments do demonstrate that despite decreased growth rate the percentage of {\{}MgCO3{\}} in calcite increases with increasing solution {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} ratio. As calcite growth rates decrease, aragonite growth rates stay constant and it becomes the dominant mineral phase in solutions with high {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} ratio and low {\{}supersaturations.These{\}} findings are relevant to present-day mineralogical distributions in carbonate systems and might be the key to elucidate the environmental conditions responsible for mineralogic changes through geologic time. The observed dependence of calcium carbonate mineralogy on solution composition and supersaturation suggests that carbonate mineralogy is controlled by kinetics of growth.},

abstract = {Core-top samples from different ocean basins have been analyzed to refine our current understanding of the sensitivity of benthic foraminiferal calcite magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) to bottom water temperatures (BWT). Benthic foraminifera collected from Hawaii, Little Bahama Bank, Sea of Okhotsk, Gulf of California, NE Atlantic, Ceara Rise, Sierra Leone Rise, the Ontong Java Plateau, and the Southern Ocean covering a temperature range of 0.8 to 18??C were used to revise the Cibicidoides Mg/Ca-temperature calibration. The Mg/Ca-BWT relationship of three common Cibicidoides species is described by an exponential equation: Mg/Ca = 0.867 ?? 0.049 exp (0.109 ?? 0.007 ?? BWT) (stated errors are 95{\%} CI). The temperature sensitivity is very similar to a previously published calibration. However, the revised calibration has a significantly different preexponential constant, resulting in different predicted absolute temperatures. We attribute this difference in the preexponential constant to an analytical issue of accuracy. Some genera, notably Uvigerina, show apparently lower temperature sensitivity than others, suggesting that the use of constant offsets to account for vital effects in Mg/Ca may not be appropriate. Downcore Mg/Ca reproducibility, as determined on replicate foraminiferal samples, is typically better than 0.1 mmol mol-1 (2 S.E.). Thus, considering the errors associated with the Cibicidoides calibration and the downcore reproducibility, BWT may be estimated to within ?? 1??C. Application of the revised core-top Mg/Ca-BWT data to Cenozoic foraminiferal Mg/Ca suggests that seawater Mg/Ca was not more than 35{\%} lower than today in the ice-free ocean at 50 Ma.

Exceptions to this pattern are found during blooms at high latitudes, accompanying spring blooms at midlatitudes, and perhaps in association with more episodic export pulses.

abstract = {Precipitation of calcium carbonate by phytoplankton in the photic oceanic layer is an important process regulating the carbon cycling and the exchange of CO2 at the ocean-atmosphere interface. Previous experiments have demonstrated that, under nutrient-sufficient conditions, dou- bling the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in seawater—a likely scenario for the end of the century— can significantly decrease both the rate of calcification by coccolithophorids and the ratio of inorganic to organic carbon production. The present work investigates the effects of high pCO2 on calcification by the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (Strain TW1) grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a situation that can also prevail in the ocean. Nitrogen limitation was achieved in NO3-limited contin- uous cultures renewed at the rate of 0.5 d–1 and exposed to a saturating light level. pCO2 was increased from 400 to 700 ppm and controlled by bubbling CO2-rich or CO2-free air into the cultures. The pCO2 shift has a rapid effect on cell physiology that occurs within 2 cell divisions subsequent to the perturbation. Net calcification rate (C) decreased by 25{\%} and, in contrast to previous studies with N-replete cultures, gross community production (GCP) and dark community respiration (DCR) also decreased. These results suggest that increasing pCO2 has no noticeable effect on the calcifica- tion/photosynthesis ratio (C/P) when cells of E. huxleyi are NO3-limited.},

Here we show that energy positions and resonance features in experimental and theoretical XANES spectra can be used to identify the dominant molecular host site.

Rapid climate changes challenge this process by imposing stronger selection and by distancing populations from environments to which they are adapted. The unprecedented rates of climate changes anticipated to occur in the future, coupled with land use changes that impede gene flow, can be expected to disrupt the interplay of adaptation and migration, likely affecting productivity and threatening the persistence of many species.},

Indeed, the oceans currently act as a major sink for anthropogenic carbon (1), partially moderating increases in at- mospheric CO2 at the expense of a more acidic ocean. One of the great challenges for the next century is understanding how this shift in seawater chemistry will affect marine systems. Serving as a vivid microcosm for the ocean as whole, coral reefs display the beauty, diversity, and complexity of the ocean, while also ex- hibiting the ocean's sensitivity to envi- ronmental perturbations. Built from a framework of CaCO3 skeletons, coral reefs are particularly sensitive to ocean acidification because acidified seawater tends to slow skeletal growth (2). Despite the threat posed by ocean acidification to reef health, the detailed mechanisms re- sponsible for this sensitivity are still poorly understood. In PNAS, Venn et al. (3) address a key component of this problem, providing a detailed view of the chemical- scale changes that link coral skeletal growth and ocean acidification. Seawater},

abstract = {Ostracods are microcrustaceans with calcitic carapaces (each consisting of two valves or shells) that grow by moulting and regeneration of sequentially larger valves up to nine times before reaching maturity. The Mg content of these valves is species-dependent and is a function of their growth stage and the temperature, salinity, Mg content and Mg/Ca ratio of their host water. Newly formed, partly calcified valves of the non-marine nektic ostracod Mytilocypris henricae have high Mg contents (100,000 ppm Mg in CaCO3 at individual shell weights of 2 ??g). This relative Mg content decreases as calcification proceeds, until shell weights exceed 120 ??g, whereupon the Mg content is constant and useful as an indicator of the ostracod's environment. Mg/Ca ratios in individual ostracod valves from several species of the genera Mytilocypris and Australocypris from culture experiments and a series of Australian lakes indicate that the valve's Mg content increases as a function of increasing temperature and salinity. Within the range 11-25??C and for waters containing 24-2325 ppm Mg, the molar Mg/Ca ratio in these ostracods' fully calcified valves increases by 0.0015 (or 370 ppm Mg in CaCO3) per 1??C and per change of 125 ppm Mg in solution. For most mainland Australian lakes, a change in water composition of 125 ppm Mg corresponds to a change of 3.5??? in salinity. For a given Mg content of a lake, the Mg/Ca ratio of the water may vary within the range of common lacustrine values without significantly affecting Mg uptake in the ostracod valves. These relationships can provide palaeosalinities and/or palaeotemperatures for ostracods recovered from continental sediments. For Mg partitioning, an increase in temperature and salinity produce increased Mg content in ostracods, whereas for 18O fractionation in biogenic calcite an increase in temperature produces a decrease in ??18O of the ostracod and an increase in salinity leads to an increase in ??18O of the ostracod. Thus a combination of ??18O and Mg measurements on non-marine ostracods should enable unique resolution of palaeotemperature and palaeosalinity variations. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {Redfield noted the similarity between the average nitrogen-to- phosphorus ratio in plankton (N:P 5 16 by atoms) and in deep oceanic waters (N:P 5 15; refs 1, 2). He argued that this was neither a coincidence, nor the result of the plankton adapting to the oceanic stoichiometry, but rather that phytoplankton adjust the N:P stoichiometry of the ocean to meet their requirements through nitrogen fixation, an idea supported by recent modelling studies3,4 . But what determines the N:P requirements of phyto- plankton? Here we use a stoichiometrically explicit model of phytoplankton physiology and resource competition to derive from first principles the optimal phytoplankton stoichiometry under diverse ecological scenarios. Competitive equilibrium favours greater allocation to P-poor resource-acquisition machinery and therefore a higher N:P ratio; exponential growth favours greater allocation to P-rich assembly machinery and therefore a lower N:P ratio. P-limited environments favour slightly less allocation to assembly than N-limited or light- limited environments. The model predicts that optimal N:P ratios will vary from 8.2 to 45.0, depending on the ecological conditions. Our results show that the canonical Redfield N:P ratio of 16 is not a universal biochemical optimum, but instead represents an average of species-specific N:P ratios.},

abstract = {Size dependent changes in element concentrations in planktic foraminifers have long been recognized to inﬂuence their reliability as an archive for climate change. Traditionally, these changes have been interpreted as changes in element partitioning during the ontogeny of the organism with faster growth rates in the earlier part of the development. These changes, in the light of new culture experiments, can also be interpreted as changes in growth rate throughout the entire life of the organism, with larger, faster-growing specimens discriminating less efﬁ- ciently against trace element incorporation into the calcite shell. Growth rates of foraminifera are inﬂuenced by the environment and hence change geographically and temporally at various scales, e.g. glacial-interglacial or rapid millennial events such as the Younger Dryas. These changes in growth rate can account for some changes in element to calcium ratio between glacial and interglacials, which were previously linked to changes in seawater element ratios. },

abstract = {Palaeoclimate information is often extracted from Rhynchonelliform brachiopod shell calcite, in particular the inner secondary layer, via the $\delta$18O composition, which is a proxy for seawater temperature. Compared to $\delta$18O, the potential for Mg/Ca ratio, as a brachiopod seawater temperature proxy, has been neglected. The use of Mg/Ca ratio as a temperature proxy assumes that, with increasing temperature, more Mg substitutes for Ca in the calcite lattice. Brachiopod shells, like all biominerals, are composites of organic and inorganic components. This raises the possibility that magnesium is hosted by the organic components. Alternatively, magnesium may be present as a separate mineral phase, rather than a true component of the calcite lattice, or incorporated into calcite in non-ideal or variable coordination. Here we use synchrotron X-ray absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) at the Mg K-edge to determine the local environment of magnesium in two species of brachiopod with low Mg-calcite shells, Terebratulina retusa and Notosaria nigricans and one species with a high Mg-calcite shell, Novocrania anomala. XANES at the Mg K-edge of a suite of Mg-bearing standards fingerprints the local environment of magnesium in the brachiopod shell powders as well as in situ analyses. In all cases, it is evident that magnesium is not hosted by organic components but is within the inorganic component of the shell. These data support the possibility of using brachiopod Mg/Ca ratios as a temperature proxy. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

Evidence for habitual zooplankton ingestion was not ob- tained, and P. porites appears to be largely autotrophic. Out of the daily photosynthetically fixed energy, 26{\%} is used for animal respiration and growth, 22{\%} for zoo- xanthellae respiration and growth, and {\textless} 1{\%} for colony reproduction as mature planulae; 45{\%} remains unac- counted for. Colony respiration, net photosynthesis, colony skeleton and tissue growth, zooplankton ingestion, repro- ductive effort and energy content of tissues were measured. Energy loss as continuous mucus secretion was not detected, but may occur by an alternative route via mucus tunics, which occur periodically in situ and in the labora- tory. The energy budget suggests that a considerable excess of photosynthetically fixed energy is produced on an ideal sunny day at 10 m depth. This surplus may be required for periodic rather than continuous energy demands, or may be essential to survive "less-than-ideal" days, when net photosynthetic input is reduced.},

abstract = {Stable sulphur isotopes and major ionic composition were analysed in precipitation and throughfall samples from a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris, L.) forest near the Cercs coal-fired power plant (Catalonia, NE Spain). The purpose of the study was to determine the main sources of sulphur deposition on this pine forest. Sulphur isotope measurements from the SO2 power plant stack emissions were used to identify the isotopic signature of this source. Net throughfall fluxes of sulphur (26.1 kg S ha1 yr-1) and nitrogen (16.3 kg N ha-1 yr-1) were higher-5-25 times higher for S and 5-15 times for N-at this site than in other forests in Catalonia. Sulphur isotope analysis confirmed that the net throughfall fluxes of sulphur were mostly due to the dry deposition of the SO2 power plant emissions onto the pine canopies. Two potential atmospheric end-members were distinguished: regional background rainwater ($\delta$34S=+7.2‰) and power plant emissions ($\delta$34S=-2.8‰). By applying a two-component sulphur isotope mixing model, we found that during periods of low power plant activity (≤10 emission h day-1), 62{\%} of the throughfall sulphate could be attributed to the power plant emissions. At higher activity periods (≥14 emission h day-1), this contribution rose to 73{\%}. Although power plant contribution to bulk deposition was lower in both cases (34{\%} and 45{\%}), the possible influence of sulphate coming with long-range transport events from the polluted areas in the Mediterranean basin ($\delta$34S≈0‰) was not discarded. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The CO2 concentration during growth did not affect either ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase activity or its Km for CO2.When high-CO2 cells were transferred to low CO2 conditions, CA activity increased without a lag period, and this increase was accompanied by an increase in the rate of photosynthetic 14CO2 fixation under 14CO2-limiting conditions. On the other hand, CA activity as well as the rate of photosynthetic 14CO2 fixation at low 14CO2 concentrations decreased when low-CO2 cells were transferred to high CO2 conditions.Diamox, an inhibitor of CA, at 0.1 mM did not affect photosynthesis of low-CO2 cells at high CO2 concentration (0.5{\%}). Diamox inhibited photosynthesis only under low CO2 concentrations, and the lower the CO2 concentration, the greater was the inhibition. Consequently, the CO2 concentration at which the rate of photosynthesis attained one-half its maximum rate (Km) greatly increased in the presence of this inhibitor.When CO2 concentration was higher than 1{\%}, the photosynthetic rate in low-CO2 cells decreased, while that in high-CO2 cells increased.Fractionation of the low-CO2 cells in non-aqueous medium by density showed that CA was fractionated in a manner similar to the distribution of chlorophyll and RuBP carboxylase.These observations indicate that CA enhances photosynthesis under CO2-limiting conditions, but inhibits it at CO2 concentrations higher than a certain level. The mechanism underlying the above regulatory functions of CA is discussed.},

Here we document the accompanying size changes in entire planktic foraminiferal assemblages for the past 70 My and their relationship to paleoenvironmental changes. After the size decrease at the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/P) boundary, high latitude assemblages remained consistently small. Size evolution in low latitudes can be divided into three major phases: the first is characterized by dwarfs (65-42 Ma), the second shows moderate size fluctuations (42-14 Ma), and in the third phase, planktic foraminifers have grown to the unprecedented sizes observed today.Our analyses of size variability with paleoproxy records indicate that periods of size increase coincided with phases of global cooling (Eocene and Neogene). These periods were characterized by enhanced latitudinal and vertical temperature gradients in the oceans and high diversity (polytaxy). In the Paleocene and during the Oligocene, the observed (minor) size changes of the largely low-diversity (oligotaxic) assemblages seem to correlate with productivity changes. However, polytaxy per se was not responsible for larger test sizes. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here, it is shown that there are at least three effectively isoenergetic models that are equally likely to describe the vaterite structure at room temperature. These distinct models, each consisting of multiple structures, can explain the disorder of vaterite in terms of different orientations of the carbonate anions, multiple stacking sequences of the carbonate layers, and possible chiral forms.

abstract = {In the North and Baltic seas Atlantic cod Gadus morhua stocks collapsed as part or one of the major factors inducing large-scale ecosystem regime shifts. Determining the relative contribution of overfishing and climate variability in causing these shifts has proven difficult. While facing similar climatic conditions, the Sound (i.e. a narrow strait located between the North and Baltic seas) differs from its neighbouring areas in the magnitude of fishing pressure as it is subjected to a local trawl fishing ban since 1932. By means of 3 independent multivariate analyses, we investigated the state and development of the Sound ecosystem, specifically testing for the occurrence of regime shifts and their potential drivers. By comparing the ecosystem development of the Sound with the neighbouring North and Baltic seas, we were able to demonstrate the positive effect of the trawl fishing ban on the resilience of the local cod stock to environmental change. The recovery and healthy condition of the Sound cod stock illustrate the need for adaptive marine management strategies that maximize ecosystem resilience.},

abstract = {Dissolved boron in modern seawater occurs in the form of two species, trigonal boric acid B(OH)3 and tetrahedral borate ion B(OH)4- One of the key assumption in the use of boron isotopic compositions of carbonates as pH proxy is that only borate ions, B(OH)4-, are incorporated into the carbonate. Here, we investigate the speciation of boron in deep-sea coral microstructures (Lophelia pertusa specimen) by using high field magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (11B MAS NMR) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). We observe both boron coordination species, but in different proportions depending on the coral microstructure, i.e. centres of calcification versus fibres. These results suggest that careful sampling is necessary before performing boron isotopic measurements in deep-sea corals. By combining the proportions of B(OH)3 and B(OH)4- determined by NMR and our previous ion microprobe boron isotope measurements, we propose a new equation for the relation between seawater pH and boron isotopic composition in deep-sea corals. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Genetic lineage tracings show that liver-derived iPS cells are derived from albumin-expressing cells. No common retroviral integration sites are found among multiple clones. These data suggest that iPS cells are generated by direct reprogramming of lineage-committed somatic cells and that retroviral integration into specific sites is not required.},

abstract = {Detection and precise quantification of the different carbonate minerals is crucial in selecting coral reef samples prior to geochemical and radiochronological measurements, thus helping to interpret changes in the mineralogical composition of geological formations made of reef material and associated sediments such as periplatform oozes. While powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a widely used method for mineralogical analysis, precise and accurate quantification of mineral abundance requires a thorough calibration of the instrument and method by means of gravimetric standards. In this study, we optimize a calibration method for the quantitative determination of four widespread Ca and Mg carbonates: calcite, aragonite, magnesian calcite (Mg-calcite) and dolomite. To detect and quantify very low calcite contents, which provide a crucial screening criterion for coral radiochronology, we perform a detailed survey of analytical precision and limits using two different XRD facilities. Detection and quantification limits (≈ 0.18{\%} and ≈ 0.9{\%} calcite in a calcite-aragonite mixture, respectively) are shown to be similar between the two instruments. The reproducibility of measurements clearly demonstrates that it is preferable to use peak area rather than peak height alone to obtain a precise quantification of the abundances of various carbonate minerals. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We also measured bottom water delta(13)C, Cd, and Ba at these sites. Foraminiferal delta(13)C values remain roughly constant over the entire depth range while bottom water delta(13)C values increase slightly, such that the delta(13)C difference between C, wuellerstorfi and bottom water ranges from about +0.2 parts per thousand in cores above 2.5 km to about -0.2 parts per thousand in cores below 4 km. This apparent depth dependence has not been previously reported, but this range in Delta delta(13)C values is comparable to the uncertainty in published delta(13)C calibration studies. We observe strong decreases in foraminiferal Cd/Ca, Ba/Ca, and Sr/Ca ratios (50, 25, and 15 percent, respectively) at water depths greater than about 2.5 km. These decreases are substantially larger than the corresponding changes in bottom water trace element concentrations, and they are not correlated with variations in pore water Cd and Ba concentrations at these sites. Together, the foraminiferal and bottom water Cd/Ca, Ba/Ca, and Sr/Ca data yield decreases in the apparent distribution coefficients for these metals into calcite with increasing water depth, again a pattern which has not been previously reported. These results when combined with the data from published core-top calibration studies suggest that a preferential loss of Cd, Ba, and Sr occurs during the dissolution of benthic foraminiferal calcite on the sea floor and raise the possibility of a dissolution-driven decrease in benthic foraminiferal delta(13)C values.},

abstract = {Calcified skeletons are produced within complex assemblages of proteins and polysaccharides whose roles in mineralization are not well understood. Here we quantify the kinetics of calcite nucleation onto a suite of high-purity polysaccharide (PS) substrates under controlled conditions. The energy barriers to nucleation are PS-specific by a systematic relationship to PS charge density and substrate structure that is rooted in minimization of the competing substrate-crystal and substrate-liquid interfacial energies. Chitosan presents a low-energy barrier to nucleation because its near-neutral charge favors formation of a substrate-crystal interface, thus reducing substrate interactions with water. Progressively higher barriers are measured for negatively charged alginates and heparin that favor contact with the solution over the formation of new substrate-crystal interfaces. The findings support a directing role for PS in biomineral formation and demonstrate that substrate-crystal interactions are one end-member in a larger continuum of competing forces that regulate heterogeneous crystal nucleation.},

abstract = {Lithium and calcium isotope ratios, together with the Li/Ca element ratio, have been measured in calcites precipitated inorganically at temperatures ranging from 5 to 30 °C, and on seasonal growth bands from a coral. These measurements indicate the potential uses of these three environmental proxies. Carbonate Li isotopes are lighter than the solution from which they grow, probably due to equilibrium fractionation. This fractionation is not significantly influenced by temperature and, because Li is not involved in any known biological process, this suggests that carbonates will provide a recorder for the past Li-isotope composition of natural waters and hence for past weathering conditions. As has been observed previously for inorganic aragonite, the Ca-isotopes in inorganic calcite are lighter than the growth solution, and are only weakly dependent on temperature. This confirms that the temperature dependence observed in some species of foraminifera [Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst. 1 (2001)] reflects additional isotope fractionation due to biological processes during mineralization. Ca isotopes may therefore provide a powerful tool with which to investigate the processes of biomineralization. Finally, Li/Ca ratios in inorganic and biogenic carbonates increase as temperatures decrease with a sensitivity of ≈4{\%} per °C. This temperature dependence of Li/Ca may prove useful to assess past temperatures in cold environments such as the deep ocean. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A clear relationship between integrated euphotic zone POC and calcite export combined with similarities in average ThE for calcite (0.26), opal (0.31), and POC (0.29) implies a potential association between biomineral and POC export. However, such similarity conceals substantial uncorrelated variability when ThE values are compared on regional scales, with ThE of POC often being much higher than that of calcite or opal. High-euphotic zone ThE for POC (0.3{\&}{\#}8211;0.4) relative to that found in deep sea sediment traps ({\textless}0.05) suggests that considerable remineralization occurs below the euphotic zone. We suggest (1) that regional variability in the mechanisms by which biominerals and POC become associated are more important in determining the efficient export of organic carbon than that of ballast materials; and (2) that, because of the preferential remineralization of POC relative to calcite/opal dissolution during subeuphotic processes, the potential for effective ballasting increases with depth in the water column.},

abstract = {Uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the oceans is altering seawater chemistry with potentially serious consequences for coral reef ecosystems due to the reduction of seawater pH and aragonite saturation state ($\Omega$arag). The objectives of this long-term study were to investigate the viability of two ecologically important reef-building coral species, massive Porites sp. and Stylophora pistillata, exposed to high pCO2 (or low pH) conditions and to observe possible changes in physiologically related parameters as well as skeletal isotopic composition. Fragments of Porites sp. and S. pistillata were kept for 6-14months under controlled aquarium conditions characterized by normal and elevated pCO2 conditions, corresponding to pHT values of 8.09, 7.49, and 7.19, respectively. In contrast with shorter, and therefore more transient experiments, the long experimental timescale achieved in this study ensures complete equilibration and steady state with the experimental environment and guarantees that the data provide insights into viable and stably growing corals. During the experiments, all coral fragments survived and added new skeleton, even at seawater $\Omega$arag{\textless}1, implying that the coral skeleton is formed by mechanisms under strong biological control. Measurements of boron (B), carbon (C), and oxygen (O) isotopic composition of skeleton, C isotopic composition of coral tissue and symbiont zooxanthellae, along with physiological data (such as skeletal growth, tissue biomass, zooxanthellae cell density, and chlorophyll concentration) allow for a direct comparison with corals living under normal conditions and sampled simultaneously. Skeletal growth and zooxanthellae density were found to decrease, whereas coral tissue biomass (measured as protein concentration) and zooxanthellae chlorophyll concentrations increased under high pCO2 (low pH) conditions. Both species showed similar trends of $\delta$11B depletion and $\delta$18O enrichment under reduced pH, whereas the $\delta$13C results imply species-specific metabolic response to high pCO2 conditions. The skeletal $\delta$11B values plot above seawater $\delta$11B vs. pH borate fractionation curves calculated using either the theoretically derived $\alpha$B value of 1.0194 (Kakihana et al. (1977) Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 50, 158) or the empirical $\alpha$B value of 1.0272 (Klochko et al. (2006) EPSL 248, 261). However, the effective $\alpha$B must be greater than 1.0200 in order to yield calculated coral skeletal $\delta$11B values for pH conditions where $\Omega$arag≥1. The $\delta$11B vs. pH offset from the seawater $\delta$11B vs. pH fractionation curves suggests a change in the ratio of skeletal material laid down during dark and light calcification and/or an internal pH regulation, presumably controlled by ion-transport enzymes. Finally, seawater pH significantly influences skeletal $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O. This must be taken into consideration when reconstructing paleo-environmental conditions from coral skeletons. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The locus encodes a protein of 341 amino acid residues with four WD40 repeats. The protein is similar to AN11, a regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in petunia, and more distantly related to those of the beta subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, which suggests a role for TTG1 in signal transduction to downstream transcription factors.

abstract = {It is shown that the melting of ice floating on the ocean will introduce a volume of water about 2.6 per cent greater than that of the originally displaced sea water. The melting of floating ice in a global warming will cause the ocean to rise. If all the extant sea ice and floating shelf ice melted, the global sea level would rise about 4 cm. The sliding of grounded ice into the sea, however, produces a mean water level rise in two parts; some of the rise is delayed. The first part, while the ice floats, is equal to the volume of displaced sea water. The second part, equal to 2.6 per cent of the first, is contributed as it melts. These effects result from the difference in volume of equal weights of fresh and salt water. This component of sea rise is apparently unrecognized in the literature to date, although it can be interpreted as a form of halosteric sea level change by regarding the displaced salt water and the meltwater (even before melting) as a unit. Although salinity changes are known to affect sea level, all existing analyses omit our calculated volume change. We present a protocol that can be used to calculate global sea level rise on the basis of the addition of meltwater from grounded and floating ice; of course thermosteric volume change must be added.},

The number and spacing of these bands is consistent with a diurnal origin, modulated by changing pH within the foraminiferal microenvironment due to the day-night, photosynthesis-respiration cycle of algal symbionts. The amplitude of Mg/Ca variation within individual tests and across many daily growth bands cannot be accounted for by seawater temperature in the shallow, euphotic zone habitat of O. universa. Our results indicate the Mg/Ca composition of calcite precipitated by O. universa in nature is strongly influenced by diurnal changes in the biological activity of algal symbionts and the host foraminifer. This brings into question the fundamental premise often made in applying Mg/Ca palaeoseawater thermometry, that the Mg/Ca composition of foraminiferal calcite is determined by seawater temperature, and whether the Mg/Ca composition of other planktonic species that are more widely used for palaeoseawater thermometry are subject to similar influences. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The assessments of potential environmental impacts of point and diffuse source pollution at regional scales are necessary to achieve the sustainable development of natural resources such as land and water. Nutrient related diffuse source pollutant inputs can enhance crop growth and improve soil eutrophication. However, excessive nutrient input can result in the impairment of water quality. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the long-term impact of point and diffuse source pollution on nitrate load in a lowland catchment using the ecohydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and to determine the contribution of point and diffuse sources to nitrate load in the entire catchment. The study area Kielstau catchment has a size of approximately 50 km2 and is located in the North German lowlands. The water quality is not only influenced by the predominating agricultural land use in the catchment as cropland and pasture, but also by six municipal wastewater treatment plants. Diffuse entries as well as punctual entries from the wastewater treatment plants are implemented in the model set-up. The model was first calibrated and then validated in a daily time step. The values of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency for the simulations of flow and nitrate load range from 0.68 to 0.75 for the calibration period and from 0.76 to 0.78 for the validation period. These statistical results revealed that the SWAT model performed satisfactorily in simulating daily flow and nitrate load in lowland catchment of Northern Germany. The results showed that diffuse sources are the main contributor to nitrate load in the entire catchment accounting for about 95{\%} of the total nitrate load, while only 5{\%} results from point sources. The model results also indicated that agriculture is the dominant contributor of diffuse sources and the percentage of agricultural land area is considerably positively correlated to nitrate load at the different subbasins. The area covered by forest is found to be negatively correlated with nitrate load. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The effects of growth kinetics, temperature and solution composition on Mn2+ and Fe2+ incorporation into calcite were investigated. Mn- or Fe-bearing overgrowths on calcite seeds were precipitated at 10??, 25?? and 50??C from solutions with various metal Ca2+ molar ratios over a range of precipitation rates using a "chemo-stat" technique. Homogeneous distribution coefficients for Fe2+ (DFe2+) and Mn2+ (DMn2+) incorporation increase with decreasing precipitation rate or increasing temperature. Although previous work suggested a decrease in DMn2+ with increasing temperature, this likely is attributable to concurrent increases in precipitation rate. At the temperatures investigated, DMn2+ is greater than DFe2+ and the ratio DMn2+ DFe2+ increases with decreasing precipitation rate. DMn2+ varied from 3.8 to 16 over a range of precipitation rates of 450 to 45,000 ??mol m-2 hr.-1 at 25??C. Mn-calcite compositions ranged from 0.5 to 40 mol{\%} MnCO3 over all of the solution Mn2+ Ca2+ ratios investigated and a small decrease (???20{\%}) in DMn2+ was observed in solutions with the highest Mn2+ Ca2+ ratio. The dependence of DMn2+ on precipitation rate was unaffected by an order of magnitude change in PCO2, but a small difference was observed with an order of magnitude change in CaCl2 concentration. DMn2+ varied from 3 to 11 at 10??C and from 8 to 22 at 50??C over a similar range of precipitation rates. DFe2+ varied from 1.9 to 3.7 for precipitation rates from 800 to 50,000 ??mol m-2 hr.-1 at 25??C and the Fe-calcites contained {\textless}0.4 mol{\%} FeCO3. DFe2+ exhibited a more pronounced, but still relatively small, decrease with increasing Fe2+ concentration. DFe2+ varied from 1.5 to 2.3 at 10??C and from 2.8 to 7.7 at 50??C. Application of these results to the interpretation of Fe and Mn content in diagenetic calcites is discussed. Effects of precipitation rate and temperature on DMn2+ and DFe2+ could produce compositional variations in calcite cements causing cathodoluminescent zoning, but are unlikely to be responsible for the major variations commonly observed in natural cements. ?? 1990.},

Originally, it was thought that an ion's influence on macromolecular properties was caused at least in part by 'making' or 'breaking' bulk water structure. Recent time-resolved and thermodynamic studies of water molecules in salt solutions, however, demonstrate that bulk water structure is not central to the Hofmeister effect. Instead, models are being developed that depend upon direct ion-macromolecule interactions as well as interactions with water molecules in the first hydration shell of the macromolecule. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, no direct proxy for past levels of pCO2 ex- ists beyond the reach of the polar ice core records. We pro- pose a new methodology for placing a constraint on pCO2 over the Cenozoic based on the physiological plasticity of extant coccolithophores. Specifically, our premise is that the contrasting calcification tolerance1 of various extant species of coccolithophore to raised pCO2 reflects an “evolutionary memory” of past atmospheric composition. The different times of evolution of certain morphospecies allows an upper constraint of past pCO2 to be placed on Cenozoic timeslices. Further, our hypothesis has implications for the response of marine calcifiers to ocean acidification.

abstract = {A numerical model for the diagenetic exchange of Sr between carbonates and their pore fluids during sedimentation and compaction has been developed. The model has been applied to data from DSDP Site 590B in order to assess the accuracy with which the Sr isotope record in the carbonate sediment reflects that of seawater. The most important process affecting the Sr in the solid carbonate is exchange with the pore fluid due to solution-reprecipitation, but the concentration or isotopic composition of Sr in the solid itself gives little or no information as to the magnitude of this exchange. The key to determining the rate of exchange is the pore fluid, where the variations of Sr2+ and 87Sr86Sr with depth are very sensitive indicators. The logical structure of applying the model to data from DSDP 590B is to find by successive iteration an ocean history (i.e., the initial 87Sr86Sr and Sr concentration of each increment of carbonate deposited) and a rate of Sr exchange between pore water and solid carbonate such that the model matches the present Sr concentration and 87Sr86Sr of both pore water and solid carbonate. Once all the data are matched, the model provides an estimate of the rate of Sr exchange due to solution-reprecipitation and the evolution of 87Sr86Sr in seawater over the past 20 million years. For DSDP 590B we find that solution-reprecipitation decreases rapidly with depth, from a near surface value of about 10{\%} per million years to about 1{\%} per million years below 200 m. This rate of exchange of Sr results in the carbonates of DSDP 590B preserving an accurate record of the Sr isotopic evolution of the ocean over the past 5 million years, but for ages greater than 5 million years the 87Sr86Sr ratio of the carbonate is systematically displaced from that of the seawater in which it was deposited. The maximum difference is of order 5 ?? 10-5. ?? 1987.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic carbon dioxide has been accumulating in the oceans, lowering both the concentration of carbonate ions and the pH (ref. 1), resulting in the acidification of sea water. Previous laboratory experiments have shown that decreased carbonate ion concentrations cause many marine calcareous organisms to show reduced calcification rates(2-5). If these results are widely applicable to ocean settings, ocean acidification could lead to ecosystem shifts. Planktonic foraminifera are single-celled calcite-secreting organisms that represent between 25 and 50{\%} of the total open-ocean marine carbonate flux(6) and influence the transport of organic carbon to the ocean interior(7). Here we compare the shell weights of the modern foraminifer Globigerina bulloides collected from sediment traps in the Southern Ocean with the weights of shells preserved in the underlying Holocene-aged sediments. We find that modern shell weights are 30-35{\%} lower than those from the sediments, consistent with reduced calcification today induced by ocean acidification. We also find a link between higher atmospheric carbon dioxide and low shell weights in a 50,000-year-long record obtained from a Southern Ocean marine sediment core. It is unclear whether reduced calcification will affect the survival of this and other species, but a decline in the abundance of foraminifera caused by acidification could affect both marine ecosystems and the oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide.},

The percentage of DOC production with respect to total integrated primary production ranged from 4 to 42{\%}, being larger in oligotrophic, picoplankton-dominated waters, where a balanced metabolism of the micro- bial community was observed, than in productive, net autotrophic waters, where large-sized cells formed the bulk of the phytoplankton biomass. A highly significant relationship was calculated between DOC and POC production rates in upwelling conditions.

abstract = {The causal mechanisms responsible for the abrupt climate changes of the Last Glacial Period remain unclear. One major difficulty is dating ice-rafted debris deposits associated with Heinrich events: Extensive iceberg influxes into the North Atlantic Ocean linked to global impacts on climate and biogeochemistry. In a new ice core record of atmospheric methane with ultrahigh temporal resolution, we find abrupt methane increases within Heinrich stadials 1, 2, 4, and 5 that, uniquely, have no counterparts in Greenland temperature proxies. Using a heuristic model of tropical rainfall distribution, we propose that Hudson Strait Heinrich events caused rainfall intensification over Southern Hemisphere land areas, thereby producing excess methane in tropical wetlands. Our findings suggest that the climatic impacts of Heinrich events persisted for 740 to 1520 years.},

abstract = {The feasibility of using a focused ion beam (FIB) for the purpose of thinning vitreously frozen biological specimens for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was explored. A concern was whether heat transfer beyond the direct ion interaction layer might devitrify the ice. To test this possibility, we milled vitreously frozen water on a standard TEM grid with a 30-keV Ga(+) beam, and cryo-transferred the grid to a TEM for examination. Following FIB milling of the vitreous ice from a thickness of approximately 1200 nm to 200-150 nm, changes characteristic of heat-induced devitrification were not observed by TEM, in either images or diffraction patterns. Although numerous technical challenges remain, it is anticipated that 'cryo-FIB thinning' of bulk frozen-hydratred material will be capable of producing specimens for TEM cryo-tomography with much greater efficiency than cryo-ultramicrotomy, and without the specimen distortions and handling difficulties of the latter.},

abstract = {Foraminifera are unicellular organisms that inhabit the oceans in various ecosystems. The majority of the foraminifera precipitate calcitic shells and are among the major CaCO(3) producers in the oceans. They comprise an important component of the global carbon cycle and also provide valuable paleoceanographic information based on the relative abundance of stable isotopes and trace elements (proxies) in their shells. Understanding the biomineralization processes in foraminifera is important for predicting their calcification response to ocean acidification and for reliable interpretation of the paleoceanographic proxies. Most models of biomineralization invoke the involvement of membrane ion transporters (channels and pumps) in the delivery of Ca(2+) and other ions to the calcification site. Here we show, in contrast, that in the benthic foraminiferan Amphistegina lobifera, (a shallow water species), transport of seawater via fluid phase endocytosis may account for most of the ions supplied to the calcification site. During their intracellular passage the seawater vacuoles undergo alkalization that elevates the CO(3)(2-) concentration and further enhances their calcifying potential. This mechanism of biomineralization may explain why many calcareous foraminifera can be good recorders of paleoceanographic conditions. It may also explain the sensitivity to ocean acidification that was observed in several planktonic and benthic species.},

We examine whether the trace metal barium (Ba) deposits into the calcium carbonate matrix of molluscan larval statolith and protoconch in proportion to seawater Ba concentration at two temperatures (11.5 and 17??C). We also examine strontium (Sr) uptake as a function of temperature. Using encapsulated larvae of the marine gastropod, Kelletia kelletii, reared in the laboratory under controlled conditions, we demonstrate a significant inverse effect of temperature and a positive effect of seawater Ba/Ca ratio on Ba incorporation into larval carbonates. Ba/Ca partition coefficients ( D Ba ) in protoconch were 1.13 at 11.4??C and 0.88 at 17.1??C, while D Ba in larval statolith measured 1.58 at 11.4??C and 1.29 at 17.1??C. Strontium incorporation into statoliths is also inversely affected by temperature, but there was a significant positive effect of temperature on Sr incorporation into protoconch. These data suggest larval statoliths and protoconchs can meaningfully record variation in seawater physical and chemical properties, and, hence, have potential as natural tags of natal origin. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a requirement for malignant tumor growth and metastasis. In the absence of angiogenesis, local tumor expansion is suppressed at a few millimeters and cells lack routes for distant hematogenous spread. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the degree of angiogenesis is correlated with the malignant potential of several cancers, including breast cancer and malignant melanoma. Moreover, the expression of a specific angiogenesis marker, the endothelial integrin alphaVbeta3, has been shown to correlate with tumor grade. However, studies of tumor angiogenesis such as these have generally relied on invasive procedures, adequate tissue sampling and meticulous estimation of histologic microvessel density. In the present report, we describe a novel approach to detecting angiogenesis in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a paramagnetic contrast agent targeted to endothelial alphaVbeta3 via the LM609 monoclonal antibody. This approach provided enhanced and detailed imaging of rabbit carcinomas by directly targeting paramagnetic agents to the angiogenic vasculature. In addition, angiogenic 'hot spots' not seen by standard MRI were detected. Our strategy for MR imaging of alphaVbeta3 thus represents a non-invasive means to assess the growth and malignant phenotype of tumors.},

The chemicals, iron chloride, slaked lime and calcium nitrate, were injected into the sediments, improving the binding capacity for phosphorus and reducing the amounts of easily degradable organic matter. The nutrient recycling to the water body, as well as the biological oxygen demand (BOD) at the sediment surface, were thus reduced. In Lake Lillesjon, Sweden, a drastic reduction of the nutrient levels and an improvement of the oxygen conditions in the water near the bottom during summer 1975 were achieved. The method is less expensive, and more rapid than sediment dredging methods. Restricted areas of sediments with high oxygen demand can be treated, and the recycling of phosphorus from these polluted sediments thus avoided.},

Because so many biomineral products are derived from an initial solution phase and are either completely crystalline or include crystalline components, an understanding of the physical principles of crystallization from solutions is an important tool for students of biomineralization. However, crystal growth is a science of great breadth and depth, about which many extensive texts have been written. In addition, there are already other thorough reviews that specifically address the crystal growth field of study as it relates to biomineral formation. Consequently, the goals of this chapter are both modest and specific. It is intended to provide: 1) a simple narrative explaining the physical principles behind crystallization for those who are completely new to the topic, 2) a few basic equations governing nucleation and growth for those who wish to apply those principlesat least in a semi-quantitative fashionto experimental observations of mineralization, and 3) an overview of some recent molecular-scale studies that have revealed new insights into the control of crystal growth by small molecules, both organic and inorganic.},

abstract = {We have extended the 3-D ocean based "Grid EN-abled Integrated Earth system model" (GENIE-1) to help understand the role of ocean biogeochemistry and marine sediments in the long-term (similar to 100 to 100 000 year) regulation of atmospheric CO2, and the importance of feedbacks between CO2 and climate. Here we describe the ocean carbon cycle, which in its first incarnation is based around a simple single nutrient (phosphate) control on biological productivity. The addition of calcium carbonate preservation in deep-sea sediments and its role in regulating atmospheric CO2 is presented elsewhere (Ridgwell and Hargreaves, 2007). We have calibrated the model parameters controlling ocean carbon cycling in GENIE-1 by assimilating 3-D observational datasets of phosphate and alkalinity using an ensemble Kalman filter method. The calibrated (mean) model predicts a global export production of particulate organic carbon (POC) of 8.9 PgC yr(-1), and reproduces the main features of dissolved oxygen distributions in the ocean. For estimating biogenic calcium carbonate (CaCO3) production, we have devised a parameterization in which the CaCO3: POC export ratio is related directly to ambient saturation state. Calibrated global CaCO3 export production (1.2 PgC yr-1) is close to recent marine carbonate budget estimates. The GENIE-1 Earth system model is capable of simulating a wide variety of dissolved and isotopic species of relevance to the study of modern global biogeochemical cycles as well as past global environmental changes recorded in paleoceanographic proxies. Importantly, even with 12 active biogeochemical tracers in the ocean and including the calculation of feedbacks between atmospheric CO2 and climate, we achieve better than 1000 years per (2.4 GHz) CPU hour on a desktop PC. The GENIE-1 model thus provides a viable alternative to box and zonally-averaged models for studying global biogeochemical cycling over all but the very longest ({\textgreater} 1 000 000 year) time-scales.},

The molar Mg and Sr distribution coefficients Kd[Mg] and KD[Sr] for modern Australian Cyprideis specimens (Chivas et al. 1986b), KD[Mg] at 25??C=(Mg/Ca)shell/(Mg/Ca)water=0.00458??0.00072KD[Sr]=(Sr/Ca)water/(Sr/Ca)water=0.475??0.057 are used here to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental record of the gulf. The two cores studied show similar patterns during the past 40,000 yr for equivalent hydrologic phases recognized in the cores. The Mg/Ca ratios of the water inferred from ostracod shell chemistry indicate that Carpentaria was a fresh or slightly saline lake between ??? 40,000 and ??? 13,000 yr B.P., before being transgressed by the sea during sea level rise. Around 26,000 yr B.P., a phase of substantial precipitation of authigenic calcite caused a dramatic increase in the Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios of the lake water, and this was registered by the ostracod shell chemistry. From ??? 26,000 to ??? 13,000 yr B.P., the lake remained fresh or slightly saline despite the Ca depletion of the water which caused the Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca of the ostracods to be unusually high. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {We have extended the GENIE-1 Earth system model to include a representation of sedimentary stratigraphy and the preservation of biogenic carbonates delivered to the ocean floor. This has enabled us to take a novel approach in diagnosing modern marine carbon cycling - assimilating observations of the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content of deep-sea sediments with an ensemble Kalman filter. The resulting calibrated model predicts a mean surface sediment content (32.5 wt{\%}) close to the observed value (34.8 wt{\%}), and a global burial rate of CaCO3 in deep sea sediments of 0.121 PgC yr-1, in line with recent budget estimates of 0.10-0.14 PgC yr-1. We employ the GENIE-1 model in quantifying the multi millennial-scale fate of fossil fuel CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. In the absence of any interaction between ocean and sediments, an equilibrium partitioning of CO2 is reached within {\~{}}1000 years of emissions ceasing, with 34{\%} (645 ppm) remaining in the atmosphere out of a total fossil fuel burn of 4173 PgC. An additional 12{\%} of CO2 emissions (223 ppm) are sequestered as bicarbonate ions ( 3 HCO ) by reaction with deep-sea carbonates ('sea-floor CaCO3 neutralization') on a time-scale of {\~{}}1.7 kyr. Excess of carbonate weathering on land over deep-sea burial results in a further net transformation of 14{\%} of CO2 emissions (261 ppm) into . 3 HCO ('terrestrial CaCO3 neutralization') on a time-scale of {\~{}}8.3 kyr. We have also assessed the importance of a changing climate in modulating the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 through ocean-sediment interaction. Increased ocean stratification suppresses particulate organic carbon export, which in turn enhances sea-floor CaCO3 preservation. The resulting reduction in the sequestration of fossil fuel CO2 represents a new positive feedback on millennial-scale climate change},

abstract = {We report a total evaporation negative ion thermal mass spectrometry (TE-NTIMS) technique that enables precise and accurate (± 0.7‰; 2 s.d.) measurements of boron isotope ratios. The fundamental advantage of TE-NTIMS is that the effect of instrumental mass fractionation is minimised and sample signal maximised by analysing samples to exhaustion. We can analyse as little as 300 pg of B, which enables repeat analyses of dissolutions of small numbers of foraminifera (as little as 0.1 mg or ∼10 individual foraminfera). This represents a several fold reduction in the number of tests required compared to previous NTIMS studies and brings the amount of sample into line with other commonly used paleo-proxies. Standard addition experiments indicate that the 11B /10B ratio of the NIST SRM 951 standard is not biased by differing amounts of seawater or carbonate matrix and yield an 11B /10B within error of the certified value. We also show that our sample preparation induces no additional variations (e.g. blank contribution) beyond our analytical uncertainty. We obtain 11B /10B ratios for seawater within error of values obtained using plasma ionisation, positive and negative thermal ionisation mass-spectrometry. Our measurements of core-top G. sacculifer from three ocean basins yield $\delta$11B within analytical error (23.3-24.3‰) and fall within the range of published values. This study, however, further highlights significant interlaboratory biases in isotopic compositions of core-top foraminifera. Significantly, we show that our approach is not influenced by processing blank nor systematic differences in mass bias between measurements of sample and standard, which has yet to be documented for some other laboratories. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Minor element and isotopic compositions of marine bivalve calcite are frequently used as proxy records of seawater temperature and salinity. Although molluscan calcite is secreted at or near oxygen isotope equilibrium, the influence of metabolic activity (i.e., vital effects) on skeletal Sr/Ca ratios and ??13C values is not well known. We present measurements of skeletal chemistry from (a) consecutive samples milled in chronological order from the organism's final year of growth and (b) adjacent samples within three separate growth bands of the marine mussel Mytilus trossulus to investigate chemical disequilibrium effects among different parts of the shell. Seawater temperature and salinity were monitored for one year at Squirrel Cove, British Columbia. At the end of the year, a young, rapidly growing mussel (mussel A) and an old, slowly growing mussel (mussel B) were harvested from this site. Growth bands within the shells were sampled to provide a chronological record of shell carbonate chemistry. Results from consecutive samples show (1) a significantly higher average Sr/Ca ratio in mussel A than that in mussel B and (2) ??13C values that correlate well with salinity in mussel A but not in mussel B. Results from time-equivalent, adjacent samples show (1) higher Sr/Ca and ??13C values near the ventral margin than at time-equivalent regions on lateral margins of the shell and (2) little or no variation in ??18O values. These observations suggest that skeletal chemistry (Sr/Ca and ??13C) is primarily controlled by rate of mantle metabolic activity and secondarily modified by variation in seawater salinity. Because metabolic activity in the mantle at the site of carbonate precipitation varies with shell curvature, the composition of calcite secreted along lateral margins is influenced to a greater extent by metabolic activity than calcite secreted coevally at the central margin of the shell. Hence, the chemistry of calcite secreted at the ventral margin is precipitated in near-equilibrium with seawater and allows accurate estimation of seawater Sr/Ca ratios and carbon isotopic composition. In contrast, shell precipitation along lateral margins is dominantly controlled by metabolic activity, and calcite chemistry is not in equilibrium with ambient seawater. In this context, we present a biomineralization model where variations in skeletal Sr/ Ca and ??13C values are explained in the context of mantle metabolic activity and seawater salinity.},

abstract = {Archived wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain and straw, and soil samples from the control plot of the Rothamsted Broadbalk Experiment, located in southeastern England and established in 1843, were used to investigate the effects of dramatically changing SO2 pollution inputs on the concentrations and stable isotope ratios (delta34S) of S in the samples. Representative coal samples from UK major coal fields were also determined for delta34S. Concentrations of S showed no clear trends in either grain or straw over the 155 years from 1845 to 1999. However, grain and straw delta34S decreased rapidly from 6 to 7/1000 in 1845 to -2 to -5/1000 in the early 1970s, and since then have increased to 0.5 to 2/1000 in the late 1990s. This pattern mirrored the trend of UK SO2 emissions over the 155 years. Both grain and straw delta34S correlated strongly and negatively with UK SO2 emissions (R2 {\textgreater} 0.89), but the relationships were different for the pre- and post-1970 data sets. Soil delta34S also decreased considerably, from 8.2/1000 in 1865 to 3.7 to 4.5/1000 during 1965-1999. A negative delta34S value was inferred for the anthropogenic S deposited at the experimental site before 1970, and further confirmed by negative delta34S values (-6 to -10/1000) found in the coal samples from southeastern England and southern Wales. Based on the S isotope ratios, we estimated that anthropogenic S contributed 62 to 78{\%} of the S uptake by wheat at the peak of SO2 emissions, and accounted for 28 to 37{\%} of the topsoil S in 1965.},

abstract = {The boron to calcium ratio (B/Ca) in biogenic CaCO3 is being increasingly utilized as a proxy for past ocean carbonate chemistry. However, B/Ca of cultured and core-top foraminifers show dependence on multiple physicochemical seawater properties and only a few of those have been inorganically tested for their impacts. Accordingly, our understanding of the controls on foraminiferal B/Ca and thus how to interpret B/Ca in fossil shells is incomplete. To gain a clearer understanding of the B incorporation mechanism, we performed inorganic calcite precipitation experiments using a pH-stat system. As previously reported, we confirm that B/Ca in calcite increases with both fluid pH and total B concentration (denoted as [BT], where [BT]=[B(OH)3]+[B(OH)4-]). We provide the first evidence that B/Ca also increases with the concentration of total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and calcium ion. With the exception of the [BT] experiments, these chemical manipulations were accompanied by an increase in calcite saturation, and accordingly precipitation rate (denoted as R). But when pH and [Ca2+] were jointly varied at a fixed saturation level to maintain relatively constant R at different pH and [Ca2+] combinations, B/Ca was insensitive to both pH and [Ca2+] changes. These experimental results unequivocally suggest kinetic effects related to R on B/Ca. Furthermore, with a suite of chemical manipulations we found that the B/Ca variability is explicable by just R and the [BT]/[DIC] ratio in the parent fluids. This observation was particularly robust for relatively rapidly precipitated samples, whereas for relatively slowly precipitated samples, it was somewhat ambiguous whether the [BT]/[DIC] or [B(OH)4-]/[HCO3-] ratio provides a better fit to the experimental data. Nonetheless, our experimental results can be considered as indirect evidence for incorporation of both B(OH)4- and B(OH)3 into calcite. We propose a simple mathematical expression to describe the mode of B incorporation into synthetic calcite that depends only on the fluid [BT]/[DIC] ratio and the precipitation rate R. This novel finding has important implications for future calibrations and applications of the B/Ca proxy as well as the $\delta$11B paleo-pH proxy.},

Mg Ca and Na Ca in the shells did not vary with changes of these ratios in the culture solution. These are the first direct determinations of the relationship between foraminiferal shell chemistry and solution composition. The possibility of temperature dependence for the minor elemental composition of foraminiferal shells was also investigated in the laboratory and by analysis of several planktonic and one benthic foraminiferal species from sediment trap and sediment core samples. The Sr Ca, Mg Ca, and Na Ca ratios in the natural samples roughly correlate with calcification temperature, whereas differences in the Li/Ca ratios are small and not systematically related to temperature. However, laboratory culture experiments at 20??C and 30??C showed no variation in the Li Ca, Sr Ca, Mg Ca, and Na Ca ratios with calcification temperature for the planktonic foraminifera G. sacculifer and Orbulina universa. Therefore, observed differences in the Sr Ca, Mg Ca, and Na Ca ratios for the sediment trap and core foraminiferal samples cannot be ascribed to direct effects of calcification temperature, but may be due to some other environmental factor which is correlated with temperature. ?? 1985.},

These are important characteristics that influence the performance of petroleum reservoirs. This first paper investigates the adsorption of model organic compounds to determine what type of compounds adsorb, the nature and strength of the adsorption, and the influence of adsorption on rock wettability. A wide variety of model organic compounds were tested for adsorption on calcite, dolomite and magnesite. They were adsorbed from both organic and aqueous solvents. The adsorption was monitored by thermogravimetric analysis and by contact angle wettability tests. The compounds included carboxylic acids, alcohols, sulfates, sulfonates, amines, amino acids and carboxylated polymers. Carboxylic acids adsorb most strongly, and their adsorption is stabilized by long, straight chains and by polymeric structures. Fatty acids form a surface monolayer, and carboxylated polymers also appear to coat the surface completely. These adsorbates could be desorbed only by a solvent that provided both good solubility for the adsorbate and an ionic species to replace it at the solid surface. They were interpreted to be chemisorbed as ionic species. Several other compounds exhibited physisorption and could be easily removed by most solvents. Wettability tests were performed at 20??, 50?? and 80??C to obtain information regarding the stability of the adsorption at elevated temperatures. ?? 1993.},

They are easy-to-use, simple-to-design, and capable of targeting multiple loci simultaneously. Given that cancer develops from cumulative genetic and epigenetic alterations, CRISPR-Cas9 and its variants (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-Cas9 systems) hold extensive application potentials in cancer modeling and therapy. To date, they have already been applied to model oncogenic mutations in cell lines1 and in adult animals2 , as well as to combat cancer by disabling oncogenic viruses3 or by manipulating cancer genome4 . Given the importance of epigenome and transcriptome in tumorigenesis, manipulation of cancer epigenome and transcriptome for cancer modeling and therapy is a promising area in the future. Whereas (epi)genetic modifications of cancer microenvironment with CRISPR-Cas9 systems for therapeutic purposes represent another promising area in cancer research. Herein, we introduce the functions and mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 systems in genome editing and epigenome modulation, retrospect their applications in cancer modelling and therapy, discuss limitations and possible solutions, and propose future directions, in hope of providing concise and enlightening information for readers interested in this area.

The transformed polymorphs are vaterite and calcite at low temperature (14 to 30??C), and aragonite and calcite at high temperature (60 to 80??C). At intermediate temperatures (40 to 50??C) the formation of all three polymorphs was observed. Metastable polymorphs are gradually transformed to the stable form, calcite. It takes about 200 min at 25??C and 370 min at 30??C for the complete transformation of vaterite to calcite, and 1000-1300 min for that of aragonite to calcite at 60-80??C. At 50??C, vaterite is predominantly transformed at first to aragonite within 60 min, and then the aragonite is transformed to calcite in about 900 min. The results of the change in the ion activity product of the solution and the abundances of the polymorphs strongly suggest that the polymorphic transformation of vaterite and aragonite to calcite takes place through dissolution of the metastable phase and growth of the stable phase, calcite. The rate-determining step of the transformation is the growth of calcite. The relative abundance of vaterite becomes higher at 25??C with increasing concentrations of calcium and carbonate ions in the supersaturated solution. When the ion activity product of the initial supersaturated solution is lower than the solubility product of ACC at 25??C, only vaterite directly precipitates after some induction period. The vaterite crystals formed are free of calcite seeds and the vaterite saturated solutions are stable for several days. ?? 1987.},

@article{Harvey2009,
abstract = {Glycolysis, the citric acid cycle and other metabolic pathways of living organisms generate potentially toxic acids within all cells. One ubiquitous mechanism for ridding cells of the acids is to expel H(+) in exchange for extracellular Na(+), mediated by electroneutral transporters called Na(+)/H(+) exchangers (NHEs) that are driven by Na(+) concentration gradients. The exchange must be important because the human genome contains 10 NHEs along with two Na(+)/H(+) antiporters (NHAs). By contrast, the genomes of two principal disease vector mosquitoes, Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti, contain only three NHEs along with the two NHAs. This shortfall may be explained by the presence of seven nutrient amino acid transporters (NATs) in the mosquito genomes. NATs transport Na(+) stoichiometrically linked to an amino acid into the cells by a process called symport or co-transport. Three of the mosquito NATs and two caterpillar NATs have previously been investigated after heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and were found to be voltage driven (electrophoretic). Moreover, the NATs are present in the same membrane as the H(+) V-ATPase, which generates membrane potentials as high as 120 mV. We review evidence that the H(+) V-ATPase moves H(+) out of the cells and the resulting membrane potential (V(m)) drives Na(+) linked to an amino acid into the cells via a NAT. The H(+) efflux by the V-ATPase and Na(+) influx by the NAT comprise the same ion exchange as that mediated by an NHE; so the V and NAT working together constitute an NHE that we call NHE(VNAT). As the H(+) V-ATPase is widely distributed in mosquito epithelial cells and there are seven NATs in the mosquito genomes, there are potentially seven NHE(VNAT)s that could replace the missing NHEs. We review published evidence in support of this hypothesis and speculate about broader functions of NHE(VNAT)s.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the influence of sediment physical and chemical characteristics on the degradation of deposited organic matter, decomposition in three sediments from the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea) that differ in permeability and mineral composition were compared. Freeze-dried Spirulina was added to coarse carbonate and silicate sands from a shallow nearshore region and silt-clay sediment from the deeper center region of the Gulf incubated in laboratory chambers. The stirring in the chambers caused higher solute exchange in the coarse permeable sands relative to the fine less permeable silt due to the generation of advective fluid exchange between the sediment and overlying water. This enhanced exchange increased the decomposition rates of organic matter in the incubated sands. The decomposition rates of total organic carbon in the permeable carbonate (3.0mg C m-2 d-1) and silicate sands (2.0 mg C m-2 d-1) exceeded that in the fine-grained sediment (1.4 mg C m-2 d-1). Oxygen consumption in the coarse sands was 3-fold higher than in the silt-clay sediment, with highest rates in the carbonate sand. In carbonate and silicate sands of the same grain size, the carbonate sediment was more permeable than the silicate, resulting in 1.4-fold higher fluid exchange rates and 1.4-fold larger sedimentary organic matter mineralization rates. An in situ experiment comparing trapping efficiencies in carbonate and silicate sands showed that the higher fluid exchange rate in the carbonate sand results in larger filtration rates and a faster accumulation of particulate organic matter from the boundary layer. These experiments demonstrate that with respect to sedimentary mineralization rates, higher transport rates in permeable coarse sediments can outweigh the effect of a higher specific surface area in fine-grained silt sediments. In permeable sands, however, the higher specific surface area and fluid exchange in biogenic carbonate sands result in higher mineralization rates than in silicate sands of the same grain size. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The crystallization process occurs in two stages; firstly, the particles of ACC rapidly dehydrate and crystallize to form individual particles of vaterite; secondly, the vaterite transforms to calcite via a dissolution and reprecipitation mechanism with the reaction rate controlled by the surface area of calcite. The second stage of the reaction is approximately 10 times slower than the first. Activation energies of calcite nucleation and crystallization are 73 +/- 10 and 66 +/- 2 kJ mol(-1), respectively. A model to calculate the degree of calcite crystallization from ACC at environmentally relevant temperatures (7.5-40 degrees C) is also presented.},

abstract = {Previous models and calculations of the global mass balance of Sr in the oceans have shown that the input of unradiogenic basaltic Sr from on-axis midocean ridge hydrothermal systems is much less than needed to balance the input of radiogenic Sr delivered to the oceans by rivers. The implication is that either the oceans are far from steady state with respect to Sr isotope balance (and that the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of seawater is increasing at unprecedented rates) or that there is a significant missing source of basaltic Sr. It has long been recognized that off-axis hydrothermal fluxes might significantly affect the mass and isotopic balance of Sr and other elements in the oceans, but nearly all previous work has concluded that the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of pore fluids in ridge-flank hydrothermal areas is virtually indistinguishable from the seawater ratio or is dominated by authigenic carbonates. In contrast, we report here the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of warm springs, sediment pore fluids, and basement reservoir fluid with a clear basaltic signature from the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca ridge (JFR). Fluids venting from Ocean Drilling Program Hole 1026B on the Juan de Fuca east flank have relatively stable Sr isotope and major element composition for the 3 yr following drilling. These results and similar results recently reported by Elderfield et al. (1999) indicate that low-temperature ridge-flank hydrothermal circulation has an important effect on the Sr isotope balance in the oceans. If published values for the other major sources of Sr input to the oceans (rivers and axial hydrothermal flux) are accurate, then the rate of increase of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in seawater (?? 0.000054 per million years) can be accommodated if ridge flanks on a global scale deliver fluids to the ocean with ?? (87Sr/86Sr)/heat ratios one third to one half of the ratio found in warm JFR basement fluids. Based on published Sr and O isotope signatures of calcite veins in the uppermost basaltic ocean crust, the average ?? (87Sr/86Sr)/heat ratio of low-temperature fluids is in the range required to balance the oceanic Sr isotope budget. Although the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the JFR flank fluids in this study overlap with fluid properties inferred from some calcite veins in the upper oceanic crust, the magnitudes of the ?? (87Sr/86Sr)/heat ratios of nearly all of the JFR flank fluids are too large to be representative of the average global flank fluid flux; the same has been argued on the basis of the extremely high implied Mg flux.

abstract = {To assess abnormal warming of temperature in southwest Japan's coastal seas during the twentieth century, we developed a 200 yr interannually resolved record of planktonic and benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca-based temperature using neritic coastal sediment cores. The winter to late spring bottom temperature (50 m) record, based on benthic foraminiferal (Nonion japonicum) Mg/Ca ratios in the Bungo Channel (BC), showed consistent variation with observed temperatures on a five-year average basis. The BC bottom temperature record showed a significant increasing trend of 1.5{\^{A}}°C /100 yr during the twentieth century, which was never apparent in nineteenth century. That result suggests that our Mg/Ca-based thermometry approach using coastal benthic foraminifera can detect abnormally rising temperatures in neritic coastal seas in southwest Japan. The abnormal warming of winter to late spring bottom temperature in the BC contrasts with the lack of an increasing trend in the Globigerinoides ruber-based summer to autumn temperature for the upper 20 m in the slope region of southwest Japan and the lack of an increasing trend in the steric sea level in the region. These results indicate a warming trend of the neritic coastal ocean in southwest Japan, especially in winter to late spring. The timing of the onset of the prolonged abnormal high-temperature stage, which started in the early twentieth century, suggests a link of the neritic coastal ocean in Japan with human-induced global warming.},

abstract = {As archives of past climate variability, the micron and sub-micron scales of element:calcium (Me/Ca) variability in both biogenic and inorganic carbonates contain important geochemical information. Ideally working at smaller and smaller scales leads to higher temporal resolution of past changes, but more often it has revealed the strong overprint of other processes on the climate signal. Therefore, the role of SIMS and NanoSIMS techniques in studying paleoenvironmental proxies continues to increase. We evaluate the accuracy and precision of the CAMECA ims 7F-GEO and NanoSIMS-50L ion probes for measurements of Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca, and Ba/Ca ratios in carbonate minerals. Nine carbonate reference materials were examined for their 88Sr/42Ca, 24Mg/42Ca, and 138Ba/42Ca ratios using a primary O- beam with spot sizes of 20-40??m (SIMS) and 0.8-2??m (NanoSIMS). To assess accuracy, seven of these standards were analyzed for Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca with ID-ICP-MS. Variability in the elemental ratios arising from drift and changes in the tuning of the ims 7F-GEO over a nine month period is smaller than the chemical heterogeneity of the most frequently analyzed standards (OKA and Blue-CC). Across a whole crystal, Blue-CC is more homogeneous (1?? of 2.39{\%} and 1.60{\%} for Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca respectively) than OKA, but in the bulk matrix of OKA there is even less variability (1?? of 0.85{\%} and 0.83{\%} respectively). We find that carbonate samples can be accurately normalized to carbonate standards with significantly different absolute Me/Ca ratios. NanoSIMS intensity ratios follow counting statistics better than ??1{\%} (2??) at any one spot, but conversion to Me/Ca ratios increases the uncertainty. Two factors give rise to this limitation. First, the spatial heterogeneity of nominally homogeneous standards can lead to accuracy offsets that are as large as the ranges quoted above. Second, the NanoSIMS generates higher instrumental mass fractionation relative to SIMS. The combination of three different analytical techniques demonstrates that Blue-CC and homogeneous calcite zones in OKA are promising reference materials for precise analyses. Accuracy is crucially dependent on making independent measurements on exactly the same crystal of standard used in the SIMS and NanoSIMS machines. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Here we use the Earth system model GENIE-1 to simulate and compare directly past and present environmental changes in the marine realm. In our simulation of future ocean conditions, we find an undersaturation with respect to carbonate in the deep ocean that exceeds that experienced during the Palaeocene–Eocene thermal maximum and could endanger calcifying organisms. Furthermore, our simulations show higher rates of environmental change at the surface for the future than the Palaeocene–Eocene thermal maximum, which could potentially challenge the ability of plankton to adapt.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals associate with a diverse array of eukaryotic and noneukaryotic microbes. Best known are dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium ("zooxanthellae"), which are photosynthetic symbionts found in all reef-building corals. Once considered a single species, they are now recognized as several large, genetically diverse groups that often co-occur within a single host species or colony. Variation among Symbiodinium in host identities, tolerance to stress, and ability to colonize hosts has been documented, but there is little information on the ecology of zooxanthellar free-living stages and how different zooxanthellae perform as partners. Other microbial associates of reef corals are much less well known, but studies indicate that individual coral colonies host diverse assemblages of bacteria, some of which seem to have species-specific associations. This diversity of microbial associates has important evolutionary and ecological implications. Most mutualisms evolve as balanced reciprocations that allow partners to detect cheaters, particularly when partners are potentially diverse and can be transmitted horizontally. Thus, environmental stresses that incapacitate the ability of partners to reciprocate can destabilize associations by eliciting rejection by their hosts. Coral bleaching (the loss of zooxanthellae) and coral diseases, both increasing over the last several decades, may be examples of stress-related mutualistic instability.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the effects of environmental changes (ocean acidification and increased temperature) on Thecosomata pteropods. Pteropods are zooplanktonic organisms, which play a critical role as a food ressource in various ecosystems. Several physiological parameters such as calcification, respiration, excretion, gut clearance and larval development were measured on Arctic (L. helicina) and Mediterranean pteropods (C. acicula, C. inflexa) maintained under laboratory conditions mimicking the future ocean. Their gut clearance rate is unaffected by lower pH. Respiration of L. helicina is unaffected by pH at 0°C (control temperature) but increases significantly at lower pH at 4°C. In contrast, respiration of C. acicula is not affected by the pH and only decreases significantly at lower aragonite saturation sate (!a). The main outcome of the experiments is that the three species exhibit a strong decrease in calcification as a function of decreasing aragonite saturation state. Even if they are able to precipitate calcium carbonate in slightly undersaturated conditions, they will probably not be able to achieve a positive balance between gross precipitation and dissolution of CaCO3 as shown by the dissolution rates measurements on C. acicula and by the fact that larvae of C. inflexa were not able to make a shell in aragonite undersaturated conditions. These results confirm the concerns on the future of pteropods and particularly on high latitudes species. A decline of this key organism could cause dramatic changes in various ecosystems and biogeochemical fluxes.},

abstract = {The boron isotopic composition of calcium carbonate skeletons is a promising proxy method for reconstructing paleo-ocean pH and atmospheric CO2 from the geological record. Although the boron isotope methodology has been used extensively over the past two decades to determine ancient ocean-pH, the actual value of the boron isotope fractionation factor ($\epsilon$B) between the two main dissolved boron species, 11B(OH)3 and 10B(OH)-4, has remained uncertain. Initially, $\epsilon$B values were theoretically computed from vibrational frequencies of boron species, resulting in a value of {\~{}}19‰. Later, spectrophotometric pH measurements on artificial seawater suggested a higher value of {\~{}}27‰. A few independent theoretical models also pointed to a higher $\epsilon$B value. Here we provide, for the first time, an independent empirical fractionation factor ($\epsilon$B=26.0±1.0‰25 °C), determined by direct measurements of B(OH)3 in seawater and other solutions. Boric acid was isolated by preferential passage through a reverse osmosis membrane under controlled pH conditions. We further demonstrate that applying the Pitzer ion-interaction approach, combined with ion-pairing calculations, results in a more accurate determination of species distribution in aquatic solutions of different chemical composition, relative to the traditional two-species boron-system approach. We show that using the revised approach reduces both the error in simulating ancient atmospheric CO2 (by up to 21{\%}) and the overall uncertainty of applying boron isotopes for paleo-pH reconstruction. Combined, this revised methodology lays the foundation for a more accurate determination of ocean paleo-pH through time.},

abstract = {The jeju, Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus, is equipped with a modified part of the swim bladder that allows aerial respiration. On this background, we have evaluated its respiratory and cardiovascular responses to aquatic hypoxia. Its aquatic O 2 uptake (V?? O2) was maintained constant down to a critical P O2 (P cO2) of 40 mm Hg, below which V?? O2 declined linearly with further reductions of P iO2. Just below P cO2, the ventilatory tidal volume (V T) increased significantly along with gill ventilation (V?? G), while respiratory frequency changed little. Consequently, water convection requirement (V?? G/V?? O2) increased steeply. The same threshold applied to cardiovascular responses that included reflex bradycardia and elevated arterial blood pressure (P a). Aerial respiration was initiated at water P O2 of 44 mm Hg and breathing episodes and time at the surface increased linearly with more severe hypoxia. At the lowest water P O2 (20 mm Hg), the time spent at the surface accounted for 50{\%} of total time. This response has a character of a temporary emergency behavior that may allow the animal to escape hypoxia. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The choice of a new nest site is ecologically critical for an insect colony. In swarm-founding social insects, or those that move as colonies from one site to another, this choice is one of the best- available examples of a distributed, nonhierarchical decision-making process in animals. In the few species of ants and bees that have been studied in detail, the main features of this collective decision making are strikingly similar, although some differences occur. Individual scouts discover potential nest sites and integrate multiple properties of these sites into assessments of their quality. The discovered sites then compete for a limited pool of nest-site scouts, and attrition of less-favored sites occurs by several mechanisms. Finally, the mass movement of the colony to the new site is triggered by a quorum- sensing mechanism when sufficient scouts are present at one of the alternatives.Movementitself is coordinated by different mechanisms in different insects.},

abstract = {This paper presents a life history model for a perennial social insect colony. The model's purpose is to explore the evolutionary consequences, in terms of fitness of different parties within the colony, of alternative life history strategies. The model has been specifically developed for colonies of the slave-making ant, Harpagoxenus sublaevis, which has reproductive workers organized in dominance orders. It incorporates empirically obtained parameters, and uses computer algorithms based on numerical optimization to determine the optimum policy for a colony queen in allocating resources between workers, queens and males. Variants of the model also consider alternative situations in which either (1) orphaned workers do not slave-raid, or (2) workers are sterile. The results correspond closely to data on colony growth and reproductive allocation obtained from the field. They suggest that a colony queen would suffer reduced fitness in the two theoretical cases as compared to the real situation. Reproduction by orphaned workers posthumously enhances the colony queen's fitness because a queen with sterile workers cannot produce enough extra sexuals in her lifetime to balance her loss in grandson production. The results also suggest that the division of labour between slave-raiding and nonraiding workers observed in H. sublaevis colonies can be explained as an outcome of worker-worker reproductive conflict: reproductively-inhibited subordinate workers can increase their inclusive fitness by slave-raiding for dominant, nonraiding egg-layers. These findings emphasize the evolutionary importance of the orphanage period and of intracolony conflict in monogynous social insect colonies.},

abstract = {For a series of different proteins, including a structural protein, enzyme, inhibitor, protein marker, and a charge-transfer system, we have quantified the higher affinity of Na+ over K+ to the protein surface by means of molecular dynamics simulations and conductivity measurements. Both approaches show that sodium binds at least twice as strongly to the protein surface than potassium does with this effect being present in all proteins under study. Different parts of the protein exterior are responsible to a varying degree for the higher surface affinity of sodium, with the charged carboxylic groups of aspartate and glutamate playing the most important role. Therefore, local ion pairing is the key to the surface preference of sodium over potassium, which is further demonstrated and quantified by simulations of glutamate and aspartate in the form of isolated amino acids as well as short oligopeptides. As a matter of fact, the effect is already present at the level of preferential pairing of the smallest carboxylate anions, formate or acetate, with Na+ versus K+, as shown by molecular dynamics and ab initio quantum chemical calculations. By quantifying and rationalizing the higher preference of sodium over potassium to protein surfaces, the present study opens a way to molecular understanding of many ion-specific (Hofmeister) phenomena involving protein interactions in salt solutions.},

abstract = {IN 1978 Mercer(1) discussed the probable effects of climate warming on the Antarctic Ice Sheet, predicting that one sign of a warming trend in this region would be the retreat of ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula. Analyses of 50-year meteorological records have since revealed atmospheric warming on the Antarctic Peninsula(2,3), and a number of ice shelves have retreated(4-8). Here we present time-series of observations of the areal extent of nine ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula, showing that five northerly ones have retreated dramatically in the past fifty years, while those further south show no clear trend. Comparison with air-temperature data shows that the pattern and magnitude of ice-shelf retreat is consistent with the existence of an abrupt thermal limit on ice-shelf viability, the isotherm associated with this limit having been driven south by the atmospheric warming. Ice shelves therefore appear to be sensitive indicators of climate change.},

abstract = {Periods of globally distributed extreme oxygen depletion, so-called oceanic anoxic events (OAEs), have been recognized in the Mesozoic geological record and appear to be characteristic of episodes of extreme warmth. Here we explore the application of iodine/calcium ratios (I/Ca) in marine carbonate as a new geochemical proxy to constrain seawater redox change, and provide additional insights into the response of ocean chemistry to ancient climatic warming. Iodine has long been known as a redox-sensitive and biophilic element, mainly present as iodate and iodide in seawater, iodate converting to iodide under anoxic conditions. Laboratory experiments growing calcite crystals from solutions spiked with iodate show that this is the ionic species incorporated into the carbonate structure, likely substituting for the CO32− ion. A fall in the I/Ca ratio measured in carbonates formed in shallow water by marine calcifiers during the early Toarcian and Cenomanian-Turonian OAEs is interpreted both as a response to a decrease in the iodate/iodide ratio in ocean waters and the drawdown of the global iodine inventory under conditions of accelerated organic-matter burial. The results suggest that I/Ca ratios in carbonates may be used to monitor seawater oxidation levels throughout Earth history.},

abstract = {While a few North Atlantic cod stocks are stable, none have increased and many have declined in recent years. Although overfishing is the main cause of most observed declines, this study shows that in some regions, climate by its influence on plankton may exert a strong control on cod stocks, complicating the management of this species that often assumes a constant carrying capacity. First, we investigate the likely drivers of changes in the cod stock in the North Sea by evaluating the potential relationships between climate, plankton and cod. We do this by deriving a Plankton Index that reflects the quality and quantity of plankton food available for larval cod. We show that this Plankton Index explains 46.24{\%} of the total variance in cod recruitment and 68.89{\%} of the variance in total cod biomass. Because the effects of climate act predominantly through plankton during the larval stage of cod development, our results indicate a pronounced sensitivity of cod stocks to climate at the warmer, southern edge of their distribution, for example in the North Sea. Our analyses also reveal for the first time, that at a large basin scale, the abundance of Calanus finmarchicus is associated with a high probability of cod occurrence, whereas the genus Pseudocalanus appears less important. Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) generally considers the effect of fishing on the ecosystem and not the effect of climate-induced changes in the ecosystem state for the living resources. These results suggest that EBFM must consider the position of a stock within its ecological niche, the direct effects of climate and the influence of climate on the trophodynamics of the ecosystem.},

abstract = {Boron is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and the boron content of plants differs greatly, but the mechanism(s) of its uptake into cells is not known. Boron is present in the soil solution as boric acid and it is in this form that it enters the roots. We determined the boron permeability coefficient of purified plasma membrane vesicles obtained from squash (Cucurbita pepo) roots and found it to be 3 x 10(-7) +/-1.4 x 10(-8) cm s(-1), six times higher than the permeability of microsomal vesicles. Boric acid permeation of the plasma membrane vesicles was partially inhibited (30{\%}-39{\%}) by mercuric chloride and phloretin, a non-specific channel blocker. The inhibition by mercuric chloride was readily reversible by 2-mercaptoethanol. The energy of activation for boron transport into the plasma membrane vesicles was 10.2 kcal mol(-1). Together these data indicate that boron enters plant cells in part by passive diffusion through the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane and in part through proteinaceous channels. Expression of the major intrinsic protein (MIP) PIP1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes resulted in a 30{\%} increase in the boron permeability of the oocytes. Other MIPs tested (PIP3, MLM1, and GlpF) did not have this effect. We postulate that certain MIPs, like those that have recently been shown to transport small neutral solutes, may also be the channels through which boron enters plant cells.},

Among the three Umbellosphaera tenuis morphotypes observed in this study (Types I, III, and IV), only Type I was found in very warm tropical surface. Both Types III and IV were found in subtropical waters, and Type III differed from Type IV in that its distribution was constrained to hemi-pelagic waters. Habitat segregation among the morphotypes of major taxa indicates that the observed global distributions of these major taxa are, in fact, combinations of discrete morphological groups. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The reaction rate and composition of calcite and aragonite overgrowths precipitated from seawater solutions of various salinities (i.e. S=5, 15, 25, 35, 44) were determined at 25??C and 10-2.5-atm. CO2 partial pressure using a constant disequilibrium seeded technique. The rate data were fitted to an empirical rate law of the form: logR=n(??c(or a)-1)+logk. where n is the empirical reaction order; and k is the rate constant. Calcite precipitation rates in seawater solutions do not vary appreciably as a result of salinity variations over the range investigated, while those for aragonite show an increase in going from the higher (i.e. S=35, 44) to the lower (i.e. S=5, 15, 25) salinity range. This study also confirms previously published findings that above a given saturation state (i.e. ??c{\textgreater}/2.6) aragonite precipitates more rapidly than calcite at 25??C. The incorporation of Sr2+ in aragonite and Mg2+ in calcite overgrowths are independent of the precipitation rate. The partition coefficient of Sr2+ in aragonite is approximately equal to unity and is unaffected by salinity variations between 5 and 44. However, the Mg2+ partition coefficient in calcite, increases with decreasing salinity of the parent seawater solutions, possibly as a result of variations in the sulfate content of the solutions and solids. The experimental results were discussed in the context of a number of geological environments. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Swarm raiding army ants, with hundreds of thousands or millions of workers per colony, have evolved convergently in the Old World and New World tropics. Here we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, superefficient foraging teams in Old World army ants and we compare them quantitatively with such teams in New World army ants. Colonies of Dorylus wilverthi in the Old World and Eciton burchelli in the New World retrieve almost identical sizes of prey item and the overall size range of their workers is very similar. However, 98{\%} of D. wilverthi workers are within the size range of the smallest 25{\%} of E. burchelli workers. In E. burchelli larger workers specialize in prey retrieval, whereas in D. wilverthi workers form many more teams than in E. burchelli. Such teams compensate for the relative rarity of larger workers in Dorylus. The proportions of prey items retrieved by teams in Dorylus and Eciton are 39{\%} and 5{\%}, respectively. The percentages of all prey biomass retrieved by teams in Dorylus and Eciton are 64{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively. Working either as single porters or teams, Dorylus carry more per unit ant weight than do Eciton, but Eciton are swifter. However, these different ergonomic factors counterbalance one another, so that performance at the colony level is remarkably, although by no means completely, similar between the Old and New World species. The remaining differences are attributable to adaptations in worker and colony tempo associated with the recovery dynamics of their prey populations. Our comparative analysis provides a unique perspective on worker-level and colony-level adaptations and is a special test of the theory of worker caste distributions.},

abstract = {Accurate records of the state of the ocean carbonate system are critical for understanding past changes in pCO2, ocean acidification and climate. The chemical principles underlying the proxy of oceanic pH provided by the boron isotope ratio of foraminiferal carbonate are relatively well understood, but the proxy's reliability has been questioned. We present 76 new Multi-Collector Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) $\delta$11B measurements on a range of benthic foraminifera from 23 late-Holocene samples from the Atlantic that reaffirm the utility of the $\delta$11B-pH proxy. Our boron isotope measurements on {\~{}}10 benthic foraminifera tests typically yield a precision of {\~{}}±0.25‰ at 2 s.d. (equivalent to {\~{}}±0.03 pH units). $\delta$11B values of epifaunal species are within analytical uncertainty of those predicted from a simple model assuming sole incorporation of B(OH)4- from seawater and no vital effects, using the independently determined fractionation factor of 1.0272 between 11B/10B of aqueous boron species. Infaunal foraminifera are consistent with this model, but record the combined effects of lower pore-water $\delta$11B and pH. No influence of partial dissolution or shell size on $\delta$11B is observed. We have also measured the B/Ca ratios of the same samples. For individual Cibicidoides species, B/Ca shows a good correlation with $\delta$[CO32-], but the B/Ca of different co-occurring species morphotypes varies considerably. These effects are not seen in $\delta$11B, which may therefore provide a more robust proxy of the ocean carbonate system. Whilst in theory $\delta$11B and B/Ca can be combined to provide a quantitative reconstruction of alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbonate (DIC), in practice this is precluded by propagated uncertainties. $\delta$11B data give significant constraints on foraminifera calcification mechanisms, and seem most simply explained by incorporation of B(OH)4- into a HCO3- pool, which is then completely incorporated in foraminiferal CaCO3. Our demonstration of the predictable variation of $\delta$11B with pH, across a wide range of species and locations, provides confidence in the application of MC-ICPMS measurements of foraminiferal $\delta$11B to reconstruct past changes in the ocean carbonate system. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This Perspective describes an area of geochemistry that involves minerals, their surfaces, and the interactions of these surfaces with water and the ions and molecules present in water, some of which, like arsenic, are highly toxic to organisms. The importance of these interactions, together with those between microorganisms and mineral surfaces, cannot be overestimated, for they control the composition of our natural environment and mitigate some of the anthropogenic perturbations that are changing our environment in ways that are often unpredictable and sometimes detrimental. Following overviews of our scientific careers to date, including acknowledgments of our former and current students and research collaborators, we highlight some of the scientific contributions of Victor Goldschmidt, Irving Langmuir, Linus Pauling, Konrad Krauskopf, Werner Stumm, and others that led directly or indirectly to the evolution of this field, recalling personal interactions with some of these pioneers. In all fields of science, advances are made when new experimental methods, new characterisation and computational tools, and new theories become available. The field of mineral-water interface geochemistry is no different and has advanced significantly over the past 30–40 years due to enormous changes in molecular-level experimental methods, particularly those involving the extremely intense X-ray sources known as synchrotrons, in digital computers, and in molecular-level theories. We (GB and GC) offer our perspectives on the development of synchrotron radiation sources and their applications to mineral-water interface processes, based on our personal experiences starting in the early days of these major user facilities. We discuss some of these new methods and theories and their applications to mineral-water interface processes through various examples. Because of the complexity of mineral-water interfaces, particularly in natural Earth surface environments, where natural organic matter and microorganisms play very important roles, we adopt a reductionist approach and consider simple model systems of increasing complexity in our quest to understand the chemical processes occurring at these interfaces at the molecular level. We start with a discussion of the acid-base chemistry of metal-oxide surfaces in contact with bulk water and empirical models of the electrical double layer (EDL) that is thought to develop at solid-water interfaces. We then consider experimental and theoretical studies of the EDL, which show that the classical Helmholtz-Gouy-Chapman-Stern-Grahame model is qualitatively correct. Following a story about some of the new, controversial research on the structure of water, we discuss (1) experimental and theoretical studies of the reaction of water with metal-oxide surfaces, (2) the structure of hydrated mineral surfaces, (3) the uptake of cations and anions on metal-oxide surfaces, (4) X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies of lead and arsenic adsorption complexes at mineral-water interfaces, (5) the adsorption of organic molecules at mineral-water interfaces, (6) the effect of organic and microbial biofilm coatings on the reactivity of mineral surfaces, and (7) the effect of particle size on the structure and properties of nanoparticles, using ferrihydrite as an example of a natural nanomineral and silver nanoparticles as an example of an engineered nanoparticle. In keeping with the spirit of Geochemical Perspectives, we interspersed personal experiences resulting from our involvement in most of these research areas.},

abstract = {Calcite crystals were nucleated from MgCl2/CaCl2 solns. onto functionalized self-assembled monolayers adsorbed onto E-beam evapd. Au films. Synchrotron X-ray scattering studies of the crystals reveal new information about preferred orientation and Mg incorporation. The Au [111] axis is distributed within 2.6 Deg of the film surface normal, but the oriented crystals may be tilted up to 6 Deg away from this axis. For low Mg2+ content, SO3--functionalized films nucleated primarily near the (106) calcite face, odd-chain-length carboxylic acid terminated alkanethiol films nucleated near the (012) face, and even-chain-length carboxylic acid terminated alkanethiol films nucleated near the (113) face. [Mg2+]/[Ca2+] concn. ratios (n) of 2 and greater defeated this preferred orientation and created a powder texture. Diffraction patterns within the layer plane from the coarse calcite powders indicated a shift to higher 2q accompanied by peak broadening with increasing n. For 0.5 {\textless} n {\textless} 3.5, a double set of calcite peaks is obsd., showing that two distinct Mg calcite phases form: one of comparatively lower Mg content, derived from the templated crystals, and a Mg-rich phase derived from amorphous precursor particles. According to the refinement of lattice parameters, Mg incorporation of up to 18 mol {\%} occurs for n = 4, independent of film functionality. We discuss the differences between the differently functionalized monolayers and also introduce the hypothesis that two sep. routes to Mg calcite formation occur in this system. [on SciFinder (R)]},

@article{Bryan1992,
abstract = {Using mainly United Kingdom estuaries as examples, various factors governing the bioavailability, bioaccumulation and biological effects of heavy metals in sediment-dominated estuaries are reviewed.  Estuaries and metals primarily discussed include the Mersey (Hg, methylmercury; Pb, alkyllead), the Loughor (Cr, Sn), the Severn (Ag, Cd), the Fal (As, Cu, Sn, Zn), Poole Harbour (Cd, Hg, Se, tributyltin) and Southampton Water (tributyltin). Concentrations and bioavailabilities of metals in estuarine sediments depend on many different processes.  Examples include (1) mobilisation of metals to the interstitial water and their chemical speciation, (2) transformation (e.g. methylation) of metals including As, Hg, Pb and Sn, (3) the control exerted by major sediment components (e.g. oxides of Fe and organics) to which metals are preferentially bound, (4) competition between sediment metals (e.g. Cu and Ag; Zn and Cd) for uptake sites in organisms, and (5) the influence of bioturbation, salinity, redox or pH on these processes. Under field conditions, identification of dominant processes can be achieved by observing the goodness of fit between metal concentrations in ubiquitous deposit-feeding species and levels in various types of sediment extract over a wide spectrum of sediment types.  Factors of more local importance are often indicated by the marked deviation of some points from otherwise excellent relationships.  For example, points lying above the line relating tissue Sn concentrations in the clam Scrobicularia plana to those in 1 N HCl extracts of sediments were found to reflect the accumulation of tributyltin, a more readily bioavailable form of Sn.  In the same species, unexpectedly high tissue-Cu concentrations were characteristic of very anoxic sediments and tissue As and Pb concentrations were suppressed in sediments having high concentrations of Fe oxides. Under field conditions, examples of deleterious effects on benthic organisms that can be attributed to specific metallic pollutants are comparatively rare.  Effects of tributyltins from antifouling paints on oysters and neogastropods have been documented and their toxicity has undoubtedly led to environmental degradation in many UK estuaries and coastal areas.  In estuaries contaminated with metal-mining wastes, the effects of Cu and Zn on species distribution can be observed, but they are generally less obvious than would be predicted from experimental data.  Effects are ameliorated by the induction of metal tolerance mechanisms in some species and in others by the appearance of tolerant strains.  The induction of metal detoxification systems involving the formation of granules or metal-binding proteins leads in some species to tissue concentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than normal.  For example, high concentrations of Cd and Ag have been found in some species from the Severn Estuary, although there is no unequivocal evidence that either metal has caused deleterious effects on benthic populations.  On the other hand, experimental studies with Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg and Zn show that they are toxic to some species at environmentally realistic levels.  Since pollutants rarely occur singly, it is likely that in many moderately contaminated estuaries metals contribute to the stress to organisms caused by substances requiring detoxification.  There has been much speculation over the years concerning the biomagnification of metals with increasing trophic levels along food chains.  Whilst animals having higher metal concentrations than their prey are sometimes found, the only consistent evidence of biomagnification concerns methylmercury. When estuarine birds are considered, there are relatively few instances in which deleterious effects can unequivocally be attributed to metals or their compounds.  However, the Mersey bird kill was attributable to alkyllead pollution from industry.  Among other organometals, methylmercury has proved toxic to birds but, so far, no evidence for the toxicity of tributyltin has been reported.  However, the compound may have affected bird populations through its effects on the abundance of prey organisms, particularly estuarine molluscs.  Of the inorganic forms of metals, Pb in the form of shot has caused problems in many areas and Cd, Hg and Se are suspected of causing toxic effects.  There is little field evidence that birds have been affected by Ag, As, Cr, Cu or Zn individually.  On the other hand, it is difficult to exclude the possibility that, additively, these metals may produce a significant effect.  In part, the lack of evidence reflects the fact that relatively little research has been done.  There is scope for more work on metals and organometals in estuarine birds, particularly with regard to their metabolism and their effects on juveniles and individuals subjected to stresses such as starvation.},

The Ostwald step rule, based on a thermodynamic view of nucleation and growth, is supported by the observation that more metastable phases tend to have lower surface energies.

abstract = {Benthic oxygen and carbon isotopic results from a depth transect on Maud Rise, Antarctica, provide the first evidence for Warm Saline Deep Water (WSDW) in the Paleogene oceans. Isotopic reversals, well developed by at least 46Ma (middle middle Eocene), existed for much of the remaining Paleogene. We do not consider these reversals to be artifacts of differential diagenesis between the two sites or to have resulted from other potentially complicating factors. A progressive decrease and eventual reversal in benthic to planktonic {\^{I}}´18O gradients in Hole 690B, demonstrate that the deeper waters became warmer relative to Antarctic surface waters during the Eocene. The warmer deep waters of the Paleogene are inferred to have been produced at middle to low latitudes, probably in the Tethyan region which contained extensive shallow-water platforms, ideal sites for the formation of high salinity water through evaporative processes. The ocean during the Eocene, and perhaps the Paleocene, is inferred to have been two-layered, consisting of warm, saline deep waters formed at low latitudes and overlain by cooler waters formed at high latitudes. This thermospheric ocean, dominated by halothermal circulation we name Proteus. The Neogene and modern psychrospheric ocean Oceanus is dominated by thermohaline circulation of deep waters largely formed at high latitudes. An intermediate condition existed during the Oligocene, with a three-layered ocean that consisted of cold, dense deep waters formed in the Antarctic (Proto-AABW), overlain by warm, saline deep waters from low latitudes, and in turn overlain by cool waters formed in the polar regions. This we name Proto-oceanus which combined both halothermal and thermohaline processes. -from Authors},

Many processes intrinsic to the dynamics of the spreading center volcanic system provide partial or complete nutritionalfluxes that support diverse microbial communities that thrive under extreme conditions on and beneath the seafloor. Mantle melting, volcanism, and fluid- rock reactions transport volatiles from the asthenosphere to the hydrosphere. Volcanic heat and exothermic reactions drive circulation of nutrient-rich fluids from which chemosynthetic organisms gain metabolic energy. In turn, many of these organisms symbiotically support macrofaunal communities that populate the vents. Long-term seafloor observatories will allow exploration of linkages between volcanism and this newly discovered biosphere. Such approaches may provide essential new information about our own planet while providing critically needed insights into howwe can explore other planets for life.},

abstract = {The ratio of magnesium to calcium (Mg/Ca) in CaCO3 shells of foraminifera is widely used to determine paleotemperatures. However, Mg/Ca is highly variable within and between species, suggesting a strong physiological influence on the incorporation of Mg2+ into the shells. While most field and laboratory calibrations have focused on the effect of temperature, we chose to study the effect of ambient Mg/Ca on the calcification process and the final shell composition. We cultured two species of symbiont-bearing benthic foraminifera, Amphistegina lobifera and Amphistegina lessonii, in seawater with different Mg/Ca ratios. Electron probe analysis of the shell Mg/Ca revealed a positive (but not entirely linear) correlation with Mg/Ca in the culturing media with slightly different curves for each species. Partition coefficients of Mg2+ (DMg) in the calcite shells showed a decrease by a factor of roughly 2 between the lowest and highest Mg/Ca in the ambient water. This was previously demonstrated in inorganic calcite precipitation experiments. However, the biogenic DMg was significantly lower than the inorganic one, suggesting a physiological mechanism that reduces Mg/Ca at the calcification site. Unlike inorganic experiments that display a dependence of DMg on the kinetics of precipitation, the biogenic DMg is not correlated with the rate of calcification. Both DMg and calcification rates in our experiment were sensitive to the Mg/Ca ratio rather than the concentration of either Ca2+ or Mg2+. The largest addition of CaCO3 was obtained at Mg/Ca of 1, and not at present-day seawater ratio (Mg/Ca = 5). This may reflect the Mg/Ca that prevailed during the Eocene (Mg/Ca {\&}{\#}8764; 1.5), when this genus evolved.},

abstract = {The majority of invertebrate skeletal tissues are composed of the most stable crystalline polymorphs of CaCO(3), calcite, and/or aragonite. Here we describe a composite skeletal tissue from an ascidian in which amorphous and crystalline calcium carbonate coexist in well-defined domains separated by an organic sheath. Each biogenic mineral phase has a characteristic Mg content (5.9 and 1.7 mol {\%}, respectively) and concentration of intramineral proteins (0.05 and 0.01 wt {\%}, respectively). Macromolecular extracts from various biogenic amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) skeletons are typically glycoproteins, rich in glutamic acid and hydroxyamino acids. The proteins from the crystalline calcitic phases are aspartate-rich. Macromolecules extracted from biogenic ACC induced the formation of stabilized ACC and/or inhibited crystallization of calcite in vitro. The yield of the synthetic ACC was 15-20{\%}. The presence of Mg facilitated the stabilization of ACC: the protein content in synthetic ACC was 0.12 wt {\%} in the absence of Mg and 0.07 wt {\%} in the presence of Mg (the Mg content in the precipitate was 8.5 mol {\%}). In contrast, the macromolecules extracted from the calcitic layer induced the formation of calcite crystals with modified morphology similar to that expressed by the original biogenic calcite. We suggest that specialized macromolecules and magnesium ions may cooperate in the stabilization of intrinsically unstable amorphous calcium carbonate and in the formation of complex ACC/calcite tissues in vivo.},

abstract = {Contributing roughly half of the biosphere's net primary production (NPP), photosynthesis by oceanic phytoplankton is a vital link in the cycling of carbon between living and inorganic stocks. Each day, more than a hundred million tons of carbon in the form of CO2 are fixed into organic material by these ubiquitous, microscopic plants of the upper ocean, and each day a similar amount of organic carbon is transferred into marine ecosystems by sinking and grazing. The distribution of phytoplankton biomass and NPP is defined by the availability of light and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphate, iron). These growth-limiting factors are in turn regulated by physical processes of ocean circulation, mixed-layer dynamics, upwelling, atmospheric dust deposition, and the solar cycle. Satellite measurements of ocean colour provide a means of quantifying ocean productivity on a global scale and linking its variability to environmental factors. Here we describe global ocean NPP changes detected from space over the past decade. The period is dominated by an initial increase in NPP of 1,930 teragrams of carbon a year (Tg C yr(-1)), followed by a prolonged decrease averaging 190 Tg C yr(-1). These trends are driven by changes occurring in the expansive stratified low-latitude oceans and are tightly coupled to coincident climate variability. This link between the physical environment and ocean biology functions through changes in upper-ocean temperature and stratification, which influence the availability of nutrients for phytoplankton growth. The observed reductions in ocean productivity during the recent post-1999 warming period provide insight on how future climate change can alter marine food webs.},

abstract = {To decide whether a physiological role can be attributed to enzymatic activity with respect to crystal formation and biomineralization of the first larval shell, carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity was measured in embryos and larvae of the blue mussels Mytilus edulis L. Also, CA activity was determined in the mantle edge and gonads of adult mussels with different shell length and condition index. The intention was to find a possible correlation between CA activity and adult shell calcification, i.e. gonadal maturation. The comparison of CA activity in different developmental stages of mussels and the results of an X-ray diffraction study of biomineralization processes in embryonic and larval shells indicate that: CA activity is maximal at the end of several developmental stages. Consequently, the increase in CA activity precedes some physiological changes, i.e. the somatoblast 2d formation and the occurrence of the first calcite and quartz crystals in embryos, shell field formation in the gastrula stage, shell gland and periostracum production in trochophores, and rapid aragonite deposition in larval prodissoconch I and prodissoconch II shells. Furthermore, it was found that in adult mussels CA activity was quite variable and that in the mantle edge it was frequently inversely related to the activity in the gonad.},

abstract = {Human activities are releasing gigatonnes of carbon to the Earth's atmosphere annually. Direct consequences of cumulative post-industrial emissions include increasing global temperature, perturbed regional weather patterns, rising sea levels, acidifying oceans, changed nutrient loads and altered ocean circulation. These and other physical consequences are affecting marine biological processes from genes to ecosystems, over scales from rock pools to ocean basins, impacting ecosystem services and threatening human food security. The rates of physical change are unprecedented in some cases. Biological change is likely to be commensurately quick, although the resistance and resilience of organisms and ecosystems is highly variable. Biological changes founded in physiological response manifest as species range-changes, invasions and extinctions, and ecosystem regime shifts. Given the essential roles that oceans play in planetary function and provision of human sustenance, the grand challenge is to intervene before more tipping points are passed and marine ecosystems follow less-buffered terrestrial systems further down a spiral of decline. Although ocean bioengineering may alleviate change, this is not without risk. The principal brake to climate change remains reduced CO2 emissions that marine scientists and custodians of the marine environment can lobby for and contribute to. This review describes present-day climate change, setting it in context with historical change, considers consequences of climate change for marine biological processes now and in to the future, and discusses contributions that marine systems could play in mitigating the impacts of global climate change. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The same measurements in the presence of different electrolytes NaCl, Na2SO4, and CaCl2 for ionic surfactants (SDBS and CTAB) were also carried out to see the change in contact angle and wetting behavior. The presence of electrolytes changes the advancing contact angle as well as wetting properties of hydrophobic solid surface significantly even at very low surfactant concentration. Counter ion valency of the electrolyte is more important in reducing advancing contact angle on hydrophobic PTFE surface at very low concentration of ionic surfactants from CMC.

abstract = {The Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets cover {\~{}} 10{\%} of global land surface, but are rarely considered as active components of the global iron cycle. The ocean waters around both ice sheets harbour highly productive coastal ecosystems, many of which are iron limited. Measurements of iron concentrations in subglacial runoff from a large Greenland Ice Sheet catchment reveal the potential for globally significant export of labile iron fractions to the near-coastal euphotic zone. We estimate that the flux of bioavailable iron associated with glacial runoff is 0.40-2.54 Tg per year in Greenland and 0.06-0.17 Tg per year in Antarctica. Iron fluxes are dominated by a highly reactive and potentially bioavailable nanoparticulate suspended sediment fraction, similar to that identified in Antarctic icebergs. Estimates of labile iron fluxes in meltwater are comparable with aeolian dust fluxes to the oceans surrounding Greenland and Antarctica, and are similarly expected to increase in a warming climate with enhanced melting.},

abstract = {Four types of oscillatory zoning patterns (OZP) produced by a dynamic model are described qualitatively and quantitatively and displayed as simulated cathodoluminescence images. The behavior of the dynamic model was investigated in terms of the parameter $\theta$, which is the ratio of diffusivities of Ca2+ and H2CO3, and in terms of the parameter $\gamma$, which is the product of $\theta$ and the ratio of concentrations of Ca2+ and H2 CO3 far away from the crystal surface. Qualitatively, the dynamics of the model has been characterized by a stable focus, an unstable focus changing to a stable node or to a stable limit cycle, and by periodical behavior with constant amplitude. Quantitative characteristics, including amplitude of oscillations and duration of oscillations, change between the patterns. It is shown that the process of forming oscillatory zoning in calcite with conditions corresponding to periodical behavior with constant amplitude is very slow in comparison to other OZPs. The oscillatory zoning pattern in a natural calcite crystal is described qualitatively in terms of four general OZPs produced by the dynamic model. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

abstract = {The size and metabolic rate of cells affect processes from the molecular to the organismal level. We present a quantitative, theoretical framework for studying relationships among cell volume, cellular metabolic rate, body size, and whole-organism metabolic rate that helps reveal the feedback between these levels of organization. We use this framework to show that average cell volume and average cellular metabolic rate cannot both remain constant with changes in body size because of the well known body-size dependence of whole-organism metabolic rate. Based on empirical data compiled for 18 cell types in mammals, we find that many cell types, including erythrocytes, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, follow a strategy in which cellular metabolic rate is body size dependent and cell volume is body size invariant. We suggest that this scaling holds for all quickly dividing cells, and conversely, that slowly dividing cells are expected to follow a strategy in which cell volume is body size dependent and cellular metabolic rate is roughly invariant with body size. Data for slowly dividing neurons and adipocytes show that cell volume does indeed scale with body size. From these results, we argue that the particular strategy followed depends on the structural and functional properties of the cell type. We also discuss consequences of these two strategies for cell number and capillary densities. Our results and conceptual framework emphasize fundamental constraints that link the structure and function of cells to that of whole organisms.},

abstract = {The boron isotope-pH technique is founded on a theoretical model of carbonate $\delta$11B variation with pH that assumes that the boron isotopic composition of carbonates mirrors the boron isotopic composition of borate in solution ($\delta$11Bcarb = $\delta$11Bborate). Knowledge of the fractionation factor for isotope exchange between boric acid and borate in solution ($\alpha$4-3), the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of boric acid (pKB*), as well as the isotopic composition of boron in seawater ($\delta$11Bsw) are required parameters of the model. The available data suggests that both the value of $\alpha$4-3 and the history of $\delta$11Bsw are poorly constrained. However, if one assumes that $\delta$11Bcarb = $\delta$11Bborate, an empirical value for $\alpha$4-3 can be estimated from the results of inorganic carbonate precipitation experiments. This exercise yields an $\alpha$4-3 value of ∼0.974 in accordance with recent theoretical estimates, but substantially deviates from the theoretical value of 0.981 often used to estimate paleo-ocean pH. Re-evaluation of ocean pH using an $\alpha$4-3 value of 0.974 and published foraminiferal $\delta$11B values for the Cenozoic yield pH estimates that are relatively invariant, but unrealistically high (∼8.4-8.6). Uncertainty increases as foraminiferal 'vital effects' are considered and different models for secular changes in seawater $\delta$11B are applied. The inability to capture realistic ocean pH possibly reflects on our understanding of the isotopic relationship between carbonate and borate, as well as the mechanism of boron incorporation in carbonates. Given the current understanding of boron systematics, pH values estimated using this technique have considerable uncertainty, particularly when reconstructions exceed the residence time of boron in the ocean.

CASSection: Surface Chemistry and Colloids Abstract Abstract Image  Oxide-supported metal nanoparticles are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis. The increasingly detailed design of such catalysts necessitates three-dimensional characterization with high spatial resolution and elemental selectivity. Laser-assisted atom probe tomography (APT) is uniquely suited to the task but faces challenges with the evaporation of metal/insulator systems. Correlation of APT with aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), for Au nanoparticles embedded in MgO, reveals preferential evaporation of the MgO and an inaccurate assessment of nanoparticle composition. Finite element field evaporation modeling is used to illustrate the evolution of the evaporation front. Nanoparticle composition is most accurately predicted when the MgO is treated as having a locally variable evaporation field, indicating the importance of considering laser–oxide interactions and the evaporation of various molecular oxide ions. These results demonstrate the viability of APT for analysis of oxide-supported metal nanoparticles, highlighting the need for developing a theoretical framework for the evaporation of heterogeneous materials.

abstract = {Marine organisms must possess strategies enabling them to initiate calcite precipitation despite the unfavorable conditions for inorganic precipitation in surface seawater. These strategies are poorly understood. Here we compare two potential strategies of marine calcifyers to manipulate seawater chemistry in order to initiate calcite precipitation: Removal of Mg2+ and H+ ions from seawater solutions. An experimental setup was used to monitor the onset of inorganic precipitation on seed crystals as a function of the Mg2+ concentration and pH in artificial seawater. We focused on precipitation rates typical for biogenic calcification in planktonic foraminifera ({\~{}}10-3 mol m-2 h-1) and time scales typical for the initiation of calcification in these organisms (minutes to hours). We find that the carbonate ion concentration has to increase by a factor of {\~{}}13 when [Mg2+] increases from 0 to 53 mmol kg-1 in order to maintain a typical biogenic precipitation rate. Model calculations for the energy requirement for various scenarios of Mg2+ and H+ removal including Ca2+ exchange and CO2 diffusion are presented. We conclude that the more cost-effective strategy to initiate calcite precipitation in foraminifera is H+ removal, rather than Mg2+ removal. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

A sudden jump to contact then occurs over less than 1 nanometer, followed by lateral atom-by-atom addition initiated at the contact point. Interface elimination proceeds at a rate consistent with the curvature dependence of the Gibbs free energy.

abstract = {This paper reviews the present status of the Pitzer chemical equilibrium model, which can be used to characterize the one-atmosphere activity coefficients of ionic and non-ionic solutes in natural waters as a function of temperature and ionic strength. The model considers the ionic interactions of the major seasalt ions (H, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Cl, Br, OH, HCO3, B(OH)4, HSO4, SO4, CO3, CO2, B(OH)3, H2O) and is based on the 25 °C model of Weare and co-workers. The model has been extended by a number of workers so that reasonable estimates can be made of the activity coefficients of most of the major seasalt ions from 0 to 250 °C. Recently coefficients for a number of solutes that are needed to determine the dissociation constants of the acids from 0 to 50 °C (H3CO3, B(OH)3, H2O, HF, HSO 4 -, H3PO4, H2S, NH 4 + etc.) have been added to the model. These results have been used to examine the carbonate system in natural waters and determine the activity of inorganic anions that can complex trace metals. The activity and osmotic coefficients determined from the model are shown to be in good agreement with measured values in seawater. This model can serve as the foundation for future expansions that can examine the activity coefficient and speciation of trace metals in natural waters. At present this is only possible from 0 to 50 °C over a limited range of ionic strengths ({\textless}1.0) due to the limited stability constants for the formation of the metal complexes. The future work needed to extend the Pitzer model to trace metals is discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The sea urchin embryo has been an important model organism in developmental biology for more than a century. This is due to its relatively simple construction, translucent appearance, and the possibility to follow the fate of individual cells as development to the pluteus larva proceeds. Because the larvae contain tiny calcitic skeletal elements, the spicules, they are also important model organisms for biomineralization research. Similar to other biominerals the spicule contains an organic matrix, which is thought to play an important role in its formation. However, only few spicule matrix proteins were identified previously.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using mass spectrometry-based methods we have identified 231 proteins in the matrix of the S. purpuratus spicule matrix. Approximately two thirds of the identified proteins are either known or predicted to be extracellular proteins or transmembrane proteins with large ectodomains. The ectodomains may have been solubilized by partial proteolysis and subsequently integrated into the growing spicule. The most abundant protein of the spicule matrix is SM50. SM50-related proteins, SM30-related proteins, MSP130 and related proteins, matrix metalloproteases and carbonic anhydrase are among the most abundant components.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The spicule matrix is a relatively complex mixture of proteins not only containing matrix-specific proteins with a function in matrix assembly or mineralization, but also: 1) proteins possibly important for the formation of the continuous membrane delineating the mineralization space; 2) proteins for secretory processes delivering proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous precursors; 3) or proteins reflecting signaling events at the cell/matrix interface. Comparison of the proteomes of different skeletal matrices allows prediction of proteins of general importance for mineralization in sea urchins, such as SM50, SM30-E, SM29 or MSP130. The comparisons also help point out putative tissue-specific proteins, such as tooth phosphodontin or specific spicule matrix metalloproteases of the MMP18/19 group. Furthermore, the direct sequence analysis of peptides by MS/MS validates many predicted genes and confirms the existence of the corresponding proteins.},

abstract = {The total alkalinity–pH equation, which relates total alkalinity and pH for a given set of total concentrations of the acid–base systems that contribute to total alkalinity in a given water sample, is reviewed and its mathematical properties established. We prove that the equation function is strictly monotone and always has exactly one positive root. Different commonly used approximations are discussed and compared. An original method to derive appropriate initial values for the iterative solution of the cubic polynomial equation based upon carbonate-borate-alkalinity is presented. We then review different methods that have been used to solve the total alkalinity–pH equation, with a main focus on biogeochemical models. The shortcomings and limitations of these methods are made out and discussed. We then present two variants of a new, robust and universally convergent algorithm to solve the total alkalinity–pH equation. This algorithm does not require any a priori knowledge of the solution. SolveSAPHE (Solver Suite for Alkalinity-PH Equations) provides reference implementations of several variants of the new algorithm in Fortran 90, together with new implementations of other, previously published solvers. The new iterative procedure is shown to converge from any starting value to the physical solution. The extra computational cost for the convergence security is only 10–15{\%} compared to the fastest algorithm in our test series.},

Data on the intracellular Ca ion cycling allowed for calculating a preliminary cellular Ca budget during foraminiferal calcification. This showed that the free calcium involved in the production of a new chamber cannot be sufficient and suggests that foraminifera may precipitate their calcite from an amorphous precursor.},

abstract = {Detailed quantitative analyses of selected calcareous nannofossil species from middle Eocene through early Oligocene sediment in South Atlantic (DSDP Sites 522 and 523) have refined the biochronologic precision of these events. The last ocurrences of R. umbilicus (33.80Ma) and D. saipanensis (36.72Ma) are not reliable due to low abundance at about the time of extinction. The latter species shows a drastic abundance decline shortly  before its extinction, at 37.09 Ma, which may prove to be a more reliable biochronologic indication than its absolutely final occurrence. The last occurrences of E. obruta (34.35Ma), B.serraculoides (34.79Ma), C.formosus (34.87Ma), D.barbadiensis (36.96Ma), C. grandis (40.03Ma) and Nannotetrina spp. (44.21Ma) all provide distinct species events in terms of abundance patterns. The last event may be used as substitute for the taxonomically problematic first occurrence of R. umbilicus (44.38Ma; as based on speciemens {\textgreater}14µm). Both D. hesslandii (42.89Ma) and E. obruta (36.07Ma) show distinct rises in abundance at the suggested age estimates, whereas the first occurrence of I.recurvus hardly represents a reliable indication due to its low abundances in the early part of the range and diachronous appearance over geographic distance. The last occurrence of I. recurvus (34.93Ma) is distinct  in terms of abundance, albeit diachronous over geographic distance, having an early exit at these South Atlantic sites which roughly correlates with estimates from tropical regions. The short intervals with high abundances of C. reticulatum and C. protoannula may suggest that their last occurrences (37.86Ma and 38.18Ma respectively) perhaps are ambiguous from a biochronological point of view.  An age of 36.15Ma to 36.20Ma is suggested for the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, as estimated from Hole 522 and using the Hantkenina extinction. The nearest nannofossil event is the first abundanct occurrence of E. obruta (36.07Ma) or, regionally (?), the sharp change in proportion between R.umbilicus  and C. formosus (36.10Ma).},

abstract = {Barium/calcium profiles of bivalve shells are characterized by flat background signals periodically interrupted by sharp peaks, with the background signals correlated with water Ba/Ca. To test if the peaks are an environmental signal related to productivity, we analyzed high-resolution Ba/Ca profiles in bivalve shells that grew adjacent to one another. Two aragonitic Saxidomus gigan- teus show remarkable similarity over a decade of growth, clearly indicating an environmental forcing. Four calcitic Pecten maximus shells also record synchronous Ba/Ca peaks, again indicating an exogenous control. The Ba/Ca peaks, however, start {\~{}}40 days after the crash of a bloom, while sedimentation takes place immediately following the bloom. Barite formation in settling phytoplankton flocs, as has been previously proposed, is clearly not the cause of these peaks. Other possible causes, such as dissolved Ba in ambient water, spawning, shell organic matter content, and kinetic growth rate effects are also discussed, but none provide satisfactory explanations. Background shell Ba partition coefficients (Ba/Cacarbonate/Ba/Cawater) for both the calcitic shells (0.18) and aragonitic shells (0.16) are similar to that previously reported for the calcitic Mytilus edulis ({\~{}}0.1).We suggest that Ba/Ca peaks in bivalve shells are caused by an as yet undetermined environmental forcing, while background Ba/Ca levels are a good indication of dissolved Ba/Ca in the water; both are independent of shell mineralogy.},

abstract = {In this review, the network of pathways that controls the timing of the transition to flowering has been divided into those that enable and those that promote the floral transition (Figure 4). The interaction of these different pathways changes in response to different environmental and endogenous cues to generate the plasticity and diversity of the flowering response. The pre- dominance of the different floral pathways also must change over the life cycle of the plant. During early vegetative de- velopment, floral repressors in the enabling pathways overcome any promotive cues, ensuring that a sufficiently long vegetative phase occurs for the necessary energy reserves to be accumu- lated. During the later stages of vegetative development, the activity of the floral repressors declines and there is a progressive activation of floral promoters until a quantitative threshold is reached and the transition of the meristem from a vegetative to a reproductive state occurs. The pattern of gene expression in the flowers then must be reset in the gametes and developing embryos so that the next generation can determine its own ‘‘right time to flower.'' Therefore, the plant life cycle can be viewed in three sequential floral phases resulting from the changing predominance of three activities: resetting, repression, and promotion (Figure 4). Judging from how fast our knowledge has progressed in the last few years, progress in determining the molecular basis of how these different phases are regulated and maintained should be rapid.},

In spite of the great ecological differences in these environments, they share a common trait: iron deficiency. All of these areas are far from Fe-rich terrestrial sources and atmospheric dust loads in these regions are amongst the lowest in the world. Experiments were performed in three nutrient-rich areas: The Gulf of Alaska, the Ross Sea, and the equatorial Pacific. In general, populations without added Fe doubled at rates 11-40{\%} of the expected maxima at various temperatures. The addition of nanomole quantities of Fe increased these doubling rates by factors of 2-3. In spite of the lack of Fe, tightly coupled phytoplankton/zooplankton communities seem to inhabit these major nutrient-rich areas. -from Authors},

Variations in Mg/Ca records from both the Atlantic and Pacific show a significant correlation with climatic oscillations of the last 330 kyr. Shell Mg/Ca peaks during interglacial episodes, with marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e Mg/Ca nearly matching Holocene values in both cores. Lower Mg/Ca values occur during glacial intervals. To estimate temperatures from downcore Mg/Ca, we have augmented the published Cibicidoides sp. Mg/Ca-temperature dataset [Rosenthal et al., Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 61 (1997) 3633-3643] with new data to include the temperature range of deep waters. Applying the 10.9{\%} change in Mg/Ca per ??C defined by the expanded calibration to the deep Atlantic data implies glacial-interglacial shifts in deep water temperature of 2-4??C over the last 300 kyr. Temperature estimates are comparable to deep Atlantic temperature changes proposed by Labeyrie et al. [Nature 327 (1987) 477-482]. There is greater uncertainty in deriving temperatures from the tropical Pacific core due to a limited Uvigerina spp. core top calibration set; however, glacial-interglacial temperature oscillations appear to be on the order of 2-3??C.

abstract = {The relationship between shell size and Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, d18O, and d13C of planktonic foraminiferal calcite has been investigated using seventeen species in six different size fractions. Mg/Ca increases and Sr/Ca decreases with increasing size, except for two globorotaliid species which show the opposite trend. The changes in Mg/Ca broadly follow d18O calcification temperatures except that surface and near-surface dwelling species show larger changes in Mg/Ca than can be accounted for by differences in calcification temperature derived from d18O. The increases in Mg/Ca and decreases in Sr/Ca vary linearly with the well-established increase in d13C with size. This is consistent with smaller individuals calcifying faster than larger individuals and larger individuals forming calcite that more closely reflects seawater temperature and composition. It appears that variations in calcification rate affect Mg and Sr shell chemistry. The observations may account for part of the temporal variability in foraminiferal Sr/Ca within a single size fraction that has been attributed to changes in seawater Sr/Ca.},

abstract = {This paper deals with a discussion of terminology and six proposed levels of biodiversity. Recent data and estimates were used to compare species and taxonomic diversity of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine organisms. About 1.5 million terrestrial species and 320000 aquatic species are hitherto known. In spite of a long history of research, only about 280000 marine species have been discovered, of which 180000 species are invertebrates. Of 33 metazoan phyla, 31 are found in the sea, 13 of these being exclusively marine. Seventeen metazoan phyla contain freshwater species, and only 11 phyla comprise terrestrial animals. Two phyla (freshwater Micrognathozoa and terrestrial Onychophora) possess no marine species. In this paper, we review the assessment reports on marine biological diversity in coral reefs, coastal ecosystems, macrobenthos, and meiofauna. Recent data on the number of known species are listed for each metazoan phylum; the number of anticipated new species to be discovered is estimated. Deep-sea macrobenthos are believed to comprise about 25 million species; meiofauna seems to be composed of 20 to 30 million species, ten million of whom are marine nematodes. Hypotheses are discussed that can account for the high species diversity of deep-sea macrobenthos and meiofauna.},

abstract = {We investigated the roles of three proteins associated with the formation of otoconia including fetuin A, osteopontin (OPN), and otoconin 90 (OC90). In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies of the effects of these proteins on the growth of atomic steps on calcite surfaces were performed to obtain insight into their effects on the growth kinetics. We also used scanning electron microscopy to examine the effects of these proteins on crystal morphology. All three proteins were found to be potent inhibitors of calcite growth, although fetuin A promoted growth at concentrations below about 40 nM and only became an inhibitor at higher concentrations. We then used in situ optical microscopy to observe calcite nucleation on films of these proteins adsorbed onto mica surfaces. By measuring the calcite nucleation rate as a function of supersaturation, the value of the interfacial energy that controls the free energy barrier to heterogeneous nucleation was determined for each protein. OPN and OC90 films led to significantly reduced interfacial energies as compared to the value for homogeneous calcite nucleation in bulk solution. The value for fetuin A was equal to that for bulk solution within experimental error. Zeta potential measurements showed all of the proteins possessed negative surface charge and varied in magnitude according to sequence fetuin A {\textgreater} OC90 {\textgreater} OPN. In addition, the interfacial energies exhibited an inverse scaling with the zeta potential. In analogy to previous measurements on polysaccharide films, this scaling indicates the differences between the proteins arise from the effect of protein surface charge on the solution-substrate interfacial energy.},

Such studies assume that the Ba/Ca ratio in planktic foraminifer shells is primarily controlled by the Ba/Ca concentration of seawater and that other parameters such as salinity, temperature and pH do not compromise the primary Ba concentration relationship. Here we provide new insights from culture experiments and review published studies to confirm that environmental parameters including pH, temperature, salinity, and symbiont photosynthesis do not affect Ba substitution into planktic foraminiferal calcite. The partition coefficient for Ba in spinose planktic foraminifers is estimated as DBa=0.15??0.05 (95{\%} confidence limits). The same factor also seems applicable to the non-spinose genus Neogloboquadrina but not to specimens of the non-spinose genus Globorotalia. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Culture experiments were carried out with the planktonic foraminifer Orbulina universa under high and low light levels in order to determine the influence of symbiont photosynthetic activity on the boron isotopic composition of shell calcite. Under low light (reduced photosynthetic rates) the boron isotopic composition of the tests is 1.5??? lower compared to shells grown under high light (elevated photosynthetic rates). In terms of inferred pH, the lower boron isotope values correspond to a reduction in pH of approximately 0.2 units. The boron isotopic composition of Orbulina universa from plankton tows is similar to that of shells grown under low light conditions in the laboratory. These data are consistent with reduced symbiont concentrations in recently secreted shells. In addition to laboratory and field grown O. universa, we present the first data for a symbiont-barren foraminifer, Globigerina bulloides. Data obtained for G. bulloides fall ???1.4??? below those of the field grown O. universa.

Rationalizing our observations, we divide the ion association interaction into two mechanisms: (1) poorly solvated iodide ions are attracted to hydrophobic surface patches, while (2) the strongly solvated fluoride and to a minor extent also iodide bind via cation-anion interactions. Quantitatively, the binding affinities vary significantly with the accessibility of the charged groups as well as the surface potential; therefore, we expect the ion-macromolecule association to be modulated by the local surface characteristics of the (bio-)macromolecule. The observed cation-anion pairing preference is in excellent agreement with experimental data.},

abstract = {Few constraints exist on the major element chemistry of ancient oceans. Turritellid marine snails precipitate aragonitic shells and are abundant in the Cenozoic fossil record, and therefore may be ideal for reconstructing past seawater chemistry. Here we report strontium to calcium (Sr/Ca) ratios of modern and early Cenozoic turritellid shells that still retain an aragonitic mineralogy. By applying partition coefficients determined from modern specimens to data for Paleocene and Eocene shells, we calculate paleo-seawater Sr/Ca values. The high Sr/Ca values recorded in fossil shells may imply that seawater Sr/Ca ratios varied from at least 9.5-15.2 mmol/mol, much higher than modern average seawater values (8.6 mmol/mol). High paleo-seawater Sr/Ca ratios may indicate that substantial changes in the biogeochemical cycling of Sr have occurred over the past {\~{}} 37 million years. A decrease in seawater strontium concentrations could have arisen from an increase in the proportion of weathered radiogenic silicate rocks relative to carbonates, reducing the riverine flux of strontium to the oceans, or changes in the exposure and erosion of aragonitic carbonates on tropical shelves due to variations in sea level. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Palmer and Edmond [Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 92 (1989) 11-26] indicated that thermally plausible oceanic hydrothermal inputs of strontium to the oceans are not sufficient to balance the riverine input. It has recently been suggested that off-axis low-temperature hydrothermal circulation may reconcile this discrepancy [e.g. Butterfield et al., Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 65 (2001) 4141-4153]. Strontium isotope alteration profiles are compiled for sampled in situ ocean and ophiolite crust to calculate a sustainable cumulative hydrothermal flux to the oceanic strontium budget. High-temperature circulation contributes ???1.8??109 mol yr-1 of basaltic strontium to the oceans. Enhanced hydrothermal systems in arc-related spreading environments (10{\%} of the crust) may increase this to ???2.3??109 mol yr-1. It is shown that low-temperature flow cannot supply the remaining flux required to reconcile the oceanic strontium budget (???8.7??109 mol yr-1) because this would require 100{\%} exchange of seawater strontium for basaltic strontium over an 820 m section of MORB-like crust. Currently sampled in situ ocean crust is not altered to this extent. The isotopic alteration intensity of 120 Myr crust sampled in DSDP Holes 417D and 418A indicates that off-axis low-temperature flow may contribute up to ???8??108 mol yr-1 of basaltic strontium (9{\%} of that required). The ocean crust can sustain a total basaltic strontium flux of ???3.1??0.8??109 mol yr-1 (87Sr/86Sr ???0.7025) to the oceans. This is consistent with hydrothermal flux estimates, but remains less than a third of the flux required to balance the oceanic strontium budget. The ocean crust cannot support a higher hydrothermal contribution unless the average ocean crust is significantly more altered than current observation. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The physiologically active part of the population, assessed by sequencing cDNA libraries of 16S rRNA amplicons, was very diverse, with an estimated ribotype richness ≥1,380 in anoxic sediment. Quantitative analysis of community structure by rRNA-targeted fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated that the archaeal population (9–18{\%}) was dominated by marine Crenarchaeota (5–9{\%}). Planctomycetales were the most abundant group in the oxic and interfacial habitat (17–19{\%}) but were a minority ({\textless}5{\%}) in anoxic reef sediment, where $\gamma$-Proteobacteria were numerically dominant (18{\%}). Another 9–14{\%} of the microbial benthos belonged to $\beta$-Proteobacteria, predominantly within the order Nitrosomonadales, many cultured representatives of which are NH4 + oxidizers. The results of this study contribute to the phylogenetic characterization of benthic microbial communities that are important in organic matter degradation and nutrient recycling in coral reef ecosystems.},

abstract = {The effects of towed fishing gear on benthic fauna are under intense scrutiny and evidence is growing that trawling may significantly affect benthic communities in the North Sea. Most studies explore the current fauna or compare today's situation with that of 2 or 3 decades ago, when North Sea-wide information on benthos and fishing became available. However, in the North Sea, extensive mechanised trawling began more than a century ago. This study compared historical and recent records in order to explore potential long-term links between changes in the epibenthos and fishing. Based on reconstructed species lists from museum specimens, we compared epibenthos data from 1902 to 1912 with those from 1982 to 1985 and 2000. We analysed changes in average taxonomic distinctness (AvTD), a biodiversity indicator, and changes in biogeographical species distributions. Landings data were collated for round- and flatfish caught in the northern, central and southern North Sea from 1906 to 2000 as proxies for total otter and beam trawl effort, respectively. These indicate that the southern and much of the central North Sea were fished intensively throughout the 20th century, whilst the northern North Sea was less exploited, especially in earlier decades; exploitation intensified markedly from the 1960s onwards. For epibenthos, the mean AvTD decreased significantly from the 1980s to 2000, when it was below expected values in 4 ICES rectangles, 3 of these located in heavily trawled areas. Biogeographical changes from the beginning to the end of the century occurred in 27 of 48 taxa. In 14 taxa, spatial presence was reduced by 50{\%} or more, most notably in the southern and central North Sea; often these were long-lived, slow-growing species with vulnerable shells or tests. By contrast, 12 taxa doubled their spatial presence throughout the North Sea. Most biogeographical changes had happened by the 1980s. Given that other important environmental changes, including eutrophication and climate change, have gained importance mainly from the 1980s onwards, we have concluded that the changes in epibenthos observed since the beginning of the 20th century have resulted primarily from intensified fisheries.},

abstract = {The principal objections to the proposition that organic agriculture can contribute significantly to the global food supply are low yields and insufficient quantities of organically acceptable fertilizers. We evaluated the universality of both claims. For the first claim, we compared yields of organic versus conventional or low-intensive food production for a global dataset of 293 examples and estimated the average yield ratio (organic : non-organic) of different food categories for the developed and the developing world. For most food categories, the average yield ratio was slightly {\textless}1.0 for studies in the developed world and {\textgreater}1.0 for studies in the developing world. With the average yield ratios, we modeled the global food supply that could be grown organically on the current agricultural land base. Model estimates indicate that organic methods could produce enough food on a global per capita basis to sustain the current human population, and potentially an even larger population, without increasing the agricultural land base. We also evaluated the amount of nitrogen potentially available from fixation by leguminous cover crops used as fertilizer. Data from temperate and tropical agroecosystems suggest that leguminous cover crops could fix enough nitrogen to replace the amount of synthetic fertilizer currently in use. These results indicate that organic agriculture has the potential to contribute quite substantially to the global food supply, while reducing the detrimental environmental impacts of conventional agriculture. Evaluation and review of this paper have raised important issues about crop rotations under organic versus conventional agriculture and the reliability of grey-literature sources. An ongoing dialogue on these subjects can be found in the Forum editorial of this issue.},

abstract = {We determined the faunal composition and total number of tests ({\#}/g) of planktic foraminifera ({\textgreater} 125????m) in core KH00-05 GOA 6 near Oman in order to decipher monsoon-induced variability of oceanographic productivity in the open-ocean upwelling area in the northwest Arabian Sea. The core contains a continuous record of sedimentation over the last 230??kyr, with the age model based on oxygen isotope and accelerator mass spectrometry 
                        14C dates. We focused on species (Globigerina bulloides and Globigerinita glutinata) typical for SW monsoonal upwelling and species typical for NE monsoon conditions (Neogloboquadrina incompta, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Globigerinoides ruber, and Globigerinoides sacculifer). The changes in relative abundance of these monsoonal indicators suggest that the open-ocean upwelling area was dominated by the SW monsoon during interglacial periods, but by the NE monsoon during glacial periods. Increases in total test abundance during glacial periods confirmed that the NE monsoon rather than SW monsoon contributes largely to planktic foraminiferal productivity in this area. We argue that three types of circumstances resulted in high productivity, with nine high productivity events occurring at a 23-kyr frequency. The first type caused high productivity events at 102 and 199??ka (interglacial periods), characterized by the dominance of upwelling species, indicating high productivity during strong SW monsoons, correlated with high July insolation at 45?? N. An exceptional high productivity event occurred at 37??ka during interglacial marine isotope stage (MIS) 3, with contributions from both SW and NE monsoons. The second type of high productivity event occurred at 61, 147, and 175??ka, during glacial periods, characterized by dominance of NE monsoon species, and correlated with low January insolation at 45?? N. In addition, a high productivity event at 85??ka (interglacial period) also was induced by enhanced NE monsoons. The last two high productivity events occurred during transitional periods from glacial to interglacial (MIS 6/5.5 and 2/1), were characterized by the replacement of NE monsoon species with upwelling species, and corresponded to abrupt climate warming, suggesting that they are related to both accelerated SW monsoon systems and reduced NE monsoon systems. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The significant relative mass difference (c. 16{\%}) between the two stable isotopes of Li (approximately 6Li 7.5{\%}, 7Li 92.5{\%}), coupled with broad elemental dispersion in Earth and planetary materials, makes this a system of considerable interest in fingerprinting geochemical processes, determining mass balances, and in thermometry. Natural mass fractionation in this system is responsible for c. 6{\%} variation among materials examined to date (Fig. 1⇓). Although the “modern era” of Li isotope quantification has begun, there are still many questions about the Li isotopic compositions of fundamental materials and the nature of fractionation by important mechanisms that are unanswered (e.g., Hoefs 1997).  Figure 1. Summary of lithium isotopic compositions of Earth and planetary materials. Filled bars are solid samples, open bars are liquids. See text for references and details.  The purpose of this chapter is to summarize the current understanding of Li isotopes in geo- and cosmochemical systems and to indicate (1) where Li isotopes have a high probability of adding new understanding of these systems; (2) where some of the more significant deficits in knowledge exist. The small but burgeoning Li isotope community has not yet compiled the volume of peer-reviewed literature needed to adequately assess even that which has been studied to date. As a result, significant portions of this chapter are based on data reported in abstracts, and as such are more than normally subject to revisions over time. This chapter is anticipated to serve as a starting point for those interested in research incorporating Li isotope geochemistry, or in understanding the state of extant research.},

House-hunting ant colonies choose a new nest more quickly in harsh conditions than in benign ones and are less discriminating. The errors that occur in a harsh environment are errors of judgement not errors of omission because the colonies have discovered all of the alternative nests before they initiate an emigration. Leptothorax albipennis ants use quorum sensing in their house hunting. They only accept a nest, and begin rapidly recruiting members of their colony, when they find within it a sufficient number of their nest-mates. Here we show that these ants can lower their quorum thresholds between benign and harsh conditions to adjust their speed-accuracy trade-off. Indeed, in harsh conditions these ants rely much more on individual decision making than collective decision making. Our findings show that these ants actively choose to take their time over judgements and employ collective decision making in benign conditions when accuracy is more important than speed.},

Sr/Casw is ultimately governed by the remineralization of Sr-containing shells of surface water-derived marine organisms (e.g., Acantharia) at intermediate water depths. California margin Sr/Cacoral records from 792 and 1295 m document fluctuations in Sr/Casw that appear decadal-scale.

abstract = {Distributions of Mg and Sr in the skeletons of a deep-sea coral (Caryophyllia ambrosia) and a shallow-water, reef-building coral (Pavona clavus) have been obtained with a spatial resolution of 150 nm, using the NanoSIMS ion microprobe at the Mus{\'{e}}um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. These trace element analyses focus on the two primary ultra-structural components in the skeleton: centers of calcification (COC) and fibrous aragonite. In fibrous aragonite, the trace element variations are typically on the order of 10{\%} or more, on length scales on the order of 1-10 lm. Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca variations are not correlated. However, Mg/Ca variations in Pavona are strongly correlated with the layered organization of the skeleton. These data allow for a direct comparison of trace element variations in zooxanthellate and non-zooxanthellate corals. In both corals, all trace elements show variations far beyond what can be attributed to variations in the marine environment. Furthermore, the observed trace element variations in the fibrous (bulk) part of the skeletons are not related to the activity of zooxanthellae, but result from other biological activity in the coral organism. To a large degree, this biological forcing is independent of the ambient marine environment, which is essentially constant on the growth timescales considered here. Finally, we discuss the possible detection of a new high-Mg calcium carbonate phase, which appears to be present in both deep-sea and reef-building corals and is neither aragonite nor calcite. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic eutrophication affects the Mediterranean, Black, North and Baltic Seas to various extents. Responses to nutrient loading and methods of monitoring relevant indicators vary regionally, hindering interpretation of ecosystem state changes and preventing a straightforward pan-European assessment of eutrophication symptoms. Here we summarize responses to nutrient enrichment in Europe's seas, comparing existing time-series of selected pelagic (phytoplankton biomass and community composition, turbidity, N:P ratio) and benthic (macro flora and faunal communities, bottom oxygen condition) indicators based on their effectiveness in assessing eutrophication effects. Our results suggest that the Black Sea and Northern Adriatic appear to be recovering from eutrophication due to economic reorganization in the Black Sea catchment and nutrient abatement measures in the case of the Northern Adriatic. The Baltic is most strongly impacted by eutrophication due to its limited exchange and the prevalence of nutrient recycling. Eutrophication in the North Sea is primarily a coastal problem, but may be exacerbated by climatic changes. Indicator interpretation is strongly dependent on sea-specific knowledge of ecosystem characteristics, and no single indicator can be employed to adequately compare eutrophication state between European seas. Communicating eutrophication-related information to policy-makers could be facilitated through the use of consistent indicator selection and monitoring methodologies across European seas.

abstract = {Significant amounts of SO42-, Na+, and OH- are incorporated in marine biogenic calcites. Biogenic high Mg-calcites average about 1 mole percent SO42-. Aragonites and most biogenic low Mg-calcites contain significant amounts of Na+, but very low concentrations of SO42-. The SO42- content of non-biogenic calcites and aragonites investigated was below 100 ppm. The presence of Na+ and SO42- increases the unit cell size of calcites. The solid-solutions show a solubility minimum at about 0.5 mole percent SO42- beyond which the solubility rapidly increases. The solubility product of calcites containing 3 mole percent SO42- is the same as that of aragonite. Na+ appears to have very little effect on the solubility product of calcites. The amounts of Na+ and SO42- incorporated in calcites vary as a function of the rate of crystal growth. The variation of the distribution coefficient (D) of SO42- in calcite at 25.0??C and 0.50 molal NaCl is described by the equation D = k0 + k1R where k0 and k1 are constants equal to 6.16 ?? 10-6 and 3.941 ?? 10-6, respectively, and R is the rate of crystal growth of calcite in mg??min-1??g-1 of seed. The data on Na+ are consistent with the hypothesis that a significant amount of Na+ occupies interstitial positions in the calcite structure. The distribution of Na+ follows a Freundlich isotherm and not the Berthelot-Nernst distribution law. The numerical value of the Na+ distribution coefficient in calcite is probably dependent on the number of defects in the calcite structure. The Na+ contents of calcites are not very accurate indicators of environmental salinities. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {A simple model of the CaCO3 saturation state of the ocean is presented. It can be solved analytically and is intended to identify the fundamental controls on ocean carbonate ion concentration. It should also attract researchers unfamiliar with complex biogeochemical models. Despite its limitations, the model-calculated CaCO3 saturation state of today's ocean agrees well with observations. In general, the model reveals three distinctly different modes of operation: The “Strangelove Ocean” of high supersaturation which is dominated by inorganic CaCO3 precipitation, (2) the “Neritan Ocean” of indefinite saturation dominated by biogenic shallow-water CaCO3 precipitation, and (3) the “Cretan Ocean” of low saturation dominated by biogenic pelagic CaCO3 precipitation. In the latter mode, the deep ocean [CO3 2−] is remarkably stable, provided that the biogenic production of CaCO3 exceeds the riverine flux of Ca2+ and CO3 2−. This explains the overall constancy of the saturation state of the ocean documented over the last 100 Ma. The model is then used to address diverse questions. One important result is that the recovery of the oceanic carbonate chemistry from fossil fuel neutralization in the future will be accelerated due to expected reduced biogenic calcification.},

Problems arise in calculation of water fluxes because of uncertainties in (a) values of off-axis fluxes and (b) the partition of axial heat flow between high-temperature black smoker and lower-temperature diffuse flow. Of the various geochemical methods of estimating fluxes, 3 He/heat data are extremely variable, the Mg method is sensitive to flank fluxes, Sr isotopes agree with geophysical estimates only if flank fluxes are important, Li isotopes data are consistent with geophysical values, and Ge/Si ratios give low fluxes, which may reflect low-temperature processes not yet fully quantified. Estimates of hydrothermal heat and water fluxes derived from these approaches are presented as are hydrothermal chemical fluxes at the ridge axis, off axis, and as affected by hydrothermal plumes.},

However, the carbonate system controls on B/Ca ratios are not straightforward, with $\Delta$[ inline image] ([ inline image]in situ – [ inline image]at saturation) correlating best with B/Ca ratios in benthic foraminifera, rather than pH, inline image, or inline image (as a simple model of boron speciation in seawater and incorporation into CaCO3 would predict). Furthermore, culture experiments have shown that in planktic foraminifera properties such as salinity and [B]sw can have profound effects on B/Ca ratios beyond those predicted by simple partition coefficients. Here, we investigate the controls on B/Ca ratios in G. ruber via a combination of culture experiments and core-top measurements, and add to a growing body of evidence that suggests B/Ca ratios in symbiont-bearing foraminiferal carbonate are not a straightforward proxy for past seawater carbonate system conditions. We find that while B/Ca ratios in culture experiments covary with pH, in open ocean sediments this relationship is not seen. In fact, our B/Ca data correlate best with [ inline image] (a previously undocumented association) and in most regions, salinity. These findings might suggest a precipitation rate or crystallographic control on boron incorporation into foraminiferal calcite. Regardless, our results underscore the need for caution when attempting to interpret B/Ca records in terms of the ocean carbonate system, at the very least in the case of mixed-layer planktic foraminifera.},

abstract = {We use LA-ICP-MS depth profiling to explore the sensitivity of shell chemistry of the symbiotic planktic foraminifer Orbulina universa to diurnal changes in the holobiont physiology, over a wide range of seawater pH and DIC compositions. B/Ca and U/Ca vary in concert with diurnal Mg/Ca banding, forming compositional bands that are qualitatively consistent with physiological modification of seawater carbonate chemistry (pH, [B(OH)4???/HCO3???] and [CO32???]) within the foraminiferal microenvironment by the net effects of photosynthesis, respiration and calcification. The amplitude of B/Ca banding broadly conforms to banding predicted using the bulk-shell B/Ca sensitivity to the carbonate chemistry changes in the foraminiferal microenvironment. U/Ca banding tends to be greater than predicted using the published bulk-shell sensitivity of this proxy to carbonate chemistry. This either suggests that carbonate chemistry changes in the foraminiferal microenvironment are greater than predicted by modeling and/or the published bulk shell calibration does not accurately reflect the U/Ca sensitivity at the micro-scale. A fourfold increase in seawater DIC composition (1026 to 4019 ??mol kg???1) is associated with significant increases in Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca partitioning, and a decrease in Mn/Ca partitioning into shell calcite. The accompanying fourfold increase in calcite saturation produces only a twofold increase in calcification rate (0.14 to 0.28, ??0.02 ??m???hr???1), suggesting that seawater carbonate chemistry exerts only a small effect on foraminiferal calcification rates, but does have a significant influence on trace element incorporation at both the inter-shell and bulk-shell scale.},

Here we present atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) reconstructions based on multi-site boron-isotope records from the late Pliocene epoch (3.3 to 2.3 million years ago). We find that Earth/'s climate sensitivity to CO2-based radiative forcing (Earth system sensitivity) was half as strong during the warm Pliocene as during the cold late Pleistocene epoch (0.8 to 0.01 million years ago). We attribute this difference to the radiative impacts of continental ice-volume changes (the ice-albedo feedback) during the late Pleistocene, because equilibrium climate sensitivity is identical for the two intervals when we account for such impacts using sea-level reconstructions. We conclude that, on a global scale, no unexpected climate feedbacks operated during the warm Pliocene, and that predictions of equilibrium climate sensitivity (excluding long-term ice-albedo feedbacks) for our Pliocene-like future (with CO2 levels up to maximum Pliocene levels of 450 parts per million) are well described by the currently accepted range of an increase of 1.5 K to 4.5 K per doubling of CO2.},

abstract = {The distribution of zinc between precipitates of calcium carbonate and saturated aqueous solution at low ionic strength has been measured at 25, 35 and 50°C. After two weeks of digestion at the precipitation temperature, the distribution at 50° was homogeneous, but at the lower temperatures logarithmic distributions were found. At 50° the partition coefficient D = 3.2 ± 0.2, and, by comparing with the ratio of solubility product constants K(calcite)/ K(smithsonite) = 34.0, we calculate the activity coefficient of ZnCO3 in dilute solid solution with CaCO3 to be $\gamma$ = 10.6 ± 0.7. This quantity is relatively independent of temperature but is dependent on complex ion chemistry of the aqueous solution and may be revised if new complexes of Zn(II) or Ca(II) should be found. Recrystallization at 50° must be extensive to form homogeneous crystals, but at 35 and 25° recrystallization must be very much slower to preserve the logarithmic distribution, an observation consistent with previously reported observations on calcite-aragonite composition of precipitates. Many carbonates of trace elements are less soluble than calcite or aragonite, and these should be coprecipitated with calcium carbonate in nature.},

abstract = {The principal source of dissolved inorganic carbon (C sub(T)) of most marine phytoplankton is thought to be free CO sub(2), but Emiliania huxleyi can utilize HCO sub(3) super(-) ion both for calcification (C) and photosynthesis (P). We present a simple model that simulates continuous diurnal removal of C sub(T) as either free CO sub(2) or HCO sub(3) super(-) across the range of C sub(T) typically encountered in seawater (2,100-1,800 mu mol kg sub(s) sub(w) super(-1)). Removal as free CO sub(2) forces a drawdown in partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide (PCO sub(2)), at given C sub(T), of up to 170 mu atm greater than that forced by removal as HCO sub(3) super(-) by E. huxleyi (assuming C sub(net): P sub(net) = 1.0). Diurnal C sub(net):P sub(net) must exceed 1.5 for PCO sub(2) to increase during removal of HCO sub(3) super(-). When nocturnal respiration of free CO sub(2) (R) is incorporated into the model, the respective drawdowns in PCO sub(2) forced by diurnal removal of free CO sub(2) and HCO sub(3) super(-) are balanced by diel ratios R:P sub(net) = 1.0 and R:(P+C) sub(net) approximately 0.15. Therefore, with diel R:(P+C) sub(net) {\textgreater} 0.15 but diurnal C sub(net):P sub(net) = 1.0, E. huxleyi can theoretically grow with net diel increase in PCO sub(2); however, diel C sub(net):P sub(net) {\textgreater} 1.0 is forced by nocturnal loss of particulate organic carbon but not particulate inorganic carbon. Published values for C:P do not necessarily represent diel C sub(net):P sub(net) and caution is required when extrapolating these ratios to predict changes in C sub(T) and PCO sub(2) during natural blooms of E. huxleyi.},

abstract = {Measurements of trace metal ratios in foraminiferal calcite are routinely used to reconstruct paleoceanographic conditions. Analyses using solution-based inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) require dissolution of the entire foraminifer shell. The potential exists for contamination from adherent clays, mineralized coatings, and other diagenetic components that confound the biogenic trace metal signal. We present results from a cleaning experiment on fossil specimens of the planktic foraminifer Orbulina universa that were cracked into several shell fragments and subjected to different cleaning protocols. We use laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) depth profiling to evaluate the effects of reductive, oxidative, and chelating (diethylene-triamine pentaacetic acid) cleaning protocols on shell Mg/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios. Using the natural pattern of intrashell Mg/Ca heterogeneity exhibited by O. universa, we demonstrate that reductive and oxidative cleaning can dissolve shell calcite from available surfaces, although intrashell Mg/Ca minima and maxima are unaffected. High-resolution depth profiles can be used to identify areas of heterogeneous intrashell Ba/Ca, which can be excluded from computations of whole-shell Ba/Ca. The size and density of shell pores plays a major role in the degree of contamination from sedimentary material. We demonstrate an approach for computing whole-shell Me/Ca ratios from LA-ICP-MS depth profiles that accounts for potential contamination and diagenetic overprinting.},

Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4 and histone acetylation are associated with active FLC expression, whereas histone deacetylation and histone H3 dimethylation at lysines 9 and 27 are involved in FLC repression. These chromatin modifications provide an additional level of regulation of gene expression beyond that of the transcription factors that recruit RNA polymerase to target genes.},

The removal of extracellular media before analysis is necessary, but the rinsing technique should not damage the plasma membrane of the cell. The presence of intracellular salts reduced the secondary ion yield an average of 2.6-fold during Bi-3(+)/C-60(++) depth profiles. Chemical fixation followed by rinsing removed a majority of the intracellular salts, "recovering" the positive secondary ion yields. The formaldehyde-fixation process removed a majority of the intracellular Cl-, but other key anions were not removed in significant amounts. The data presented here is consistent the anion neutralization mechanism largely responsible for the lower ion yields. All of the organic secondary ions that were detected in the freeze-dried cells were also detected in the formaldehyde-fixed cells, suggesting that the fixation process did not remove any molecular species to an extent that is detectable by ToF-SIMS. Compared to freeze dried cells, well preserved, frozen-hydrated cells showed little increase, or a decreased yield, for most low mass ions, but an increased yield for larger mass fragments. This is consistent with a reduced damage cross section at cryogenic analysis temperatures, although proton donation from water and reduction the salt effects in the presence of water likely also play roles. Numerous ions detected from the frozen-hydrated cells were not detected from the freeze dried cells, however many of these ions were attributed to chemical combinations of water, salts and the ammonium acetate rinsing solution.},

Newly applied radiocarbon age dates from the deep water proteinaceous corals Gerardia sp. and Leiopathes sp. show that radial growth rates are as low as 4 to 35 mum year(-1) and that individual colony longevities are on the order of thousands of years. The longest-lived Gerardia sp. and Leiopathes sp. specimens were 2,742 years and 4,265 years, respectively. The management and conservation of deep-sea coral communities is challenged by their commercial harvest for the jewelry trade and damage caused by deep-water fishing practices.

abstract = {Sediments recovered at ODP Site 1262 on Walvis Ridge (eastern South Atlantic Ocean, paleodepth ??? 2500-3000??m) offer an opportunity to look into the nature and cause(s) of the benthic foraminiferal turnover across the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary at abyssal depths at a location relatively remote from the location of the asteroid impact on the Yucatan peninsula. Late Maastrichtian assemblages were diverse and heterogeneous, reflecting oligo- to mesotrophic conditions at the sea floor. As at other locations, there was no significant extinction of benthic foraminiferal species at the K/Pg boundary, but the diversity and heterogeneity of the assemblages decreased precipitously. The percentage of infaunal buliminid taxa decreased rapidly, but the total percentage of infaunal taxa remained essentially unchanged. Benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates (BFAR) dropped at the boundary itself, and fluctuated strongly later in the Danian. After the K/Pg boundary, opportunistic taxa increased in relative abundance, and diversity and heterogeneity strongly fluctuated. There thus is no clear agreement between three proxies which have been used to indicate a high food supply to the sea floor: percentage buliminids, percentage infaunal taxa, and BFAR. This discrepancy might indicate that the food supply changed in character (e.g., type of food, temporal variability in flux), but did not show a long-term, large net change in total amount. The strong fluctuations in BFAR, heterogeneity and diversity indicate that environmental instability started at the K/Pg boundary, and persisted through planktic foraminiferal zones P?? and P1a. In lower planktic foraminiferal zone P1b, agglutinated species of the genera Spiroplectammina and Clavulinoides, thought to be infaunal and indicative of increasing levels of food supply, increased in relative abundance while the relative abundance of buliminids remained low. Possibly, agglutinated taxa took over at least part of the infaunal niche in the Paleocene, as a result of the rise in the calcium carbonate compensation depth. Towards the upper part of the studied interval (lower planktic foraminiferal Subzone 1c), benthic foraminiferal assemblages stabilized, with heterogeneity almost back to Maastrichtian values, although diversity and BFAR did not fully recover. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The bacterial community associated with black band disease (BBD) of the scleractinian corals Diploria strigosa, Montastrea annularis and Colpophyllia natans was examined using culture-independent techniques. Two complementary molecular screening techniques of 16S rDNA genes [amplified 16S ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) of clone libraries and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)] were used to give a comprehensive characterization of the community. Findings support previous studies indicating low bacterial abundance and diversity associated with healthy corals. A single cyanobacterial ribotype was present in all the diseased samples, but this was not the same as that identified from Phormidium corallyticum culture isolated from BBD. The study confirms the presence of Desulfovibrio spp. and sulphate-reducing bacteria that have previously been associated with the BBD consortium. However, the species varied between diseased coral samples. We found no evidence of bacteria from terrestrial, freshwater or human sources in any of the samples. We report the presence of previously unrecognized potential pathogens [a Cytophaga sp. and an alpha-proteobacterium identified as the aetiological agent of juvenile oyster disease (JOD)] that were consistently present in all the diseased coral samples. The molecular biological approach described here gives an increasingly comprehensive and more precise picture of the bacterial population associated with BBD. To understand the pathogenesis of BBD, our attention should be focused on the pervasive ribotypes identified in this study (the Cyanobacterium sp., the Cytophaga sp. and the JOD pathogen).},

Results from DSDP and ODP Sites 552A, 610A, 607, 658A, 659A, 661A and 704 for the period Ma reveal both depth and latitudinal gradients of mean Mg/Ca values.

abstract = {Two late Miocene Tridacna (giant clam) shells from East Kalimantan (Indonesia) were investigated in order to evaluate their potential as subannually resolved paleoenvironmental archives. Via a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) trace element analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging, pristine versus diagenetically altered domains within the shells were identified. LA-ICPMS transects targeting altered aragonite and calcite zones reveal distinct compositional differences in elemental ratios (B/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca/ Ba/Ca, Mn/Ca, Al/Ca, La/Ca, Ce/Ca) relative to primary shell aragonite. Pristine shell domains are characterized by an intact banding pattern of alternating dark and light growth bands, with which spatially resolved LA-ICPMS element/Ca and micromilled d18O records were aligned. Light d18O values correspond to dark growth bands, indicating growth during warm seasons. The Mg/Ca and/or Sr/Ca ratios covary with oscillating stable oxygen isotope profiles. Progressive increase in Mg/Ca with age demonstrates that besides temperature, growth kinetics exert control over Mg incorporation. If interpreted as temperature controlled only, d18O from both shells represents average seasonal sea-surface temperature (SST) variability of 2.7±2.1 and 4.6±1.7 uC, respectively. Using published temperature equations and assuming d18Osw = 20.88{\%}, corresponding mean annual paleo–sea-surface temperatures of 27.8 ± 0.2 and 28.5 ± 0.2 uC are estimated. Although the fossil Tridacna shells were noticeably affected by alteration on their external surfaces, their internal aragonitic structure is, to a large extent, well preserved. These corresponding paleoproxy records provide detailed insight into tropical SST variability of the Indo-Pacific region during the late Miocene.},

abstract = {In this paper, we review the current understanding of biomineralization in Rotaliid foraminifera. Ideas on the mechanisms responsible for the flux of Ca2+ and inorganic carbon from seawater into the test were originally based on light and electron microscopic observations of calcifying foraminifera. From the 1980's onward, tracer experiments, fluorescent microscopy and high-resolution test geochemical analysis have added to existing calcification models. Despite recent insights, no general consensus on the physiological basis of foraminiferal biomineralization exists. Current models include seawater vacuolization, transmembrane ion transport, involvement of organic matrices and/or pH regulation, although the magnitude of these controls remain to be quantified. Disagreement between currently available models may be caused by use of different foraminiferal species as subject for biomineralization experiments and/or lack of a more systematic approach to study (dis)similarities between taxa. In order to understand foraminiferal controls on element incorporation and isotope fractionation, and thereby improve the value of foraminifera as paleoceanographic proxies, it is necessary to identify key processes in foraminiferal biomineralization and formulate hypotheses regarding the involved physiological pathways to provide directions for future research.},

abstract = {Echinoderms possess a rigid endoskeleton composed of calcite and small amounts of occluded organic matrix proteins. The test (i.e., the shell-like structure of adults), spines, pedicellariae, tube feet, and teeth of adults, as well as delicate endoskeletal spicules found in larvae of some classes, are the main skeletal structures. They have been intensively studied for insight into the mechanisms of biomineralization. Recent work on characterization of the mineral phase and occluded proteins in embryonic skeletal spicules shows that these simple-looking structures contain scores of different proteins, and that the mineral phase is composed of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), which then transforms to an anhydrous ACC and eventually to calcite. Likewise, the adult tooth shows a similar transition from hydrated ACC to anhydrous ACC to calcite during its formation, and a similar transition is likely occurring during adult spine regeneration. We speculate that: (1) the ACC precursor is a general strategy employed in biomineralization in echinoderms, (2) the numerous occluded proteins play a role in post-secretion formation of the mature biomineralized structure, and (3) proteins with "multi-valent" intrinsically disordered domains are important for formation of occluded matrix structures, and regulation of crucial matrix-mineral interactions, such as ACC to calcite transitions and polymorph selection.},

abstract = {CO2 released from combustion of fossil fuels equilibrates among the various carbon reservoirs of the atmosphere, the ocean, and the terrestrial biosphere on timescales of a few centuries. However, a sizeable fraction of the CO2 remains in the atmosphere, awaiting a return to the solid earth by much slower weathering processes and deposition of CaCO3. Common measures of the atmospheric lifetime of CO2, including the e-folding time scale, disregard the long tail. Its neglect in the calculation of global warming potentials leads many to underestimate the longevity of anthropogenic global warming. Here, we review the past literature on the atmospheric lifetime of fossil fuel CO2 and its impact on climate, and we present initial results from a model intercomparison project on this topic. The models agree that 20?35{\%} of the CO2 remains in the atmosphere after equilibration with the ocean (2?20 centuries). Neutralization by CaCO3 draws the airborne fraction down further on timescales of 3 to 7 kyr.},

The pH of the solution was controlled by slowly bubbling high-purity NH3 or CO2 gas at 25±0.5°C, assuming that the pH at which nucleation takes place is the same as the average pH of the solution.

The precipitated CaCO3 is dominated by crystalline calcite, as identified by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry.

abstract = {The ratio of boron to calcium (B/Ca) in marine biogenic carbonates has been proposed as a proxy for properties of seawater carbonate chemistry. Applying this proxy to planktic foraminifera residing in the surface seawater largely in equilibrium with the atmosphere may provide a valuable handle on past atmospheric CO2concentrations. However, precise controls on B/Ca in planktic foraminifera remain enigmatic because it has been shown to depend on multiple physicochemical seawater properties. To help establish a firm inorganic basis for interpreting the B/Ca records, we examined the effect of a suite of chemical parameters ([Ca2+], pH, [DIC], salinity and [PO43−]) on B/Ca in inorganic calcite precipitated in artificial seawater. These parameters were primarily varied individually while keeping all others constant, but we also tested the influence of pH and [DIC] at a constant calcite precipitation rate (R) by concurrent [Ca2+] adjustments. In the simple [Ca2+], pH and [DIC] experiments, both R and B/Ca increased with these parameters. In the pH–[Ca2+] and [DIC]–[Ca2+] experiments at constant R, on the other hand, B/Ca was invariant at different pH and decreased with [DIC], respectively. These patterns agree with the behavior of solution [BTotal/DIC] ratio such that, at a fixed [BTotal], it is independent of pH but decreases with [DIC]. Based on these results, R and [BTotal/DIC] ratio appear to be the primary controls on B/Ca in inorganic calcite, suggesting that both B(OH)4−and B(OH)3are possibly involved in B incorporation. Moreover, B/Ca modestly increased with salinity and [PO43−]. Inorganic calcite precipitated at higher R and in the presence of oxyanions such as SO42−and PO43−in growth solutions often undergoes surface roughening due to formation of crystallographic defects, vacancies and, occasionally, amorphous/hydrous CaCO3. These non-lattice sites may provide additional space for B, particularly B(OH)3. Consequently, besides the macroscopic influence of R and bulk solution chemistry, molecular-scale processes associated with calcite nucleation can be an important consideration for B incorporation, especially in complex ionic solutions. Lastly, the covariance of B/Ca with [DIC] and salinity observed here qualitatively agrees with those in planktic foraminifers. It follows that their impact on foraminiferal B/Ca is partly inorganically driven, which may explain why the effect is evident across different species.},

abstract = {A generalized physicochemical model of the response of marine organisms' calcifying fluids to CO2-induced ocean acidification is proposed. The model is based upon the hypothesis that some marine calcifiers induce calcification by elevating pH, and thus $\Omega$A, of their calcifying fluid by removing protons (H+). The model is explored through two end-member scenarios: one in which a fixed number of H+ is removed from the calcifying fluid, regardless of atmospheric pCO2, and another in which a fixed external-internal H+ ratio ([H+]E/[H+]I) is maintained. The model is able to generate the full range of calcification response patterns observed in prior ocean acidification experiments and is consistent with the assertion that organisms' calcification response to ocean acidification is more negative for marine calcifiers that exert weaker control over their calcifying fluid pH. The model is empirically evaluated for the temperate scleractinian coral Astrangia poculata with in situ pH microelectrode measurements of the coral's calcifying fluid under control and acidified conditions. These measurements reveal that (1) the pH of the coral's calcifying fluid is substantially elevated relative to its external seawater under both control and acidified conditions, (2) the coral's [H+]E/[H+]I is approximately the same under control and acidified conditions, and (3) the coral removes fewer H+ from its calcifying fluid under acidified conditions than under control conditions. Thus, the carbonate system dynamics of A. poculata's calcifying fluid appear to be most consistent with the fixed [H+]E/[H+]I end-member scenario. Similar microelectrode experiments performed on additional taxa are required to assess the model's general applicability. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A number of analytical methods and techniques (X-ray diffraction, FT-IR and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, ionic chromatography, scanning electron microscopy, etc.) have been used to study the mode and sites of incorporation of some common inorganic anions (S0(4)(2-), NO3- and Cl-) in the calcite crystal lattice. Calcite, the thermodynamically stable calcium carbonate polymorph under standard conditions, was prepared by spontaneous precipitation from calcium hydroxide and carbonic acid solutions. The particular co-anion was added into the carbonic acid solution in the form of a calcium salt before mixing the reactants. The system prepared in such a way is particularly suitable for investigating the mode of foreign anion incorporation into the crystal lattice of calcite. Apart from the constituent ions and the products of water protolysis, this system contains only the co-anion examined. In order to study the local environment in the calcite crystal lattice by EPR spectroscopy, Mn2+ was used as a paramagnetic substitute for Ca2+. The experiments were performed at 25degreesC and the samples for analyses were taken after a predetermined ageing time of 20 min. It was found that the co-anions, when added in the concentrations examined, did not affect the morphology of the calcite crystals but were incorporated into the calcite structure. The largest distortion of the calcite structure was obtained when sulfate ions were added. The measured parameters of the calcite unit cell are given, the results obtained are discussed and a model that explains the possible mode and sites of sulfate incorporation is presented.

abstract = {The boron isotope systematics has been determined for azooxanthellate scleractinian corals from a wide range of both deep-sea and shallow-water environments. The aragonitic coral species, Caryophyllia smithii, Desmophyllum dianthus, Enallopsammia rostrata, Lophelia pertusa, and Madrepora oculata, are all found to have relatively high $\delta$ 11B compositions ranging from 23.2‰ to 28.7‰. These values lie substantially above the pH-dependent inorganic seawater borate equilibrium curve, indicative of strong up-regulation of pH of the internal calcifying fluid (pH cf), being elevated by {\~{}}0.6-0.8units ($\Delta$pH) relative to ambient seawater. In contrast, the deep-sea calcitic coral Corallium sp. has a significantly lower $\delta$ 11B composition of 15.5‰, with a corresponding lower $\Delta$pH value of {\~{}}0.3units, reflecting the importance of mineralogical control on biological pH up-regulation.The solitary coral D. dianthus was sampled over a wide range of seawater pH T and shows an approximate linear correlation with $\Delta$pH Desmo=6.43-0.71pH T (r 2=0.79). An improved correlation is however found with the closely related parameter of seawater aragonite saturation state, where $\Delta$pH Desmo=1.09-0.14$\Omega$ arag (r 2=0.95), indicating the important control that carbonate saturation state has on calcification. The ability to up-regulate internal pH cf, and consequently $\Omega$ cf, of the calcifying fluid is therefore a process present in both azooxanthellate and zooxanthellate aragonitic corals, and is attributed to the action of Ca 2+-ATPase in modulating the proton gradient between seawater and the site of calcification. These findings also show that the boron isotopic compositions ($\delta$ 11B carb) of aragonitic corals are highly systematic and consistent with direct uptake of the borate species within the biologically controlled extracellular calcifying medium.We also show that the relatively strong up-regulation of pH and consequent elevation of the internal carbonate saturation state ($\Omega$ cf {\~{}}8.5 to {\~{}}13) at the site of calcification by cold-water corals, facilitates calcification at or in some cases below the aragonite saturation horizon, providing a greater ability to adapt to the already low and now decreasing carbonate ion concentrations. Although providing greater resilience to the effects of ocean acidification and enhancing rates of calcification with increasing temperature, the process of internal pH cf up-regulation has an associated energetic cost, and therefore growth-rate cost, of {\~{}}10{\%} per 0.1 pH unit decrease in seawater pH T. Furthermore, as the aragonite saturation horizon shoals with rapidly increasing pCO 2 and $\Omega$ arag{\textless}1, increased dissolution of the exposed skeleton will ultimately limit their survival in the deep oceans. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The last glacial cycle was characterized by substantial millennial-scale climate fluctuations1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but the extent of any associated changes in global sea level (or, equivalently, ice volume) remains elusive. Highstands of sea level can be reconstructed from dated fossil coral reef terraces6, 7, and these data are complemented by a compilation of global sea-level estimates based on deep-sea oxygen isotope ratios at millennial-scale resolution8 or higher1. Records based on oxygen isotopes, however, contain uncertainties in the range of 30 m, or 1 C in deep sea temperature9, 10. Here we analyse oxygen isotope records from Red Sea sediment cores to reconstruct the history of water residence times in the Red Sea. We then use a hydraulic model of the water exchange between the Red Sea and the world ocean to derive the sill depthand hence global sea levelover the past 470,000 years (470 kyr). Our reconstruction is accurate to within 12 m, and gives a centennial-scale resolution from 70 to 25 kyr before present. We find that sea-level changes of up to 35 m, at rates of up to 2 cm yr-1, occurred, coincident with abrupt changes in climate.},

abstract = {We investigated microphytobenthic photosynthesis at four stations in the coral reef sediments at Heron Reef, Australia. The microphytobenthos was dominated by diatoms, dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria, as indicated by biomarker pigment analysis. Conspicuous algae firmly attached to the sand grains (ca. 100 ??m in diameter, surrounded by a hard transparent wall) were rich in peridinin, a marker pigment for dinoflagellates, but also showed a high diversity based on cyanobacterial 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis. Specimens of these algae that were buried below the photic zone exhibited an unexpected stimulation of respiration by light, resulting in an increase of local oxygen concentrations upon darkening. Net photosynthesis of the sediments varied between 1.9 and 8.5 mmol O2 m-2 h-1 and was strongly correlated with Chl a content, which lay between 31 and 84 mg m-2. An estimate based on our spatially limited dataset indicates that the microphytobenthic production for the entire reef is in the order of magnitude of the production estimated for corals. Photosynthesis stimulated calcification at all investigated sites (0.2-1.0 mmol Ca2+ m-2 h-1). The sediments of at least three stations were net calcifying. Sedimentary N2-fixation rates (measured by acetylene reduction assays at two sites) ranged between 0.9 to 3.9 mmol N2 m-2 h-1 and were highest in the light, indicating the importance of heterocystous cyanobacteria. In coral fingers no N2-fixation was measurable, which stresses the importance of the sediment compartment for reef nitrogen cycling. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Organic constituents isolated from the tests (shells) of six species of core-top planktonic foraminifera, ranging in age between 2 and 4 Ka BP, consist of a heterogeneous mixture of proteins and polypeptides. At least seven discrete polypeptides are present as indicated by reverse phase HPLC and by gel electrophoresis. High percentages of aspartic acid and glutamic acid characterize one class of protein, while glycine, serine, and alanine-rich proteins dominate in a second class. Similar HPLC Chromatographie elution profiles are observed for all species analyzed, varying only in intensity of the peaks and in amino acid composition from species to species. The approximate molecular weights of two major fossil proteins ranged between 50,000 and 70,000 daltons. A comparison of 2-4 and 300 Ka Bp samples shows that while most of the polypeptides are present in both samples, some acidic polypeptides are not present in the older sample. These data suggest that some of the acidic polypeptides may be more soluble than other fractions and are lost more quickly from the test. The remaining hydrophobic, possibly more insoluble, polypeptides may be preserved in much older specimens and may be useful in tracing phylogeny of the planktonic foraminifera. Amino acid analyses of total test extracts before and after dialysis demonstrate that some acidic amino acids, particularly aspartic acid, and possibly peptides less than 6000-8000 daltons are lost during dialysis. Although a large percentage of these components are undoubtedly from the original organic matrix, at this point adsorbed components cannot be ruled out. These data caution against the use of total amino acid compositions in biogeochemical studies. ?? 1990.},

abstract = {We report the results of laboratory and field studies examining inorganic carbon (C-i) utilization by Southern Ocean phytoplankton. Both in monospecific laboratory cultures of diatoms and Phaeocystis antarctica and in natural assemblages in the Ross Sea, Ci uptake by phytoplankton was dominated by direct HCO3- transport. The contribution of HCO3- transport to total Ci uptake ranged from 65{\%} to 95{\%}, with an overall average of similar to 80{\%}. There was no significant difference among diatoms and Phaeocystis in the extent of HCO3- transport. Extracellular carbonic anhydrase activity (eCA) was detected in eight of nine laboratory phytoplankton cultures and in all natural assemblages in the Ross Sea. The effective catalytic enhancement of HCO3- : CO2 interconversion ranged from 1.5- to 13-fold (overall mean similar to 4-fold). Diatom-dominated Ross Sea assemblages had significantly greater eCA levels than did Phaeocystis-dominated assemblages. We found no strong correlations between Ci uptake parameters and in situ CO2 concentrations or chlorophyll a levels in the Ross Sea assemblages. Incubation experiments with natural assemblages showed that HCO3- uptake and eCA expression did not change significantly over an 8-fold range in pCO(2) (10.1-81.1 Pa), although total short-term C fixation rates increased under low CO2 conditions. Carbon-concentrating mechanisms are widespread among Southern Ocean phytoplankton and constitutively expressed by natural assemblages in the Ross Sea.},

But quantitative prediction of crystal/melt partition coefficients from thermodynamic principles has not previously been possible. By studying the partitioning of 15 elements between silicate minerals and their coexisting melts, we show here that the partitioning behaviour of any series of isovalent cations can be rationalized in terms of a simple model in which the size and elasticity of the crystal lattice sites play a critical role. We find that elasticity varies linearly with the formal charge of the cation. This model allows us to predict element partitioning behav-iour solely from the physical characteristics of the cation sites in the crystal.},

abstract = {Measurements of B/Ca ratios in marine carbonates have been suggested to record seawater carbonate chemistry, however experimental calibration of such proxies based on inorganic partitioning remains limited. Here we conducted a series of synthetic aragonite precipitation experiments to evaluate the factors influencing the partitioning of B/Ca between aragonite and seawater. Our results indicate that the B/Ca ratio of synthetic aragonites depends primarily on the relative concentrations of borate and carbonate ions in the solution from which the aragonite precipitates; not on bicarbonate concentration as has been previously suggested. The influence of temperature was not significant over the range investigated (20-40 ??C), however, partitioning may be influenced by saturation state (and/or growth rate). Based on our experimental results, we suggest that aragonite B/Ca ratios can be utilized as a proxy of [CO32-]. Boron isotopic composition (??11B) is an established pH proxy, thus B/Ca and ??11B together allow the full carbonate chemistry of the solution from which the aragonite precipitated to be calculated. To the extent that aragonite precipitation by marine organisms is affected by seawater chemistry, B/Ca may also prove useful in reconstructing seawater chemistry. A simplified boron purification protocol based on amberlite resin and the organic buffer TRIS is also described.},

abstract = {The Dutch ethologist Niko Tinbergen famously distinguished between proximal and ultimate explanations in biology. Proximally, biologists seek a mechanistic understanding of how organisms function; most of this volume addresses the molecular and physiological bases of biomineralization. But while much of biology might be viewed as a particularly interesting form of chemistry, it is more than that. Biology is chemistry with a history, requiring that proximal explanations be grounded in ultimate, or evolutionary, understanding. The physiological pathways by which organisms precipitate skeletal minerals and the forms and functions of the skeletons they fashion have been shaped by natural selection through geologic time, and all have constrained continuing evolution in skeleton-forming clades. In this chapter, I outline some major patterns of skeletal evolution inferred from phylogeny and fossils (Figure 1⇓), highlighting ways that our improving mechanistic knowledge of biomineralization can help us to understand this evolutionary record (see Leadbetter and Riding 1986; Lowenstam and Weiner 1989; Carter 1990; and Simkiss and Wilbur 1989 for earlier reviews). Figure 1. A geologic time scale for the past 1000 million years, showing the principal time divisions used in Earth science and the timing of major evolutionary events discussed in this chapter. Earlier intervals of time—the Mesoproterozoic (1600–1000 million years ago) and Paleoproterozoic (2500–1600 million years ago) eras of the Proterozoic Eon and the Archean Eon ({\textgreater} 2500 million years ago)—are not shown. Time scale after Remane (2000). My discussion proceeds from two simple observations: Skeletal biomineralization requires energy and so imposes a metabolic cost on skeleton-forming organisms. Mineralized skeletons have evolved in many clades of protists, plants and animals. If both statements are true, then clearly for many but not all eukaryotic organisms the biological benefits of biomineralization must outweigh its costs. But cost-benefit ratio is not static.

abstract = {The bioavailability of nutrients represents one of the most important factors controlling the strength of the biological carbon pump and ultimately the impact of ocean biology on atmospheric CO2. Among those nutrients, the macro-nutrients nitrate (NO 2 - ) and phosphate (PO 4 -3 ) play a particularly important role in limiting biological productivity as evidenced by their often near complete exhaustion in surface waters. As near surface NO 2 - concentrations are generally somewhat lower than those of PO 4 -3 relative to the demand by phytoplankton, biological oceanographers have argued historically that NO 2 - rather than PO 4 -3 is the primary macro-nutrient controlling phytoplankton productivity[Smith, 1984; Codispoti, 1989; Tyrrell, 1999] . Geologists, in contrast, regarded PO 4 -3 as the primary controlling macronutrient[Codispoti, 1989]. They argued that while NO 2 - may indeed be the limiting factor at any given location and time, PO 4 -3 is truly the limiting factor on geological time-scales, because the biologically mediated fixation of the much more abundant dinitrogen gas (N2) into organic nitrogen is alleviating the scarcity of bioavailable nitrogen (Figure 1). Phosphate on the other hand, does not have such a biologically mediated source (Figure 1). It is therefore the geologically controlled balance between the riverine (and atmospheric) input of PO 4 -3 and its burial on the sea-floor that ultimately controls marine biological productivity. Tyrrell [ 1999] provided a synthesis of these two views by identifying NO 2 - as the proximate nutrient, while giving PO 4 -3 the role of being the ultimate nutrient.},

abstract = {We investigated the effects of spraying deltamethrin for tsetse fly control on bird populations in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. The northern part of the Delta was sprayed five times in 2001, and the southern part was sprayed five times in 2002. While deltamethrin is not particularly toxic to vertebrates, it is highly toxic to many types of insects. Therefore, we hypothesized that birds could be affected indirectly through reductions in their insect food supplies. We monitored resident bird populations using point counts at four sites (two sprayed in 2001 and two sprayed in 2002). We conducted 22 analyses of insectivorous bird numbers and four (18{\%}) of these showed declines, five (23{\%}) showed increases, and thirteen (59{\%}) showed no change. No insectivorous species declined at more than one study site. When insectivorous species were lumped as a guild, there were weak declines at one site but no changes at the other three sites. Our results indicate that spraying deltamethrin did not cause catastrophic population declines in insectivorous birds within a year. However, foraging behaviour, physiology, breeding success and longer-term population effects were not investigated and cannot be ruled out},

abstract = {The morphological and radiative properties of melt ponds on first-year sea ice (FYI) were investigated during the summer of 1997 in the Canadian Archipelago as part of the Collaborative-Interdisciplinary Cryospheric Experiment (C-ICE) near Resolute Bay, Nunavut. In this paper we (1) describe a classification technique used to identify surface cover types from airborne videography during the melt pond season, (2) use the classification results to examine the fractional coverage of surface types and morphological characteristics of melt ponds, and (3) provide an estimate of the integrated shortwave albedo of this surface. Cluster analysis on the videography data identified four distinct surface cover types during the summer melt season: snow, saturated snow, light-colored melt ponds, and dark-colored melt ponds. Melt pond coverage was found to be highly variable over our study area. We found that pond sizes tended to be twice as large in areas of high melt pond density compared to ponds in areas of low pond density owing to their interconnective nature, Video data also identified an elongated melt pond morphology pattern over the smoothest FYI within our study region. A derived estimate of the integrated shortwave albedo was strongly related to the fractional cover of snow on the surface (R-2 = 0.86). An analysis of combined fractional coverage of light and dark melt ponds from two aerial survey dates (Julian Days 181 and 184) revealed an aerial increase in melt ponds of similar to 10.3{\%}.},

Air exposure did not affect blood pressure or heart rate. Aquatic hypoxia did not affect blood pressure but transiently increased heart rate. In contrast, forced submersion significantly depressed heart rate throughout the period of submersion, while blood pressure decreased only transiently.

All investigated shells revealed anisotropic lattice distortions of the orthorhombic unit cell as compared to geological aragonite. Annealing at temperatures above 150-200 °C led to pronounced lattice relaxation which is accompanied by a substantial reduction of crystallite sizes and related growth of microstrain fluctuations. These findings indicate that biogenic aragonite crystals are strained, apparently, as a result of the amorphous/crystalline phase transformation, which proceeds within the supporting network of oriented biomacromolecules at early stages of biomineralization.},

abstract = {To test the possibility of inorganic carbon limitation of the marine unicellular alga Emiliania huxleyi (Lohmann) Hay and Mohler, its carbon acquisition was measured as a function of the different chemical species of inorganic carbon present in the medium. Because these different species are interdependent and covary in any experiment in which the speciation is changed, a set of experiments was performed to produce a multidimensional carbon uptake scheme for photosynthesis and calcification. This scheme shows that CO2 that is used for photosynthesis comes from two sources. The CO2 in seawater supports a modest rate of photosynthesis. The HCO is the major substrate for photosynthesis by intracellular production of CO2 (HCO+ H+→ CO2+ H2O → CH2O + O2). This use of HCO is possible because of the simultaneous calcification using a second HCO, which provides the required proton (HCO+ Ca2+→ CaCO3+ H+). The HCO is the only substrate for calcification. By distinguishing the two sources of CO2 used in photosynthesis, it was shown that E. huxleyi has a K½ for external CO2 of “only” 1.9 ± 0.5 $\mu$M (and a Vmax of 2.4 ± 0.1 pmol{\textperiodcentered}cell−1{\textperiodcentered}d−1). Thus, in seawater that is in equilibrium with the atmosphere ([CO2]= 14 $\mu$M, [HCO]= 1920 $\mu$M, at fCO2= 360 $\mu$atm, pH = 8, T = 15° C), photosynthesis is 90{\%} saturated with external CO2. Under the same conditions, the rate of photosynthesis is doubled by the calcification route of CO2 supply (from 2.1 to 4.5 pmol{\textperiodcentered}cell−1{\textperiodcentered}d−1). However, photosynthesis is not fully saturated, as calcification has a K½ for HCO of 3256 ± 1402 $\mu$M and a Vmax of 6.4 ± 1.8 pmol{\textperiodcentered}cell−1{\textperiodcentered}d−1. The H+ that is produced during calcification is used with an efficiency of 0.97 ± 0.08, leading to the conclusion that it is used intracellularly. A maximum efficiency of 0.88 can be expected, as NO uptake generates a H+ sink (OH− source) for the cell. The success of E. huxleyi as a coccolithophorid may be related to the efficient coupling between H+ generation in calcification and CO2 fixation in photosynthesis.},

Satellite remote-sensing data of ice elevations and ice motion show significant ice loss in the range of −31 to −196 Gt yr−1 in West Antarctica in recent years1, 2, 3, 4, whereas East Antarctica seems to remain in balance or slightly gain mass1, 2, 4, with estimated rates of mass change in the range of −4 to 22 Gt yr−1. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment5 (GRACE) offers the opportunity of quantifying polar ice-sheet mass balance from a different perspective6, 7. Here we use an extended record of GRACE data spanning the period April 2002 to January 2009 to quantify the rates of Antarctic ice loss. In agreement with an independent earlier assessment4, we estimate a total loss of 190±77 Gt yr−1, with 132±26 Gt yr−1 coming from West Antarctica. However, in contrast with previous GRACE estimates, our data suggest that East Antarctica is losing mass, mostly in coastal regions, at a rate of −57±52 Gt yr−1, apparently caused by increased ice loss since the year 2006.},

The article is structured into three major sections, beginning in section 2with a discussion of the principal strategies that can be used to control the morphologies of amorphous and crystalline materials. Biominerals provide a wonderful demonstration of how mineral morphologies can be modified under ambient conditions to produce some truly remarkable forms, and section 3 will examine the biological strategies applied to achieve this. Finally, section 4 describes the application of biomimetic pathways to the formation of minerals with controlled morphologies. Within each of these sections, the morphological controls of amorphous, polycrys- talline, and single-crystal solids are addressed separately. While some overlap is inevitable between these topics, separation of the discussion into their three main areas facilitates a compre- hensive discussion of potential strategies for controllingmineral morphologies.

First-principles XANES calculations are performed for minerals using a plane-wave density functional formalism with core-hole effects treated in a supercell approach. The good agreement obtained between experimental and theo- retical spectra provides useful information to interpret the spectral features. With the help of calculation, the position of the first peak of XANES spectra is related to both coordination and polyhedron distortion changes. In alumino-silicate glasses, magnesium is found to be mainly 5-fold coordinated to oxygen whatever the aluminum saturation index value. In silicate glasses, magnesium coordination increases from 4 in Cs-, Rb- and K-bearing glasses to 5 in Na- and Li-bearing glasses but remains equal as the polymerization degree of the glass varies. The variation of the C feature (position and intensity) is strongly related to the alkali type providing information on the medium range order.},

Field data were collected as part of the international Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) program, and from historical time series stations. The field data include a wide variety of marine ecosystem types, including nitrogen- and iron-limited systems, and different physical environments from high latitudes to the mid-ocean gyres. Model output is generally in good agreement with field data from these diverse ecosystems. These results imply that the ecosystem model presented here can be reliably applied over the global domain. The model includes multiple potentially limiting nutrients that regulate phytoplankton growth rates. There are three phytoplankton classes, diatoms, diazotrophs, and a generic small phytoplankton class. Growth rates can be limited by available nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and/or light levels. The diatoms can also be limited by silicon. The diazotrophs are capable of nitrogen fixation of N2 gas and cannot be nitrogen-limited. Calcification by phytoplankton is parameterized as a variable fraction of primary production by the small phytoplankton group. There is one zooplankton class that grazes the three phytoplankton groups and a large detrital pool. The large detrital pool sinks out of the mixed layer, while a smaller detrital pool, representing dissolved organic matter and very small particulates, does not sink. Remineralization of the detrital pools is parameterized with a temperature-dependent function. We explicitly model the dissolved iron cycle in marine surface waters including inputs of iron from subsurface sources and from atmospheric dust deposition. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The packing of the ferrocene guest molecules inside MIL-47(V) is significantly different compared to MIL-53(Al) due to the lower breathing effect and weaker hydrogen bonds between the guest molecules and the host network in the case of MIL-47(V). The orientation of the metallocene molecule is also influenced by the substituents (CH3 and CHO) at the cyclopentadienyl ring and the interaction with the bridging OH group of MIL-53(Al). The inclusion of redox active cobaltocene into MIL-47(V) leads to the formation of a charge transfer compound with a negatively charged framework. The reduction of the vanadium centers is stoichiometric. The resulting material is a mixed valence compound with a V3+/V4+ ratio of 1 : 1. The new compounds were characterized via thermal gravimetric analysis, infrared spectroscopy, solid state NMR, and differential pulse voltammetry. Both systems are 1D-channel pore structures. The metallocene adsorbate induced breathing effect of MIL-53(Al) is more pronounced compared to MIL-47(V), this can be explained by the different bridging groups between the MO6 clusters.},

abstract = {Rapidly rising levels of atmospheric CO 2 are not only causing ocean warming, but also lowering seawater pH hence the carbonate saturation state of the oceans, on which many marine organisms depend to calcify their skeletons. Using boron isotope systematics, we show how scleractinian corals up-regulate pH at their site of calcification such that internal changes are approximately one-half of those in ambient seawater. This species-dependent pH-buffering capacity enables aragonitic corals to raise the saturation state of their calcifying medium, thereby increasing calcification rates at little additional energy cost. Using a model of pH regulation combined with abiotic calcification, we show that the enhanced kinetics of calcification owing to higher temperatures has the potential to counter the effects of ocean acidification. Up-regulation of pH, however, is not ubiquitous among calcifying organisms; those lacking this ability are likely to undergo severe declines in calcification as CO 2 levels increase. The capacity to up-regulate pH is thus central to the resilience of calcifiers to ocean acidification, although the fate of zooxanthellate corals ultimately depends on the ability of both the photosymbionts and coral host to adapt to rapidly increasing ocean temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Rodriguez-navarro2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society.The formation of calcite (CaCO3), the most abundant carbonate mineral on Earth and a common biomineral, has been the focus of numerous studies. While recent research underlines the importance of nonclassical crystallization pathways involving amorphous precursors, direct evidence is lacking regarding the actual mechanism of calcite growth via an amorphous phase. Here we show, using in situ atomic force microscopy and complementary techniques, that faceted calcite can grow via a nonclassical particle-mediated colloidal crystal growth mechanism that at the nanoscale mirrors classical ion-mediated growth, and involves a layer-by-layer attachment of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) nanoparticles, followed by their restructuring and fusion with the calcite substrate in perfect crystallographic registry. The ACC-to-calcite transformation occurs by an interface-coupled dissolution-reprecipitation mechanism and obliterates or preserves the nanogranular texture of the colloidal growth layer in the absence or presence of organic (macro)molecules, respectively. These results show that, in addition to classical ion-mediated crystal growth, a particle-mediated growth mechanism involving colloidal epitaxy may operate in the case of an inorganic crystal such as calcite. The gained knowledge may shed light on the mechanism of CaCO3 biomineralization, and should open new ways for the rational design of novel biomimetic functional nanomaterials.},

@article{Fabricius2011,
abstract = {Experiments have shown that ocean acidification due to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations has deleterious effects on the performance of many marine organisms 1–4 . However, few empirical or modelling studies have addressed the long-term consequences of ocean acidification for marine ecosystems 5–7 . Here we show that as pH declines from 8.1 to 7.8 (the change expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from 390 to 750 ppm, consistent with some scenarios for the end of this century) some organisms benefit, but many more lose out. We investigated coral reefs, seagrasses and sediments that are acclimatized to low pH at three cool and shallow volcanic carbon dioxide seeps in Papua New Guinea. At reduced pH, we observed reductions in coral diversity, recruitment and abundances of structurally complex framework builders, and shifts in competitive interactions between taxa. However, coral cover remained constant between pH 8.1 and ∼7.8, because massive Porites corals established dominance over structural corals, despite low rates of calcification. Reef development ceased below pH 7.7. Our empirical data from this unique field setting confirm model predictions that ocean acidification, together with temperature stress, will probably lead to severely reduced diversity, structural complexity and resilience of Indo-Pacific coral reefs within this century. Rising atmospheric CO 2 from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation affects marine systems in several ways. Through its effect on the global climate, it increases sea surface temperatures (now 0.7 • C higher than in pre-industrial times) and intensifies storm and rainfall variability, altering salinity and the terrestrial runoff of nutrients and sediments 8 . It also causes profound changes in sea water chemistry. Atmospheric CO 2 concentrations of ∼390 ppm already exceed by 50–100{\%} the historic envelope of 200–300 ppm in the past {\textgreater}2 million years 9 . The resulting increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2) in sea water has already reduced mean surface seawater pH by 0.1, thus lowering carbonate ion concentrations by 30 µmol kg −1 , and the saturation state of sea water for calcium carbonate minerals (Ω) by ∼15{\%}, although the magnitude of these effects varies regionally and with latitude 1,5,10,11 . The declining pH, termed 'ocean acidification', is predicted to have profound implications for marine ecosystems because carbonate ions are an essential substrate for biotic calcification. Coral reefs are of particular concern because their many tens of thousands of species ultimately depend on the structural complexity derived from the corals' carbonate skeletons 5,6 . However, specific knowledge about the capacity of reef ecosystems to acclimatize and/or adapt to long-term exposure to lowered pH (increased pCO 2 and reduced Ω) remains inadequate. Much of our understanding stems from short-term laboratory perturbation experiments of individual organisms or from deterministic models. Perturbation experiments report variable and sometimes severe responses in many marine plants, invertebrates and vertebrates at lowered pH, such as declining calcification, altered physiologies and some effects on survival 2–4 . Although laboratory experiments are indispensable, most are too brief for full organism acclimatization to occur, and co-limiting factors (for example nutrients, currents and irradiance) are difficult to simulate ex situ 12,13 . Experiments also provide little information about processes leading to ecosystem adaptation, such as altered reproduction, competition, food webs and disease susceptibility, or genetic adaptation. There is therefore a great need for empirical data documenting the long-term effects of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems acclimatized to high pCO 2 , as found around submarine CO 2 vents. Recently, changes in shallow-water marine rocky shore ecosystems have been investigated at volcanic CO 2 vents in the Mediterranean, documenting major declines in many calcifying and non-calcifying organisms and increases in macroalgae and seagrasses at reduced seawater pH (refs 7,14). Here we report the effects of natural in situ exposure to elevated seawater pCO 2 on tropical coral reef communities, coral growth, recruitment, seagrasses and sedimentary properties. The study is based on field investigations of clear-water coral reefs and seagrass communities around three cool volcanic seeps of ∼99{\%} CO 2 gas, and at three adjacent control sites with similar geomorphology, seawater temperature and salinity, that fringe the D'Entrecastraux Islands, Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea (Supplementary Figs S1, S2, Table S1). Coral communities at 3 m depth were compared between control sites ('low pCO 2 ': bubble streams {\textgreater}5 m from the transect lines, medians per site 7.97–8.14 pH at total scale, 296–494 ppm pCO 2) and reef sections with moderate seep activity ('high pCO 2 ': bubble streams {\textless}5 m from the transect lines, pH 7.73–8.00, 444–953 ppm pCO 2 ; Fig. 1a,b, Supplementary Fig. S3, Table S2). The median saturation state of sea water for the calcium carbonate mineral aragonite (Ω arag) was 3.5 at the control sites and 2.9 at the seeps. The zones of most vigorous venting were covered by sand or rocks with individual coral colonies, macroalgae or dense seagrass (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. S4). No reef development was found at a pH less than 7.70 ({\textgreater}1,000 ppm CO 2), and hence the most intensely venting zones were excluded from the reef assessment. The field surveys showed that at high compared with low pCO 2 sites, hard coral cover was similar (33{\%} versus 31{\%}; Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table S3). However, the cover of massive Porites},

abstract = {The carbon cycle has a central role in climate change. For example, during glacial–interglacial cycles, atmospheric carbon dioxide has altered radiative forcing and amplified temperature changes. However, it is unclear how sensitive the climate system has been to changes in carbon cycling in previous geological periods, or how this sensitivity may evolve in the future, following massive anthropogenic emissions. Here we develop an analytical relationship that links the variation of radiative forcing from changes in carbon dioxide concentrations with changes in air–sea carbon cycling on a millennial timescale.We find that this relationship is affected by the ocean storage of carbon and its chemical partitioning in sea water. Our analysis reveals that the radiative forcing of climate is more sensitive to carbon perturbations now than it has been over much of the preceding 400 million years. This high sensitivity is likely to persist into the future as the oceans become more acidic and the bulk of the fossil-fuels inventory is transferred to the ocean and atmosphere.},

abstract = {Partitioning of strontium during spontaneous calcite formation was experimentally studied using an advanced CO2-diffusion technique. Results at different precipitation rates and T = 5, 25, and 40 °C show that at constant temperature Sr incorporation into calcite is controlled by the precipitation rate (R in $\mu$mol/m2/h) according to the individual expressions(log DSr = (0.319 ± 0.042) {\textperiodcentered} log R - 1.80 ± 0.11; log DSr = (0.214 ± 0.026) {\textperiodcentered} log R - 1.67 ± 0.09; log DSr = (0.095 ± 0.031) {\textperiodcentered} log R - 1.42 ± 0.09)at 5, 25, and 40 °C, respectively. High rates induce less Sr partitioning (i.e., high Sr distribution coefficients of Sr) in calcite (DSr). DSr value and rate dependency decreases with increasing temperature. This indicates that effect of R is more significant at lower T. Both R and DSr are also apparently influenced by solution chemistry (i.e., pH). The strontium incorporation behavior during precipitation of calcite can be reasonably explained by the Surface Entrapment Model (SEMO) adapted from Watson and Liang (Watson E. B. and Liang Y. (1995) A simple model for sector zoning in slowly grown crystals: implications for growth rate and lattice diffusion, with emphasis on accessory minerals in crustal rocks. Am. Miner. 80, 1179-1187). According to SEMO Sr is significantly enriched in the surface layer of the growing calcite. Sr incorporation into the final calcite crystal lattice depends on the estimated value of the Sr entrapment factor for the surface layer, crystal growth kinetics, and ion diffusion behavior within the proposed surface layer. SEMO is a valid theoretical concept to elucidate mechanisms and kinetics of Sr incorporation into inorganic calcite within the range of the experimental conditions used in this study. Accordingly, apparent DSr values in natural and applied systems can be used as an environmental proxy for inorganic calcite growth behavior at the present aqueous molar Sr/Ca ratios between 0.01 and 0.00006. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In maize endosperm, genes encoding the 22-kD zein class of storage proteins are regulated by the OPAQUE2 locus. The Opaque2 (02) protein shares homology with the basic domainlleucine zipper class of transcriptional activators. Using microprojectile bombardment, we have shown that 0 2 is capable of transactivating a 22-kD zein promoter in maize en-dosperm suspension cultures and in longitudinal sections of intact endosperm. Two mutant forms of the 02 gene were constructed by deleting regions that encode either the basic domain or the first 175 N-terminal residues.of the 0 2 protein. When either of these mutant 02 genes was coexpressed with wild-type 02 in a maize endosperm expression system, 02-mediated transactivation of the 22-kD zein promoter was inhibited specifically and in a dose-dependent manner. Elec-trophoretic mobility shift assays and immunoprecipitation studies indicated that the mutant 0 2 proteins form heterodimers with wild-type 0 2 in vitro. The mutant lacking the basic domain forms heterodimers with wild-type 02, which can no longer bind DNA. In contrast, the product of the N-terminal truncation allele forms homodimers and heterodimers with wild-type 02, both of which can still bind DNA. Because the N-terminal region contains an activation domain, it is likely that these latter complexes are deficient in transactivation. Dominant negative inhibitors of gene expression, such as those constructed here, provide an alternative to antisense RNA approaches for inactivation of gene function in plants.},

abstract = {Particulate organic carbon (POC) is vertically transported to the oceanic interior by aggregates and their ballasts, mainly CaCO3 and biogenic opal, with a smaller role for lithogenic aerosols through the mesopelagic zone. Diel migrating zooplankton communities effect vertical transport and remineralization of POC in the upper layers of the ocean. Below 1.5 km, the presence of zooplankton is reduced and thus the aggregates travel mainly by gravitational transport. We normalized the fluxes of POC, CaCO3, and biogenic opal from data published on samples collected at 134 globally distributed, bottom-tethered, time-series sediment trap (TS-trap) stations to annual mole fluxes at the mesopelagic/bathypelagic boundary (m/b) at 2 km and defined them as Fm/bCorg, Fm/bCinorg, and Fm/bSibio. Using this global data set, we investigated (1) the geographic contrasts of POC export at m/b and (2) the supply rate of ???CO2 to the world mesopelagic water column. Fm/bCorg varies from 25 (Pacific Warm Pool) to 605 (divergent Arabian Sea) mmolC m-2 yr-1; Fm/bCinorg varies from {\textgreater}8 (high latitude Polar Oceans) or 15 (Pacific Warm Pool) to 459 (divergent Arabian Sea) mmolC m-2 yr-1; and Fm/bSibio, the most spatially/temporally variable flux, ranges from 6 (North Atlantic Drift) to 1118 (Pacific Subarctic Gyre) mmolSi m-2 yr-1. The oceanic region exhibiting the highest POC flux over a significantly large region is the area of the North Pacific Boreal Gyres where the average Fm/bCorg = 213, Fm/bCinorg = 126, and Fm/bSibio = 578 mmol m-2 yr-1. Fm/bCorg and Fm/bCinorg are particularly high in large upwelling margins, including the divergent Arabian Sea and off Cape Verde. One of the data sets showing the lowest flux over a significant region/basin is Fm/bCorg = 39, Fm/bCinorg = 69, and Fm/bSibio = 22 mmol m-2 yr-1 in the North Pacific subtropical/tropical gyres; Pan-Atlantic average fluxes are similar except Fm/bSibio fluxes are even lower.

The total global annual fluxes of Fm/bCorg, Fm/bCinorg, and Fm/bSibio at m/b calculated by parameterizations of the export flux data from 134 stations are surprisingly similar; 36.2, 33.8, and 34.6 teramol yr-1 (120, 112, and 114 mmol m-2 yr-1), respectively, resulting in a near uniform binary ratio between the above three elements of about one. The global ternary {\%} ratios estimated from 152 TS-trap samples of the three elements are 35:32:33. From our global Fm/bCorg and a published model estimate of the global export production, we estimate the regeneration rate of CO2 through the mesopelagic zone by the biological pump is 441 teramolC yr-1. Based on our global Fm/bCinorg and recently estimated global primary production of PIC, 36-86 teramolC yr-1 of PIC is assumed to be dissolved within the upper 2 km of the water column. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Carbon fixation of Emiliania huxleyi was studied in light-limited, steady-state, continuous cultures. Six growth rates were examined ranging from 0.24 to 1.0 d(-1) although the lowest may have been carbon-limited. Cell-specific and chlorophyll-specific rates of photosynthesis and calcification increased as a function of growth rate. The ratio of calcification to photosynthesis (C/P) increased from about 0.2 to 0.7 as the growth rate increased (from 0.24 to 0.75 d(-1)), then the C/P ratio decreased slightly as the growth rate approached washout at 1 d(-1). Extrapolation of the regression data at low growth rates suggested that there should be zero calcification at a growth rate of about 0.1 d(-1). Cells were also given a 30 s acidification/neutralization treatment to dissolve their coccoliths, and then carbon fixation was measured. Photosynthesis and calcification at all growth rates increased by about 0.1 pg C cell(-1) h(-1) following this treatment. Carbon fixation per unit chlorophyll a was predicted by multiplying the total carbon:chlorophyll a ratio by the respective culture dilution rate. These predictions were almost identical to C-14 measurements of carbon fixation per unit chlorophyll. Nevertheless, if only total carbon incorporation data are available for a coccolithophore population, accurate predictions of just photosynthesis or calcification will require the function (presented in this paper) which relates the C/P ratio to growth rate. This function suggests a decoupling of photosynthesis from calcification as growth becomes progressively more light-limited.},

abstract = {Understanding spatial variability of soil properties in response to land-use impacts is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of measures taken to address diffuse water pollution from agriculture. However, despite the growing emphasis on integrated catchment-scale implementation of land-use mitigation measures, the baseline landscape-scale evaluation of the spatial variability of key soil nutrients remains scarce. This study employs a high resolution geostatistical approach to characterise the spatial variability of parameters, including soil bulk density (BD), total soil carbon (TC), nitrogen (TN), phosphorus (TP), inorganic phosphorus (IP), organic phosphorus (OP), stable nitrogen isotope ratio (??15N), C:N ratio, carbon storage and nitrogen storage in two study catchments with contrasting land uses (agricultural and semi-natural) that are subject to targeted management interventions to reduce flood risk and improve water quality. We found a stronger degree of spatial dependence of all soil properties in the agricultural than the semi-natural catchment, except for bulk density and ??15N. Furthermore, bulk density, TP, IP, OP, C:N ratio, ??15N and carbon storage showed a longer range or spatial auto-correlation in the agricultural catchment. The central tendency (median and mean) of all soil properties was also significantly different between the two catchments, with the exception of IP and ??15N. The spatial correlations between the soil properties pointed to the mechanisms that were responsible for the observed differences, whilst the krigged surfaces of soil variables identified most likely critical source areas for targeted land management interventions to improve water quality. Arable and intensive grasslands were identified as 'high-impact' land uses, associated with negative alteration of soil properties and increased diffuse water pollution, whilst moorland was a 'low impact' land use associated with improved water quality. A comparison with the national soil survey dataset shows that whilst it can be relied upon for the broad characterisation of carbon and TP stocks in the two study catchments, it underestimates the spatial variability of key soil properties in certain soil types and land uses. As the restoration of soil spatial heterogeneity may take several decades, a high resolution geostatistical approach should be included in the future design of catchment-scale monitoring schemes to inform catchment management strategies and elucidate the time frame over which landscape scale improvements in soil properties and corresponding ecosystem services can be achieved. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Dutch ethologist Niko Tinbergen famously distinguished between proximal and ultimate explanations in biology. Proximally, biologists seek a mechanistic understanding of how organisms function; most of this volume addresses the molecular and physiological bases of biomineralization. But while much of biology might be viewed as a particularly interesting form of chemistry, it is more than that. Biology is chemistry with a history, requiring that proximal explanations be grounded in ultimate, or evolutionary, understanding. The physiological pathways by which organisms precipitate skeletal minerals and the forms and functions of the skeletons they fashion have been shaped by natural selection through geologic time, and all have constrained continuing evolution in skeleton-forming clades. In this chapter, I outline some major patterns of skeletal evolution inferred from phylogeny and fossils (Figure 1⇓), highlighting ways that our improving mechanistic knowledge of biomineralization can help us to understand this evolutionary record (see Leadbetter and Riding 1986; Lowenstam and Weiner 1989; Carter 1990; and Simkiss and Wilbur 1989 for earlier reviews). Figure 1. A geologic time scale for the past 1000 million years, showing the principal time divisions used in Earth science and the timing of major evolutionary events discussed in this chapter. Earlier intervals of time—the Mesoproterozoic (1600–1000 million years ago) and Paleoproterozoic (2500–1600 million years ago) eras of the Proterozoic Eon and the Archean Eon ({\textgreater} 2500 million years ago)—are not shown. Time scale after Remane (2000). My discussion proceeds from two simple observations: Skeletal biomineralization requires energy and so imposes a metabolic cost on skeleton-forming organisms. Mineralized skeletons have evolved in many clades of protists, plants and animals. If both statements are true, then clearly for many but not all eukaryotic organisms the biological benefits of biomineralization must outweigh its costs. But cost-benefit ratio is not static. It will change through {\ldots}},

abstract = {A sediment core from Southampton Water, a coastal plain estuary, has been investigated and is shown to provide a record of pollution following the expansion of the Fawley oil refinery in 1949-1951. A combination of heavy metal analyses, the first appearance of hydrocarbon contamination, radiometric dating, and stable Pb isotope ratios have been used to interpret the pollution history in the core. Indications are that following dredging activities, accompanying the refinery expansion, there was a relatively rapid sedimentation rate of ca. 20 mm p.a., which decreased with time to approximately 5 mm p.a. The higher accumulation rate is attributed to the response of the estuary following the major capital dredging works that occurred in 1950-1951. The accumulation rates are used to recalculate concentration profiles to reveal the heavy metal flux to the sediments. Lead isotope data indicate a significant post-1950 use of lead derived from ancient, non-U.K. (Precambrian) ores in local industry.},

Two full-scale applications were undertaken in the summer of 2001/2002 in the impounded riverine section of two estuaries along the coastal plain of south west Western Australia. Both rivers are subject to blue-green algal blooms in the summer months. Phoslock(TM) applied in a slurry from a small boat reduced dissolved P in the water column to below detection limit in the few hours it took for the clay to settle and substantially reduced P efflux from the sediments during the course of the trial. The effect of P reduction on phytoplankton growth was clearly evident in the phytoplankton dominated Vasse River but was less clear in the alternating phytoplankton to aquatic plant dominated Canning River which is also subject to surface nutrient inputs.},

This paper summarises the major cellular fluxes of substrates and products of calcification described in a simple four compartment model (cytosol, Golgi, coccolith vesicle and chloroplast). Measurements of the cytosolic and intra-coccolith vesicle pH and electrical potentials across the plasma membrane and coccolith vesicle membrane allow calculations of the proton electrochemical gradients across these membranes and estimates of the free carbonate and calcium concentrations in the coccolith vesicle. Calcification may provide a relatively low cost route for elevating the concentration of carbon dioxide in the chloroplast. This may have benefits in terms of the nutrient requirements for photosynthesis and growth. In particular, a close relationship appears to exist between calcification and the availability of phosphorus which may correlate with the occurrence of large scale blooms of Emiliania huxleyi in the North Atlantic.},

abstract = {In army ants, prey items are often retrieved by cooperative teams of workers rather than by single porters. We used experiments and randomization tests to explore the division of labour within such teams in the New World army ant Eciton burchelli, and the Old World army ant Dorylus wilverthi. We evaluated these teams in the light of a recent proposal that teams should be defined in terms of the concurrent performance of different subtasks by their members. This is a broader and more useful definition of teams than a previous one in which teams were defined by amembership necessarily involving different castes. Within army ant teams there is a front runner who initiates prey retrieval and one or more followers. Hence, there are two qualitatively different subtasks that must be performed concurrently during such teamwork. Previous work has shown that these teams are superefficient: the combined weight of the prey retrieved by the team is greater than the sum of the maximum weights the team members could carry when working singly. Here we show, for both species of army ant, that such teams have a nonrandom composition of members. The front runner is typically unusually large and the second-largest ant in a team is typically unusually small. These analyses are based on worker dry weights rather than assigning workers to discrete caste categories. Our analysis also suggests that the behaviour of army ants is more sophisticated then previously suspected. Our data imply that if an unnecessarily large supplementary ant (follower) tries to help the front runner to move a large prey item, but finds that the remaining work is too slight to use her full efforts, she does not join the team. One or more smaller ants whose efforts become fully employed become involved instead. This suggests that army ants engaged in teamwork have both upper and lower workload thresholds.},

abstract = {At Ocean Station P (50??N 145??W) in the open subarctic Pacific Ocean recent estimates of phytoplankton production rate were consistently much higher than those obtained during previous decades of weathership operations. Moreover, the production was supported to a major extent by regenerated forms of nitrogen despite high concentrations of NO3. An ecosystem process model, simulating the interactions among phytoplankton, herbivorous microzooplankton and nutrients, was used to evaluate the possible mechanisms underlying both the high production rates and the patterns of utilization of dissolved nitrogenous nutrients. The model results suggest that at Station P the phytoplankton have specific growth rates expected for the ambient light and temperature regime, and furthermore that two processes, grazing control of phytoplankton stock and preferential utilization of NH4 by the phytoplankton, can account for the continuously low standing stock of phytoplankton and the underutilization of NO3 in the surface layer in summer. However, moderate limitation of phytoplankton specific growth rate by a trace nutrient such as dissolved iron cannot be ruled out. Winter observations of plankton dynamics at Station P would afford a strong test of the model predictions. In addition, the model highlights several properties of the subarctic Pacific epipelagic ecosystem in need of further investigation. These include possible trace nutrient limitation of maximum specific growth rate of the phytoplankton assemblage; the abundance, types and physiological characteristics of microzooplankton grazers; the sources and intensity of predatory mortality of grazers; effects of daily variability of physical processes on plankton dynamics; and control of growth rates of individual phytoplankton species, especially microphytoplankters whose specific growth rates may be limited by availability of trace nutrients. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {In order to apply Sr/Ca and 44Ca/ 40Ca fractionation during calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) formation as a proxy to reconstruct paleo-environments, it is essential to evaluate the impact of various environmental factors. In this study, a CO 2 diffusion technique was used to crystallize inorganic calcite from aqueous solutions at different ionic strength/salinity by the addition of NaCl at 25??C. Results show that the discrimination of Sr 2+ versus Ca 2+ during calcite formation is mainly controlled by precipitation rate (R in ??mol/m 2/h) and is weakly influenced by ionic strength/salinity. In analogy to Sr incorporation, 44Ca/ 40Ca fractionation during precipitation of calcite is weakly influenced by ionic strength/salinity too. At 25??C the calcium isotope fractionation between calcite and aqueous calcium ions (?? 44/40Ca calcite-aq=?? 44/40Ca calcite-?? 44/40Ca aq) correlates inversely to logR values for all experiments. In addition, an inverse relationship between ?? 44/40Ca calcite-aq and logD Sr, which is independent of temperature, precipitation rate, and aqueous (Sr/Ca) aq ratio, is not affected by ionic strength/salinity either. Considering the logD Sr and ?? 44/40Ca calcite-aq relationship, Sr/Ca and ?? 44/40Ca calcite values of precipitated calcite can be used as an excellent multi-proxy approach to reconstruct environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, precipitation rate) of calcite growth and diagenetic alteration. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Strontium and Mg in calcite and aragonite are widely used as proxies of temperature in palaeo-environmental reconstructions. We use X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) to examine Sr and Mg substitution in calcite and aragonite. We have measured the K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of Mg and Sr-bearing calcite and aragonite, plus the carbonates: strontianite, hydromagnesite, magnesite, dolomite and a suite of calcites with differing amounts of Mg. The Sr substitutes ideally for Ca in aragonite but causes a small (2{\%}) dilation of the site. Strontium substitutes for octahedral Ca in calcite but with a 6.5{\%} dilation and distortion. Magnesium in the calcites studied provides a variable XANES indicating that the Mg structural state in calcite is variable. Refinement of EXAFS gives Mg-O bond distances of similar to 2.12 angstrom, which are much smaller than the Ca-O bond distance of 2.35 angstrom but consistent with published amounts of relaxation of the calcite structure. The XANES and EXAFS are consistent with a model whereby some calcites contain natrodomains, e.g. of dolomite and/or huntite structures. The variability in the XANES can be explained by domains of different types and/or sizes. Substitution of Mg into aragonite has 9-fold coordination but relatively short bond distances (2.'08 angstrom) demonstrating either: (1) substantial distortion of the site; or (2) that Mg is accommodated in nanodomains of an unknown phase. Variability in the Mg structural state in calcite may be linked to the variety of temperature dependences observed, e.g. in foraminiferal calcite.},

Pollution effects were localized and difficult to assess because of a rigorous physical environment. Mesohaline and oligohaline communities were very similar to those in other estuaries of the eastern United States. Macrobenthic densities were most severely depressed in tidal freshwater habitats near Richmond {\&} Hopewell, where the major portion of the pollution load enters the river. Cluster analysis of species distributional patterns and ordination of pollution and physical parameters produced similar results, dividing the river into mesohaline, oligohaline, and upper and lower tidal freshwater zones. Further analysis of only the tidal freshwater portion indicated the distribution of benthic communities reflected the location and concentration of pollution sources along the river. Tidal freshwater communities were dominated by the Asiatic clam, Corbicula fluminea, tubificid oligochaetes of the genus Limnodrilus and the chironomid insect larva Coelotanypus scapularis. The fauna of the freshwater zones was very eurytopic with respect to sediment type and has a great resemblance to the fauna of eutrophic lakes. The classical concept of a sharp increase in number of species occurring from oligohaline to freshwater zones was found to be misleading. This increase does not occur until free flowing (or lotic) freshwater areas of greater habitat diversity are reached.},

abstract = {[1] The effect of elevated pCO(2) on the metabolism of a coral reef community dominated by macroalgae has been investigated utilizing the large 2650 m 3 coral reef mesocosm at the Biosphere-2 facility near Tucson, Arizona. The carbonate chemistry of the water was manipulated to simulate present-day and a doubled CO2 future condition. Each experiment consisted of a 1-2 month preconditioning period followed by a 7-9 day observational period. The pCO(2) was 404 +/- 63 muatm during the present-day pCO(2) experiment and 658 +/- 59 matm during the elevated pCO(2) experiment. Nutrient levels were low and typical of natural reefs waters (NO3- 0.5-0.9 muM, NH4+ 0.4 muM, PO43- 0.07-0.09 muM). The temperature and salinity of the water were held constant at 26.5 +/- 0.2degreesC and 34.4 +/- 0.2 ppt. Photosynthetically available irradiance was 10 +/- 2 during the present-day experiment and 7.4 +/- 0.5 mol photons m(-2) d(-1) during the elevated pCO(2) experiment. The primary producer biomass in the mesocosm was dominated by four species of macroalgae; Haptilon cubense, Amphiroa fragillisima, Gelidiopsis intricata and Chondria dasyphylla. Algal biomass was 10.4 mol C m(-2) during the present-day and 8.7 mol C m(-2) and during the elevated pCO(2) experiments. As previously observed, the increase in pCO(2) resulted in a decrease in calcification from 0.041 +/- 0.007 to 0.006 +/- 0.003 mol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1). Net community production (NCP) and dark respiration did not change in response to elevated pCO(2). Light respiration measured by a new radiocarbon isotope dilution method exceeded dark respiration by a factor of 1.2 +/- 0.3 to 2.1 +/- 0.4 on a daily basis and by 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 3.9 +/- 0.8 on an hourly basis. The 1.8-fold increase with increasing pCO(2) indicates that the enhanced respiration in the light was not due to photorespiration. Gross production (GPP) computed as the sum of NCP plus daily respiration (light + dark) increased significantly (0.24 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.32 +/- 0.04 mol C m(-2) d(-1)). However, the conventional calculation of GPP based on the assumption that respiration in the light proceeds at the same rate as the dark underestimated the true rate of GPP by 41-100{\%} and completely missed the increased rate of carbon cycling due to elevated pCO(2). We conclude that under natural, undisturbed, nutrient-limited conditions elevated CO2 depresses calcification, stimulates the rate of turnover of organic carbon, particularly in the light, but has no effect on net organic production. The hypothesis that an increase pCO(2) would produce an increase in net production that would counterbalance the effect of decreasing saturation state on calcification is not supported by these data.},

abstract = {Freshwater and marine cultured pearls form via identical processes to the shells of bivalves and can therefore serve as models for the biomineralization of bivalve shells in general. Their nanostructure consists of membrane-coated granules (vesicles) which contain amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) at the beginning of the biomineralization sequence, preceding the crystallization of aragonite and vaterite. In contrast to the commonly accepted view, crystallization of ACC occurs rapidly and within the granular nano-compartments mediated by organic molecules much earlier than platelet formation. The interlamellar organic sheets in nacre that form the platelet structure of nacre themselves form by self-organization after the crystallization process of CaCO3 is completed and, thus, cannot serve as a nucleation template for aragonite. Pores in the organic sheets are postulated to be a result of this process rather than to represent the pathways for CaCO3 through pre-existing interlamellar sheets. The amorphous phase has the highest concentrations of Mg (5.8 mol{\%}), Mn (6.6 mol{\%}), S (4.7 mol{\%}) and P (1 mol{\%}) of the three CaCO3-polymorphs. Mg/Ca and Mn/Ca ratios are found to decrease in the order ACC {\textgreater} vaterite {\textgreater} aragonite, corresponding to decreasing organic content in the different phases. This, as well as an observed enrichment of Mg in the organic-rich growth-banding of the pearls, suggests an at least partially organic speciation of Mg and Mn in bivalves and may be responsible for the observed physiological influence on Mg/Ca and Mn/Ca ratios in bivalves as a proxy for environmental parameters. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Several species of planktonic foraminifera precipitate a final layer of calcite onto the shell surface immediately prior to gamete release at the end of the foraminifera life cycle. Here, we present the results of carbon-13, oxygen-18 and thermal labeling experiments conducted under high (HL) and low light (LL) regimes that vary symbiont photosynthetic activity. Mean experimental group data show that gametogenic (gam) calcite contributes between 4-17{\%} and 14-20{\%} to final shell mass for high and low light experiments respectively. These data indicate that past studies of gam calcite addition have overestimated the amount of gam calcite on foraminifera shells by {\~{}} 30-55{\%}. Calculations indicate that the mass of gam calcite added to the O. universa shell, 4.2 ?? 2.0????g and 4.0 ?? 2.4????g, is constant in the HL and LL groups respectively. We propose that the production of gam calcite may be the result of the discharge of a relatively constant-volume cytoplasmic pool of either Ca2+ or alkalinity (carbon pool) that increases the calcite saturation state in the microenvironment adjacent to the foraminifera shell just prior to gamete formation and release. Results from these experiments indicate that the geochemistry of thin-walled O. universa from deep sea sediments is composed of {\textgreater} 80{\%} ontogenetic calcite that was precipitated in the primary, near surface habitat of this species.},

The cobalt concentrations observed in this work are much lower than most previously reported values. Surface concentrations in the North Central Pacific Ocean averaged about 10 nanograms/liter. Tropical Northeast Pacific Ocean waters and Oregon coastal waters averaged about 20 and 46 ng Co/l., respectively, after a few high values suspected of contamination were omitted. Tropical North Atlantic Ocean waters averaged approximately 25 ng Co/l., while Bering Sea and Mediterranean Sea waters averaged approximately 30 and 20 ng Co/l., respectively. Various coastal areas throughout the world contained slightly higher concentrations. The distribution of cobalt in the oceans is highly variable.

abstract = {Breeding performance of seabirds reflects conditions in the marine environment, and seabirds are often considered suitable indicators because they are sensitive to variations in food supply and relatively easy to observe. However, any individual parameter (e.g. breeding success of a particular species at one site) may also be affected by drivers other than food supply, and selecting a suitable univariate indicator can be difficult, particularly if independent estimates of food availability on the appropriate scale are unavailable. We propose combining several data sets to overcome this limitation: if a given temporal pattern occurs for several parameters measured at one site, or for the same parameter measured at several sites, it is likely to reflect important spatiotemporal environmental variation, probably linked to food supply. Multivariate statistical techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), can be used to extract common signals from a number of intercorrelated time series. Examples from seabirds in the North Sea demonstrate that such common signals are correlated with physical and biological environmental variables. We propose a preliminary ‘North Sea seabird index' and discuss how this index could be used in ecosystem-based management.},

The three 3D volumes were examined by computing solid-body surface representations and slices through the volume and by eroding the structure progressively through raising of the threshold. The di-decameric molecule of {\~{}}D and [3c-hemocyanins, reconstructed from side views, are very similar and are composed of a cylindrical wall, comprising ten oblique wall units, and of two collar complexes located at both ends of the cylinder, comprising each five arches and an annular collar made up of five collar units. Erosion of the structure reveals that the wall looks like a segment of a five-stranded right-handed helix and that each oblique wall unit resembles a figure 8 inclined to the right. The decameric half molecule of {\~{}}o-hemocyanin, reconstructed from end-on views, resembles the whole molecule, except that the collar is thinner and appears composed of five independent collar complex units. It is suggested that the difference in structural appearance of the collar complex between the whole and the half {\~{}}D-hemocyanin may be due to the missing cone artifact, induced by the angular limitations imposed by the goniometer of the electron microscope. The comparison between the {\~{}}D-hemocyanin and the [3c-di-decameric hemocyanin at high thresholds suggests that in the {\~{}}c-hemocyanin the oblique wall units of each half molecule may be linked by two connections, whereas in {\~{}}D-hemocyanin there may be only one. This difference in the number of connections may be responsible for the lower stability of the {\~{}}D molecule at high salt concentration.},

Analysis of 262 sequences revealed the presence of five genetic types belonging to two distinct lineages. Although the morphospecies G. ruber occurs throughout the investigated region, its constituent 'cryptic' genetic types show a pattern of widespread exclusion, which is difficult to reconcile with the concept of ubiquitous dispersal. One of the newly discovered genetic types was exclusively found at stations in the Mediterranean Sea, possibly representing the smallest-scale example of endemism known in planktonic foraminifera. In general, our results suggest that the geographical scale of mutual exclusion between the genotypes is negatively correlated with their phylogenetic relatedness: the most similar and most recently diverged pair of siblings showed the strongest evidence for small-scale competitive exclusion. This pattern is consistent with the concept of niche partitioning, implying decreasing level of competition between genetic types with increasing degree of genetic divergence.},

We address this key issue using the continuously growing fin bony rays of the Tuebingen long-fin zebrafish as a model for bone mineralization. Employing high-resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopy imaging, electron diffraction, and elemental analysis, we demonstrate the presence of an abundant amorphous calcium phosphate phase in the newly formed fin bones. The extracted amorphous mineral particles crystallize with time, and mineral crystallinity increases during bone maturation. Based on these findings, we propose that this amorphous calcium phosphate phase may be a precursor phase that later transforms into the mature crystalline mineral.},

Our analysis suggests that not only is the present exploitation rate unsustainable, but that even regimens close to the maximum sustainable yield may be potentially prone to risk.

abstract = {Calcium carbonate has been precipitated from aqueous solutions containing magnesium under conditions of high supersaturation. The precipitates were analysed over time using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Infrared Spectroscopy (IR), and it was demonstrated that in all cases amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) was the first phase formed. The magnesium content of the ACC was defined by the Mg:Ca ratio in the solution, and increased systematically with increasing Mg:Ca. In turn, ACC occluding higher magnesium concentrations was significantly more stable than low magnesium ACC. The crystalline phase produced on transformation of ACC depended on the Mg:Ca ratio, and ACC precipitated from solutions containing higher Mg concentrations crystallised to yield high-Mg calcites (occluding up to 47mol{\%} Mg), together with CaCO3.H2O and/or CaCO3.6H2O. The magnesium content of the ACC phase also directly affected the final morphology of the precipitates, such that continuous sheets of CaCO3 were produced at the air/solution interface at solution ratios of 3:1 Mg:Ca and above. Previously, this effect has only been observed for ACC stabilised with organic additives. These results have relevance to the mechanism of formation of biological magnesian calcites, and suggest that the stabilisation of ACC by magnesium may provide organisms with a mechanism for controlling crystal morphologies. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

High cell densities were observed twice a year, in March (up to 41 × 103 cells 1-1) and in September/October (up to 52 × 103 cells 1-1). In the intervening months, cell densities were extremely low (0-20 × 103 cells 1-1), reflecting a strong seasonality. The main production of coccolithophores took place in the middle photic zone between 50 and 100m water depth. In total 125 coccolithophore species were identified but only five constituted on average more than 30{\%} of the community: Emiliania huxleyi, Umbellosphaera irregularis, U. tenuis, Florisphaera profunda and Gephyrocapsa ericsonii. The generally low, but seasonally dynamic coccolithophore cell density variability is compared with in situ measurements of environmental parameters. Correlation analyses between cell density variability of the dominant taxa and potentially controlling environmental parameters show significant correlation coefficients when the data set was separated into upper and lower photic zone. Cell densities of all dominant taxa are most highly correlated with temperature variability. U. irregularis is positively correlated in the upper photic zone, whereas E. huxleyi and G. ericsonii are negatively correlated. In the lower photic zone, F. profunda cell densities are positively correlated with light, which corresponds to the maximum bottom-up control (i.e. by physical forcing) of any species encountered. The surprisingly low correlations of cell densities with nitrate and phosphate may be caused by insufficient sampling resolution, nutrient levels close to detection limits, or both. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

This snowball model predicts that postglacial, greenhouse-induced warming would lead to the deposition of banded iron formations and cap carbonates. Although global glaciation would have drastically curtailed biological productivity, melting of the oceanic ice would also have induced a cyanobacterial bloom, leading to an oxygen spike in the euphotic zone and to the oxidative precipitation of iron and manganese. A Paleoproterozoic snowball Earth at 2.4 Giga-annum before present (Ga) immediately precedes the Kalahari Manganese Field in southern Africa, suggesting that this rapid and massive change in global climate was responsible for its deposition. As large quantities of O(2) are needed to precipitate this Mn, photosystem II and oxygen radical protection mechanisms must have evolved before 2.4 Ga. This geochemical event may have triggered a compensatory evolutionary branching in the Fe/Mn superoxide dismutase enzyme, providing a Paleoproterozoic calibration point for studies of molecular evolution.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification, the drop in seawater pH associated with the ongoing enrichment of marine waters with carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning, may seriously impair marine calcifying organisms. Our present understanding of the sensitivity of marine life to ocean acidification is based primarily on short-term experiments, in which organisms are exposed to increased concentrations of CO2. However, phytoplankton species with short generation times, in particular, may be able to respond to environmental alterations through adaptive evolution. Here, we examine the ability of the world's single most important calcifying organism, the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, to evolve in response to ocean acidification in two 500-generation selection experiments. Specifically, we exposed E. huxleyi populations founded by single or multiple clones to increased concentrations of CO2. Around 500 asexual generations later we assessed their fitness. Compared with populations kept at ambient CO2 partial pressure, those selected at increased partial pressure exhibited higher growth rates, in both the single- and multiclone experiment, when tested under ocean acidification conditions. Calcification was partly restored: rates were lower under increased CO2 conditions in all cultures, but were up to 50{\%} higher in adapted compared with non-adapted cultures. We suggest that contemporary evolution could help to maintain the functionality of microbial processes at the base of marine food webs in the face of global change.  },

abstract = {Chemical weathering of the continents is central to the regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and hence global climate. On million-year timescales silicate weathering leads to the draw-down of carbon dioxide, and on millennial timescales chemical weathering affects the calcium carbonate saturation state of the oceans and hence their uptake of carbon dioxide. However, variations in chemical weathering rates over glacial-interglacial cycles remain uncertain. During glacial periods, cold and dry conditions reduce the rate of chemical weathering, but intense physical weathering and the exposure of carbonates on continental shelves due to low sea levels may increase this rate. Here we present high-resolution records of the lead isotope composition of ferromanganese crusts from the North Atlantic Ocean that cover the past 550,000 years. Combining these records with a simple quantitative model of changes in the lead isotope composition of the deep North Atlantic Ocean in response to chemical weathering, we find that chemical weathering rates were two to three times lower in the glaciated interior of the North Atlantic Region during glacial periods than during the intervening interglacial periods. This decrease roughly balances the increase in chemical weathering caused by the exposure of continental shelves, indicating that chemical weathering rates remained relatively constant on glacial-interglacial timescales. On timescales of more than a million years, however, we suggest that enhanced weathering of silicate glacial sediments during interglacial periods results in a net draw-down of atmospheric carbon dioxide, creating a positive feedback on global climate that, once initiated, promotes cooling and further glaciation.},

abstract = {Specimens of the limpet Patella aspera were collected from a clean, coastal marine site and a contaminated estuary on the south coast of Portugal. The shells were analysed individually for their minor (Mg, Sr) and trace element (Fe, Mn, Zn) content. Mean concentrations of these elements in the shell of P. aspera were 4651, 1318, 35.8, 29.9 and 5.5 $\mu$g g-1, respectively. The elemental concentrations exhibited both a marked intra- and inter-population variability. Despite the variability within individual populations, significant differences in the trace element composition were apparent between the shells taken from the two sites. Small shells ({\textless}2 g) provided the best resolution between sites for both manganese and iron. Differences in zinc were best resolved for larger shells. The shell of P. aspera has an extraordinarily high magnesium concentration, which is insensitive to gross salinity differences, and a trace metal assemblage that can be interpreted in terms of environmental exposure. On these grounds, it is recommended that the shell of P. aspera is a tissue for potential use in environmental trace metal monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The physical basis for how macromolecules regulate the onset of mineral formation in calcifying tissues is not well established. A popular conceptual model assumes the organic matrix provides a stereochemical match during cooperative organization of solute ions. In contrast, another uses simple binding assays to identify good promoters of nucleation. Here, we reconcile these two views and provide a mechanistic explanation for template-directed nucleation by correlating heterogeneous nucleation barriers with crystal-substrate-binding free energies. We first measure the kinetics of calcite nucleation onto model substrates that present different functional group chemistries (carboxyl, thiol, phosphate, and hydroxyl) and conformations (C11 and C16 chain lengths). We find rates are substrate-specific and obey predictions of classical nucleation theory at supersaturations that extend above the solubility of amorphous calcium carbonate. Analysis of the kinetic data shows the thermodynamic barrier to nucleation is reduced by minimizing the interfacial free energy of the system, $\gamma$. We then use dynamic force spectroscopy to independently measure calcite-substrate-binding free energies, $\Delta$Gb. Moreover, we show that within the classical theory of nucleation, $\gamma$ and $\Delta$Gb should be linearly related. The results bear out this prediction and demonstrate that low-energy barriers to nucleation correlate with strong crystal-substrate binding. This relationship is general to all functional group chemistries and conformations. These findings provide a physical model that reconciles the long-standing concept of templated nucleation through stereochemical matching with the conventional wisdom that good binders are good nucleators. The alternative perspectives become internally consistent when viewed through the lens of crystal-substrate binding.},

abstract = {The control of cell fate was investigated in the root epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana. Two distinct types of differentiated epidermal cells are normally present: root-hair-bearing cells and hairless cells. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, epidermal cell fate was found to be correlated with cell position, with root-hair cells located over radial walls between cortical cells, and with hairless cells located directly over cortical cells. This normal positional relationship was absent in ttg (transparent testa glabrous) mutants (lacking trichomes, anthocyanins, and seed coat mucilage); epidermal cells in all positions differentiate into root-hair cells. The opposite condition was generated in roots of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing the maize R (R-Lc) gene product (a putative TTG homologue) under the control of a strong promoter (CaMV35S), which produced hairless epidermal cells in all positions. In both the ttg and R-expressing roots, epidermal cell differentiation was affected at an early stage, prior to the onset of cell elongation or root-hair formation. The ttg mutations were also associated with abnormalities in the morphology and organization of cells within and surrounding the root apical meristem. The results indicate that alterations in TTG activity cause developing epidermal cells to misinterpret their position and differentiate into inappropriate cell types. This suggests that, in wild-type roots, TTG provides, or responds to, positional signals to cause differentiating epidermal cells that lie over cortical cells to adopt a hairless cell fate.},

Different anisotropic effects on crystal texture were observed for sea urchin and mollusk calcite crystals, whereas none was found for the foraminifer, Patellina, and the control calcite crystals.

abstract = {The ground-state structural and electronic properties of bulk calcite (CaCO3) are calculated from first principles by working within the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave implementation of density functional theory. Calculated charge density plots for bulk calcite show clearly the mixed ionic and covalent bonding in this mineral. From these plots the relative size of the constituent atoms are determined by calculating bonded radii. In calcite, the 0 atoms are shown to be smaller than expected from ionic measures of the atomic size and of a similar size to the Ca atoms. Examination of the one-electron eigenfunctions and the computed density of states reveals the character of local bonding. Comparison of the computed density of states with recent X-ray photoemission data allows the orbital character of the experimental valence band peaks to be assigned. The highest occupied states are of O 2p character, with Ca 3p states mixing slightly with carbonate group states in the valence region. The calculated value of the band gap in calcite is consistent with the experimental value, as measured by reflection electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Lattice parameters are reproduced to within 5{\%} of their experimental equilibrium values. Under pressure the carbonate group is shown to act as a rigid structural unit, with the C-0 bond length decreasing by approximately 3 mA, for a 5{\%} compression in volume.},

abstract = {Salinity and temperature determine seawater density, and differences in both thereby control global thermohaline circulation. Whereas numerous proxies have been calibrated and applied to reconstruct temperature, a direct and independent proxy for salinity is still missing. Ideally, a new proxy for salinity should target one of the direct constituents of dissolved salt, such as [Na+] or [Cl-]. This study investigates the impact of salinity on foraminiferal Na/Ca values by laser ablation ICP-MS analyses of specimens of the benthic foraminifer Ammonia tepida cultured at a range of salinities (30.0-38.6). Foraminifera at lower salinities (30.0 and 32.5) added more chambers (10-11) to their test over the course of the culturing experiment than those maintained at higher salinities (36.1, 7-8 chambers, and 38.6, 6-7 chambers), suggesting that growth rates in this species are promoted by lower salinities. The Na/Ca of cultured specimens correlates significantly with seawater salinity (Na/Ca=0.22S-0.75, R-2 = 0.96, p {\textless} 0.01) and size. Values for Na /Ca and D-Na vary between 5.17 and 9.29 mmol mol(-1) and 0.12-0.16 x 10(-3), which are similar to values from inorganic precipitation experiments. The significant correlation between test size and Na /Ca results from co-variation with salinity. This implies that foraminiferal Na /Ca could serve as a robust and independent proxy for salinity, enabling salinity reconstructions independent of calcitic delta O-18.},

abstract = {Boron enters plant roots as undissociated boric acid (H3BO3). Significant differences in B uptake are frequently observed even when plants are grown under identical conditions. It has been theorized that these differences reflect species differences in permeability coefficient of H3BO3 across plasma membrane. The permeability coefficient of boric acid however, has not been experimentally determined across any artificial or plant membrane. In the experiments described here the permeability coefficient of boric acid in liposomes made of phosphatidylcholine was 4.9 X 10(-6) cm sec(-1), which is in good agreement with the theoretical value. The permeability coefficient varied from 7 X 10(-6) to 9.5 X 10(-9) cm sec(-1) with changes in sterols (cholesterol), the type of phospholipid head group, the length of the fatty acyl chain, and the pH of the medium. In this study we also used Arabidopsis thaliana mutants which differ in lipid composition to study the effect of lipid composition on B uptake. The chs1-1 mutant which has lower proportion of sterols shows 30{\%} higher B uptake compared with the wild type, while the act1-1 mutant which has an increased percentage of longer fatty acids, exhibited 35{\%} lower uptake than the wild type. Lipid composition changes in each of the remaining mutants influenced B uptake to various extents. These data suggest that lipid composition of the plasma membrane can affect total B uptake.},

(2) If there are more subspecies at lower latitudes within species, can area of breeding range explain this relationship? and (3) how do latitudinal differences in subspecies within species vary geographically across the globe? Using all species with five or more subspecies from 12 of the most diverse families of birds in the world, we found consistently more subspecies at lower latitudes across all families, both hemispheres, and all continents examined. Despite the positive influence of area on the number of subspecies within species, area did not explain the greater number of subspecies at lower latitudes within species. Global patterns of subspecies support the idea that phenotypic differentiation of populations is greater at lower latitudes within species. If subspecies density provides an index of rates of incipient speciation, then our results support evolutionary hypotheses for the latitudinal diversity gradient that invoke higher tropical speciation rates.},

abstract = {We constructed a precise early Eocene orbital cyclostratigraphy for DSDP Site 550 (Leg 80, Goban Spur, North Atlantic) utilizing precession related cycles as represented in a high-resolution X-ray fluorescence based barium core log. Based on counting of those cycles, we constrain the exact timing of two volcanic ash layers in Site 550 which correlate to ashes + 19 and - 17 of the Fur Formation in Denmark. The ashes, relative to the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), are offset by 862 kyr and 672 kyr, respectively. When combined with published absolute ages for ash - 17, the absolute age for the onset of the PETM is consistent with astronomically calibrated ages. Using the current absolute age of 28.02 Ma for the Fish Canyon Tuff (FCT) standard for calibrating the absolute age of ash - 17 is consistent with tuning option 2 in the astronomically calibrated Paleocene time scale of Westerhold et al.

Using the recently recalibrated absolute age of 28.201 Ma for the FCT standard is consistent with tuning option 3 in the astronomically calibrated Paleocene time scale.

Wetlands are often cited as being effective at reducing nutrient and sediment loadings to receiving waters. However, the research in this area is inconsistent, and whilst most studies have shown that both natural and constructed wetlands retain nutrients and sediments, others have shown that they have little effect, or even increase nutrient and sediment loads to receiving water bodies. DEFRA has commissioned a systematic review on the use of wetlands to mitigate N, P and SS inputs from agriculture to receiving freshwater in England. The review will encompass a comprehensive literature search on all available material on the subject, both published and unpublished within the British Isles. Specific inclusion criteria will be adhered to and a formal assessment of the quality and reliability of the studies will be undertaken. The data will then be extracted and a data synthesis undertaken. The review will inform an evidence-based policy that can be implemented by stakeholders.},

abstract = {Using a coupled fluid flow-mass transfer model to calculate the Sr flux resulting from the weathering of the young Columbia River basalts, it can be shown that the dissolution of the reactive phases in the extensive continental flood basalt could have caused the significant inflection in the marine Sr isotope record that occurred approximately 15 million years ago. The results of our model demonstrate the important and often overlooked role that the weathering of large igneous provinces can play in geochemical cycles. Furthermore, by approaching the question of continental Sr fluxes to the ocean using a mass transfer model, we are able to establish a quantitative relationship between the marine Sr record, chemical weathering rates and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The CO2 drawdown rates that we calculate for the weathering of the Columbia River basalt suggest that, on a several million-year timescale, the formation of large igneous provinces represents a net sink for atmospheric CO2. The removal of CO2 via the rapid dissolution of the Columbia River basalts represents an alternative explanation for the glacial period believed to have followed its formation. We also consider the potential role that basalt weathering could play in the evolution of the Sr-87/Sr-87 ratio of the oceans since the early Cretaceous. Rapid Sr release during basalt dissolution combined with variations in the relative exposure of young vs. old lithologies could explain changes in the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of the oceans without calling on dramatic increases in the continental Sr flux over that time period. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for changes in the relative exposure of different lithologies when considering the nature of global geochemical cycles in the geologic past.

abstract = {Six carbonate samples of different origin were investigated for their properties: composition, grain size (Mz), specific surface area (SSA) and electrokinetic ($\zeta$) potential. Four of the samples were of natural origin-one sample was sea sediment, one lake sediment and two limestone rocks. The remaining two samples were synthetic calcites. The results of characterisation have shown that the samples consisted mostly of calcite. Traces of impurities (Si, Al, Fe, Mg) and organic matter were found in natural samples. The grain size of samples ranged between 2.0 and 10.3 $\mu$m, and SSA values were between 17.0 and 1.0 m2 g-1 accordingly. The electrokinetic mobility measurements were performed in the pH range from 6 to 10. The results have shown two different types of behaviour: Synthetic calcites had positive $\zeta$-potential at the point of equilibrium (pHeq = 8.4 ± 0.1), which decreased with either the increase or the decrease of the pH. Natural calcites, in contrast, had negative $\zeta$-potential throughout the entire investigated pH range. Electrokinetic behaviour of synthetic samples was the result of the exchange between the constituent ions in the solution and the available surface sites. The pH decrease caused the dissolution of the particles, and consequently the diminution of the grain size and surface area. Lower values of the $\zeta$-potential were then the result of the specific adsorption of constituent anions on such reduced surface area. Going towards higher pH values, the decrease in the $\zeta$-potential (and finally the charge reversal) was caused by the increasing concentration of the CO2-3. The isoelectric point (pHIEP) was reached at about pH ≈ 9.5. The electrokinetic behaviour of natural samples on the other hand was not the result of the exchange of constituent ions between the surface and the solution. Their $\zeta$-potential was governed by the organic matter attached to the surface or incorporated in the structure of calcite. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {In this study, we present experimental results from the planktic foraminifer Orbulina universa, cultured in the laboratory. We demonstrate that the $\delta$13C of shell calcite precipitated in 13C-labeled seawater for 24h can be resolved and accurately measured using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). Specimens maintained at 20°C were transferred from ambient seawater ($\delta$13CDIC=+1.3‰) into seawater with $\delta$13CDIC=+51.5‰ and enriched [Ba2+] for 24h. Specimens were then transferred into ambient seawater with elevated [87Sr] for 6-9h of calcification, followed by a transfer back into unlabeled ambient seawater until gametogenesis. This technique produced O. universa shells with calcite layers of distinct geochemical signatures. We quantify the spatial positions of trace element labels in the shells using laser ablation ICP-MS depth profiling. Using fragments from the same shells, we quantify intrashell $\delta$13Ccalcite using SIMS with a 6 or 8$\mu$m spot (2 SD range ±0.5‰ to 1.7‰). Measured $\delta$13Ccalcite values in O. universa shell layers precipitated in ambient seawater are within 2‰ of predicted $\delta$13Ccalcite values. In 13C-labeled bands of calcite, 6$\mu$m SIMS spot measurements are within 2‰ of predicted $\delta$13Ccalcite values, whereas 8$\mu$m SIMS spots yield intermediate, mixed values. The spatial agreement between trace element and carbon isotope data suggests that 13C and cation tracers are synchronously incorporated into shell calcite. These results demonstrate the ability of SIMS $\delta$13C measurements to resolve {\~{}}10$\mu$m features in foraminifer shell calcite using a 6$\mu$m spot, and highlight the potential of this technique for addressing questions about ecology, biomineralization, and paleoceanography. {\textcopyright} 2014 .},

abstract = {The importance of the metastable vaterite form of CaCO3 is increasingly appreciated as an intermediate between amorphous calcium carbonate and more stable crystalline polymorphs in biogenic calcification pathways. Thus, there is a need to be able to identify nanocrystals of vaterite unambiguously, despite uncertainties about its exact crystal structure. The structures that have been proposed for vaterite are all based upon a common average structure with orientationally disordered carbonate groups. However, there is much ambiguity in the literature about the actual superstructure, and hence diffraction behavior of vaterite, some misinterpretation of data, and some claims that cannot be correct. This critical review of the literature aims to resolve the issue. The orientationally disordered (2H) structure is unlikely to occur, and the most plausible structures all share a √3 × √3 superstructure in the xy plane. Most experimental evidence is consistent with occurrence of 2M and 6H polytypes, but ab initio modeling suggests that these do not occur in their highest-symmetry forms, but have space-group symmetries C121 and P3221. Stacking faults in the xy plane are very common, and frequently result in packets of 4- or 6-layer periodicity, which can be regarded as nanoscale intergrowths of 4M and 6A1 polytypes.},

abstract = {A comparative study has been made of two species of planktonic foraminifera, G. tumida and G. sacculifer, in a depth transect on the Ontong Java Plateau, western equatorial Pacific. G. tumida tests from core-top sediments showed decreasing Mg/Ca (2.65-1.25 mmol/mol) and Sr/Ca (1.50-1.16 mmol/mol) ratios with increasing water depth (1600-4400 m), while no such variation was found in G. sacculifer tests in excess of 355 µm (average Mg/Ca, 3.6 mmol/mol, Sr/Ca, 1.4 mmol/mol). Artificial dissolution of G. tumida tests led to a decrease in both Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca, but in G. sacculifer, there was no significant change in the ratios. Analyses by electron microprobe revealed that Mg/Ca of the inner (chamber) calcite in G. tumida tests was much higher than that of the calcite crust (keel), whereas Sr/Ca was only slightly elevated. There were no consistent spatial differences in either Mg/Ca or Sr/Ca for G. sacculifer tests. Dissolution in the oceans gives rise to the removal of the chamber calcite in G. tumida (about 30{\%} of the total calcite), leaving the keel calcite. Although G. tumida is thought of as a dissolution-resistant form, the majority of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca depletion (and chamber loss) occurs above the lysocline. It is also possible that much of the Mg-enriched gametogenic calcite has been lost by dissolution from G. sacculifer above 1600 m. Mg content has a significant effect on the dissolution susceptibility of planktonic foraminifera. Calculations show that the saturation horizon for Mg-rich parts of tests may be elevated by several hundred meters compared with normal calcite.},

abstract = {Agriculture is responsible for large scale water quality degradation and is estimated to contribute around 55{\%} of the nitrogen entering the European Seas. The key policy instrument for protecting inland, transitional and coastal water resources is the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Reducing nutrient losses from agriculture is crucial to the successful implementation of the WFD. There are several mitigation measures that can be implemented to reduce nitrogen losses from agricultural areas to surface and ground waters. For the selection of appropriate measures, models are useful for quantifying the expected impacts and the associated costs. In this article we review some of the models used in Europe to assess the effectiveness of nitrogen mitigation measures, ranging from fertilizer management to the construction of riparian areas and wetlands. We highlight how the complexity of models is correlated with the type of scenarios that can be tested, with conceptual models mostly used to evaluate the impact of reduced fertilizer application, and the physically-based models used to evaluate the timing and location of mitigation options and the response times. We underline the importance of considering the lag time between the implementation of measures and effects on water quality. Models can be effective tools for targeting mitigation measures (identifying critical areas and timing), for evaluating their cost effectiveness, for taking into consideration pollution swapping and considering potential trade-offs in contrasting environmental objectives. Models are also useful for involving stakeholders during the development of catchments mitigation plans, increasing their acceptability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The highest rates of gross photosynthesis (Pg) were found on the tissue covering the septa, the tentacles, and the tissues sur- rounding the mouth opening of the polyp. Lower rates were found on the tissues of the wall and the coenosarc. Calcification was investigated by radioactive tracers. The incorporation pattern of 45Ca and 14C in the cor- allites was imaged with use of a Micro-Imager. The b-images obtained showed that the incorporation of the radioactive tracers coincided with the Pg distribution pattern with the highest incorporation rates found in the corallite septa. Thus, the high growth rate of the septa is supported by the high rates of Pg by the symbiont in the adjacent tissues. The total incorporation rates were higher in light than in dark, however, the distribution pattern of the radioisotope incorporation was not af- fected by illumination. This further emphasizes the close relation between calcification and photosynthesis.},

abstract = {Offsets from isotopic equilibrium in biogenic carbonates have complicated paleoclimate reconstructions for decades. A new archive of climate, deep-sea corals, is used to evaluate the calcification processes, independent of photosynthesis, that contribute to these offsets. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope data from six modern deep-sea corals show strong linear trends between ??13C and ??18O. Slopes of these trends between samples are similar and range between 1.9 to 2.6 for ????13C/?? ??18O. Linear trends intersect isotopic equilibrium for ??18O and are slightly depleted for ??13C. Variations in the isotopic ratios are strongly correlated with the density banding structure. Isotopically depleted aragonite is associated with light, quickly precipitating bands, whereas isotopically enriched points correspond to slowly accumulating, less dense aragonite. The densest white band at the trabecular center is furthest from isotopic equilibrium for both carbon and oxygen. Data from this region fall off the linear trend between ??18O and ??13C. This deviation, where ??13C remains constant while the ??18O continues to decrease, does not support "vital effect" mechanisms that call upon kinetic fractionation to explain offsets from isotopic equilibrium. We propose a new mechanism for vital effects in these deep-sea corals that is based on a thermodynamic response to a biologically induced pH gradient in the calcifying region. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Little is known about the combined impacts of future CO2 and temperature increases on the growth and physiology of marine picocyanobacteria. We incubated Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus under present-day (380 ppm) or predicted year-2100 CO2 levels (750 ppm), and under normal versus elevated temperatures (+4 degrees C) in semicontinuous cultures. Increased temperature stimulated the cell division rates of Synechococcus but not Prochlorococcus. Doubled CO2 combined with elevated temperature increased maximum chl a-normalized photosynthetic rates of Synechococcus four times relative to controls. Temperature also altered other photosynthetic parameters (alpha, Phi(max), E-k, and Delta F/F-m') in Synechococcus, but these changes were not observed for Prochlorococcus. Both increased CO2 and temperature raised the phycobilin and chl a content of Synechococcus, while only elevated temperature increased divinyl chl a in Prochlorococcus. Cellular carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) quotas, but not phosphorus (P) quotas, increased with elevated CO2 in Synechococcus, leading to similar to 20{\%} higher C:P and N:P ratios. In contrast, Prochlorococcus elemental composition remained unaffected by CO2, but cell volume and elemental quotas doubled with increasing temperature while maintaining constant stoichiometry. Synechococcus showed a much greater response to CO2 and temperature increases for most parameters measured, compared with Prochlorococcus. Our results suggest that global change could influence the dominance of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus ecotypes, with likely effects on oligotrophic food-web structure. However, individual picocyanobacteria strains may respond quite differently to future CO2 and temperature increases, and caution is needed when generalizing their responses to global change in the ocean.},

By using water etching, infrared spectroscopy, electron diffraction, and environmental scanning electron microscopy, we show that sea urchin spine regeneration proceeds via the initial deposition of amorphous calcium carbonate. Because most echinoderms produce the same type of skeletal material, they probably all use this same mechanism. Deposition of transient amorphous phases as a strategy for producing single crystals with complex morphology may have interesting implications for the development of sophisticated materials.},

abstract = {Using the CRPG-CNRS Cameca 1270 ion microprobe facility, we have measured boron isotopic compositions (B-11/B-10) in different ultrastructural components of the deep-sea aragonitic scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa. We observe a systematic difference in B isotopic composition between the Early Mineralization Zone EMZ) and adjacent fibrous skeleton. In EMZ the measured delta(11) B values are consistently low. Fibrous aragonite is characterized by systematically higher delta(11) B values but also displays B isotopic heterogeneity associated with specific growth bands in the calyx wall. The magnitude of the observed B isotopic variations cannot be explained by changes in environmental conditions and is likely caused by biological processes involved in the biomineralization of new skeleton, i. e., vital'' effects. The observed B isotopic variations are opposite to the predictions of geochemical models for vital effects. These models are based on the idea that stable isotopic fractionations including C and O) in coral skeleton are driven by changes in pH of the fluid from which the skeleton is presumed to precipitate. Our data indicate that pH variations are not responsible for the observed stable isotopic fractionations. Geochemical models therefore do not provide an adequate framework within which to understand coral skeletal formation. Without a better understanding of these processes the use of B isotopic composition to reconstruct paleo- pH variations in the oceans must be considered problematic, at least as far as Lophelia pertusa is concerned.

abstract = {The sulphur cycle has evolved over the course of the Earth's history. The early Earth's surface environment was reducing, containing little atmospheric oxygen, and with seawater sulphate concentrations estimated at less than a few per cent of those found today. The accumulation of sulphate in the ocean to much higher concentrations was probably coincident with the initial accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere and the consequent oxidative weathering of sulphide minerals on land. Past changes in sulphate concentrations in ancient oceans have previously been assessed by comparing the systematics of sulphur isotope fractionation by sulphate-reducing bacteria with the isotopic composition of sedimentary sulphides. But such interpretations have proven equivocal: the generally small 34S depletions in Archaean sulphides (deposited {\~{}}2.5-3.8 billion years ago) have been separately argued to result both from rapid sulphate reduction in a sulphate- rich ocean, and from sulphide formation in a sulphate-poor ocean. Here we report large 34S depletions of 20-25{\%}, observed during rapid sulphate reduction by sulphate-reducing bacteria in modern photosynthetic cyanobacterial mats from Solar Lake, Sinai. We conclude that high sulphate concentrations give rise to highly 34S-depleted sulphides, and thus that appreciable concentrations of seawater sulphate did not accumulate until the initial accumulation of oxygen into the atmosphere in post-Archaean times.},

abstract = {In plants, viral synergisms occur when one virus enhances infection by a distinct or unrelated virus. Such synergisms may be unidirectional or mutualistic but, in either case, synergism implies that protein(s) from one virus can enhance infection by another. A mechanistically related phenomenon is transcomplementation, in which a viral protein, usually expressed from a transgene, enhances or supports the infection of a virus from a distinct species. To gain an insight into the characteristics and limitations of these helper functions of individual viral genes, and to assess their effects on the plant-pathogen relationship, reports of successful synergism and transcomplementation were compiled from the peer-reviewed literature and combined with data from successful viral gene exchange experiments. Results from these experiments were tabulated to highlight the phylogenetic relationship between the helper and dependent viruses and, where possible, to identify the protein responsible for the altered infection process. The analysis of more than 150 publications, each containing one or more reports of successful exchanges, transcomplementation or synergism, revealed the following: (i) diverse viral traits can be enhanced by synergism and transcomplementation; these include the expansion of host range, acquisition of mechanical transmission, enhanced specific infectivity, enhanced cell-to-cell and long-distance movement, elevated or novel vector transmission, elevated viral titre and enhanced seed transmission; (ii) transcomplementation and synergism are mediated by many viral proteins, including inhibitors of gene silencing, replicases, coat proteins and movement proteins; (iii) although more frequent between closely related viruses, transcomplementation and synergism can occur between viruses that are phylogenetically highly divergent. As indicators of the interoperability of viral genes, these results are of general interest, but they can also be applied to the risk assessment of transgenic crops expressing viral proteins. In particular, they can contribute to the identification of potential hazards, and can be used to identify data gaps and limitations in predicting the likelihood of transgene-mediated transcomplementation.},

Removal of the IOM prior to the chemical analysis by LA-ICP-MS or mathematical correction for the IOM-derived magnesium concentrations is therefore strongly advised. The different chemistry of the IOM may also exert a major control on the trace element to calcium ratios Shell portions enriched in IOM will show up to 200 times higher Mg/Ca and up to two times higher Sr/Ca ratios than the average shell of A islandica Without removal of the IOM prior to the analysis, Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of shell portions with higher IOM content cannot be used as paleothermometers. Because it is currently impossible to remove the IOM prior to chemical analyses by LA-ICP-MS, we recommend the use of wet chemical techniques (= possibility to separate and measure individual shell components) such as ICP-OES at the expense of lower sampling resolution The results of this study will significantly improve our understanding of shell-based climate and environmental proxies.},

abstract = {T he backbone of scientific computing is mostly a collection of high-perfor-mance code written in Fortran, C, and C++ that typically runs in batch mode on large systems, clusters, and supercomputers. However, over the past decade, high-level environ-ments that integrate easy-to-use interpreted lan-guages, comprehensive numerical libraries, and visualization facilities have become extremely popu-lar in this field. As hardware becomes faster, the crit-ical bottleneck in scientific computing isn't always the computer's processing time; the scientist's time is also a consideration. For this reason, systems that allow rapid algorithmic exploration, data analysis, and vi-sualization have become a staple of daily scientific work. The Interactive Data Language (IDL) and Matlab (for numerical work), and Mathematica and Maple (for work that includes symbolic manipula-tion) are well-known commercial environments of this kind. GNU Data Language, Octave, Maxima and Sage provide their open source counterparts. All these systems offer an interactive command line in which code can be run immediately, without having to go through the traditional edit/com-pile/execute cycle. This flexible style matches well the spirit of computing in a scientific context, in which determining what computations must be performed next often requires significant work. An interactive environment lets scientists look at data, test new ideas, combine algorithmic approaches, and evaluate their outcome directly. This process might lead to a final result, or it might clarify how they need to build a more static, large-scale pro-duction code. As this article shows, Python (www.python.org) is an excellent tool for such a workflow. 1 The IPython project (http://ipython.scipy.org) aims to not only provide a greatly enhanced Python shell but also facilities for interactive distributed and par-allel computing, as well as a comprehensive set of tools for building special-purpose interactive envi-ronments for scientific computing.},

abstract = {We have assessed the reliability of several foraminifer-hosted proxies of the ocean carbonate system (delta(11) B, B/Ca, and U/Ca) using Holocene samples from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. We examined chemical variability over a range of test sizes for two surface-dwelling foraminifers (Globigerinoides sacculifer and Globigerinoides ruber). Measurements of delta B-11 in G. ruber show no significant relationship with test size in either Atlantic or Pacific sites and appear to provide a robust proxy of surface seawater pH. Likewise there is no significant variability in the delta B-11 of our Atlantic core top G. sacculifer, but we find that delta B-11 increases with increasing test size for G. sacculifer in the Pacific. These systematic differences in delta B-11 are inferred to be a consequence of isotopically light gametogenic calcite in G. sacculifer and its preferential preservation during postdepositional dissolution. The trace element ratio proxies of ocean carbonate equilibria, U/Ca and B/Ca, show systematic increases in both G. ruber and G. sacculifer with increasing test size, possibly as a result of changing growth rates. This behavior complicates their use in paleoceanographic reconstructions. In keeping with several previous studies we find that Mg/Ca ratios increase with increasing size fraction in our wellpreserved Atlantic G. sacculifer but not in G. ruber. In contrast to previous interpretations we suggest that these observations reflect a proportionally larger influence of compositionally distinct gametogenic calcite in small individuals compared to larger ones. As with delta B-11 this influences G. sacculifer but not G. ruber, which has negligible gametogenic calcite.},

Transforming such maps into maps of primary production can be reliably done only by using light-production models in conjunction with additional information about the column- integrated pigment content and its vertical distribution. As a preliminary effort in this direction, -4,000 vertical profiles of pigment (Chl a + Pheo a) determined only in oceanic Case 1 waters have been statistically analyzed. They were scaled according to dimensionless depths (actual depth divided by the depth of the euphotic layer, Z,) and expressed as dimensionless concentrations (actual concentration divided by the mean con- centration within the euphotic layer). The depth Z,, generally unknown, was computed with a previously developed bio-optical model. Highly significant relationships were found allowing (C{\textgreater},,,, the pigment content of the euphotic layer, to be inferred from the sur!ace concentration, C,, observed within the layer of one penetration depth. According to their C,, values (ranging from 0.01 to {\textgreater} 10 mg m-3), we categorized the profiles into seven trophic situations and computed a mean vertical profile for each. Between a quasi-uniform profile in eutrophic waters and a profile with a strong deep maximum in oligotrophic waters, the shape evolves rather regularly. The well- mixed cold waters, essentially in the Antarctic zone, have been separately examined. On average, their profiles are featureless, without deep maxima, whatever their trophic state. Averaged values of p, the ratio of Chl a to (Chl a + Pheo a), have also been obtained for each trophic category. The energy stored by photosynthesizing algae, once normalized with respect to the integrated chlorophyll biomass (C),,, is proportional to the available photosynthetic energy at the surface via a parameter {\#}*, which is the cross-section for photosynthesis per unit of areal chlorophyll. By taking advantage of the relative stability of {\#}*, we can compute primary production from ocean color data acquired from space. For such a computation, inputs are the irradiance field at the ocean surface, the “surface” pigment from which (C),, can be derived, the mean p value pertinent to the trophic situation as depicted by the ({\$} or (C),,, values, and the cross-section rc/*. Instead of a constant {\#}* value, the mean profiles can be used; they allow the climatological field of the {\#}* parameter to be adjusted through the parallel use of a spectral light-production model.},

abstract = {In CaCO3, biomineralization nucleation and growth of the crystals are related to the presence of carboxylate-rich proteins within a macromolecular matrix, often with organized beta-sheet domains. To understand the interplay between the organic template and the mineral crystal it is important to explicitly address the issue of structural adaptation of the template during mineralization. To this end we have developed a series of self-organizing surfactants (1-4) consisting of a dodecyl chain connected via a bisureido-heptylene unit to an amino acid head group. In Langmuir monolayers the spacing of these molecules in one direction is predetermined by the hydrogen-bonding distances between the bis-urea units. In the other direction, the intermolecular distance is determined by steric interactions introduced by the side groups (-R) of the amino acid moiety. Thus, by the choice of the amino acid we can systematically alter the density of the surfactant molecules in a monolayer and their ability to respond to the presence of calcium ions. The monolayer films are characterized by surface pressure-surface area (pi-A) isotherms, Brewster angle microscopy, in-situ synchrotron X-ray scattering at fixed surface area, and also infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) of films transferred to solid substrates. The developing crystals are studied with scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and crystal modeling. The results demonstrate that although all compounds are active in the nucleation of calcium carbonate, habit modification is only observed when the size of the side group allows the molecules to rearrange and adapt their organization in response to the mineral phase.},

abstract = {The term biomineralization summarizes the natural processes by which living or- ganisms form materials from bioorganic molecules and inorganic solids. This is a fascinating topic, uniting the living and the (not always really) dead world sur- rounding us. In fact, all of us have a direct relation to biomineralization, as we are ‘‘biomineralisateurs'' – producing each day crystals of a calcium phosphate (apa- tite), embedded in an organic matrix (mostly collagen), as part of the formation of bone material. These crystals are mere nanometers in size and are arranged in a well-defined hierarchical structure, so that any of us may be rightly called a bio- nano-engineer (a feat that might prove useful in grant applications). The field of biomineralization not only connects the living and the mineral world, but also brings together scientists from very diverging fields, ranging from geology, mineralogy and crystallography via chemistry and biochemistry to biology and medicine, as well as, possibly, biotechnology. Whereas research in this field was dominated by amostly descriptive approach throughout much of the last century, the last ten to twenty years have witnessed an increasingly profound scientific under- standing of the formation mechanisms of biominerals. This progress has been fuelled by the application of modern molecular biology methods and the advent of novel solid-state analytical techniques, but, most significantly, by their mutual inter- action. From the point of view of biology, the ability of an organism to form an inorganic solid material is a special feature that provides evolutionary advantages, and thus certainly deserves elaborate biochemical and molecular-biological studies. The growing interest among solid-state chemists and materials scientists lies in the processes by which the often complex and intricate hierarchical architectures of bio- minerals can be formed under conditions, which are incredibly mild, compared to the usual techniques of preparative solid-state chemistry. This is combined with a common general interest in the structures and processes occurring at the interfaces between organic matter (not necessarily of biological origin) and inorganic solids which are of utmost importance in many topical regimes of modern science (for ex- ample, in heterogeneous catalysis, organic-inorganic hybrid materials, biomaterials or in the attachment of cells to electronic devices). The idea of using synthesis methods taken from nature in order to generate materials with superior properties leads to bio-inspired preparation procedures (which take some key elements from biomineralization, for example the templating action of bioorganic polymers during precipitation of a solid) or bio-mimetic syntheses (which try to fully exploit the mechanisms active in biomineral formation and which may thus also provide an insight into the natural processes themselves). Finally, if organisms could be con- vinced by genetic engineering to produce certain materials with selected properties, the biotechnological production of high-tech materials might become feasible. The importance of biomineralization and its possible applications has recently been reflected in the set-up of dedicated research programs, such as the establish- ment of an Institute for Biologically Inspired Materials by NASA in the United States. In Germany, research on the ‘‘Principles of Biomineralization'' has been fo- cused on the priority research program of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. Of course, another clear indicator of the topical nature of this field is this volume and the great success of its predecessor. Within only four years, it has become necessary to publish a sequel, and as opposed to movies, in science sequels usually represent true progress. Many chapters are new (in that they were not part of the first edition) or novel (in that they have been totally rewritten by the authors) and most of the others have been thoroughly reviewed, a stringent necessity in view of the current progress in the field. Edmund Baeuerlein, as a professor emeritus now (mostly) freed from his time-consuming research work at the bench and the burden of administration, has devoted a lot of time and much e¤ort to make this volume not only a compendium of the latest research results but also a valuable introduc- tion for newcomers to this field. He did this by careful selecting the contributions and authors and by rigorous editing. My wish is that this book will be at least as successful as its predecessor. May the research results and ideas compiled here enlighten the reader.},

abstract = {Root hairs provide a model system for the study of cell polarity. We examined the possibility that one or more members of the distinct plant subfamily of RHO monomeric GTPases, termed Rop, may function as molecular switches regulating root hair growth. Specific Rops are known to control polar growth in pollen tubes. Overexpressing Rop2 (Rop2 OX) resulted in a strong root hair phenotype, whereas overexpressing Rop7 appeared to inhibit root hair tip growth. Overexpressing Rops from other phylogenetic subgroups of Rop did not give a root hair phenotype. We confirmed that Rop2 was expressed throughout hair development. Rop2 OX and constitutively active GTP-bound rop2 (CA-rop2) led to additional and misplaced hairs on the cell surface as well as longer hairs. Furthermore, CA-rop2 depolarized root hair tip growth, whereas Rop2 OX resulted in hairs with multiple tips. Dominant negative GDP-bound Rop2 reduced the number of hair-forming sites and led to shorter and wavy hairs. Green fluorescent protein-Rop2 localized to the future site of hair formation well before swelling formation and to the tip throughout hair development. We conclude that the Arabidopsis Rop2 GTPase acts as a positive regulatory switch in the earliest visible stage in hair development, swelling formation, and in tip growth.},

abstract = {Estimates of paleo-pH for the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean across the oxygen isotopic stage 5-6 boundary have been made based on the boron isotopic composition of planktonic (Orbulina universa) and benthic (mixed species) foraminifera from core V19-28. The estimated deep ocean pH during the penultimate glacial period was about 0.3+/-0.1 pH units higher compared to the modern deep ocean. This is consistent with previously estimated deep ocean pH changes across the stage1-2 boundary in the western equatorial Pacific and tropical Atlantic, thus arguing against the possibility that the benthic foraminifera analyzed to estimate deep ocean pH changes have been significantly affected by anomalous local environment and/or diagenesis. The estimated changes in the deep ocean carbonate chemistry require a decoupling (of several kilometers) between the saturation horizon and the lysocline during the glacial periods. Though such a decoupling could be achieved by enhanced respiration CO2 given calcite dissolution in sediments during glacial periods, it lacks support from the calcite sedimentary records. The boron isotopic compositions of planktonic foraminifera, on the other hand, indicate no significant pH change in the eastern equatorial Pacific surface ocean during the glacial-interglacial transition. This is inconsistent with an expected higher surface ocean pH during the glacial period due to lower atmospheric pCO(2) and is also in contrast with the previously estimated boron isotope based glacial-interglacial pH change of 0.2+/-0.1 pH units in the western equatorial Pacific and tropical Atlantic. The lack of change in eastern equatorial Pacific surface ocean pH between glacial-interglacial periods could be attributed to less nutrient utilization efficiency and/or enhanced calcite production during glacial periods. Such a decrease in nutrient utilization efficiency and/or increase in calcite production would lead to a greater disequilibrium between the pCO(2) of eastern equatorial Pacific surface ocean and that of the atmosphere, making this part of the ocean a greater source of CO2 to the atmosphere during glacial periods compared to today.},

abstract = {The various cleaning steps required for preparation of foraminiferal samples for Mg/Ca (and Sr/Ca) analysis are evaluated for their relative importance and effects on measured elemental ratios. It is shown that the removal of silicate contamination is the most important step for the measurement of Mg/Ca ratios. In an example, bulk sample Mg/Ca decreases from 10.5 to 2.5 mmol mol?1 during clay removal. Oxidation of organic material causes a lowering of sample Mg/Ca in the order of 10{\%} or approximately 1°C when converted to temperature. Use of dilute acid leaching to remove adsorbed contaminants causes partial dissolution of the sample carbonate and a corresponding decrease in Mg/Ca. Reductive treatment also causes dissolution of the sample and a decrease in the Mg/Ca ratio of up to 10–15{\%}. Sample preparation for Sr/Ca analysis does not require the same degree of rigor as is necessary for Mg/Ca work. The “within-run” reproducibility of the method described here for G. ruber in a core-top sample from the Arabian Sea was ±1.8{\%} (mean sample ratio was 4.72 mmol mol?1). When converted to temperature, this becomes 28 ± 0.2°C. The equivalent result for Sr/Ca was ±0.5{\%} (mean ratio = 1.44 mmol mol?1).},

abstract = {Growth and calcification of the marine coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi is affected by ocean acidification and macronutrients limitation and its response varies between strains. Here we investigated the physiological performance of a highly calcified E. huxleyi strain, NZEH, in a multiparametric experiment. Cells were exposed to different CO2 levels (ranging from 250 to 1314 $\mu$atm) under three nutrient conditions [nutrient replete (R), nitrate limited (-N), and phosphate limited (-P)]. We focused on calcite and organic carbon quotas and on nitrate and phosphate utilization by analyzing the activity of nitrate reductase (NRase) and alkaline phosphatase (APase), respectively. Particulate inorganic (PIC) and organic (POC) carbon quotas increased with increasing CO2 under R conditions but a different pattern was observed under nutrient limitation. The PIC:POC ratio decreased with increasing CO2 in nutrient limited cultures. Coccolith length increased with CO2 under all nutrient conditions but the coccosphere volume varied depending on the nutrient treatment. Maximum APase activity was found at 561 $\mu$atm of CO2 (pH 7.92) in -P cultures and in R conditions, NRase activity increased linearly with CO2. These results suggest that E. huxleyi's competitive ability for nutrient uptake might be altered in future high-CO2 oceans. The combined dataset will be useful in model parameterizations of the carbon cycle and ocean acidification.},

abstract = {The position-dependent specification of the hair and non-hair cell types in the Arabidopsis root epidermis provides a simple model for the study of cell fate determination in plants. Several putative transcriptional regulators are known to influence this cell fate decision. Indirect evidence from studies with the maize R gene has been used to suggest that a bHLH transcription factor also participates in this process. We show that two Arabidopsis genes encoding bHLH proteins, GLABRA3 (GL3) and ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3), act in a partially redundant manner to specify root epidermal cell fates. Plants homozygous for mutations in both genes fail to specify the non-hair cell type, whereas plants overexpressing either gene produce ectopic non-hair cells. We also find that these genes are required for appropriate transcription of the non-hair specification gene GL2 and the hair cell specification gene CPC, showing that GL3 and EGL3 influence both epidermal cell fates. Furthermore, we show that these bHLH proteins require a functional WER MYB protein for their action, and they physically interact with WER and CPC in the yeast two-hybrid assay. These results suggest a model in which GL3 and EGL3 act together with WER in the N cell position to promote the non-hair cell fate, whereas they interact with the incomplete MYB protein CPC in the H position, which blocks the non-hair pathway and leads to the hair cell fate.},

Methyl and ethyl ketones were present in both cell types. The proportion of phospholipids and glycolipids increased during the log-phase, while neutral lipids (free fatty acids, triacylglycerols, ketones and hydrocarbons) achieved their highest levels in the late stationary-phase. The polar lipids of both cell types were very rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). In sulphoquinovosylglyercol + phosphatidylethanolamine, 18:3n-3 and 18:4n-3 were the predominant fatty acids totalling 42.4–55.7{\%}, while 18:5n-3 (33.1–79.2{\%}) was the main fatty acid in digalactosyldiacylglycerols. This fatty acid was also predominant in monogalactosydiacylglycerols (36.6–57.7{\%}), with lesser amounts of 18:4n-3 and 22:6n-3. Phosphatidylcholine was dominated by two molecular species, 22:6n-3/22:6n-3 and 14:0/22:6n-3, accounting for 25.7–33.7 and 42.0–58.3{\%}, respectively. Changes in PUFA composition over the growth cycle were small. The C18 PUFA associated with thylakoid glycolipids tended to increase during the log-phase and decreased in the late stationary-phase while 22:6n-3 peaked in the late stationary-phase.

abstract = {Many living organisms contain biominerals and composites with finely tuned properties, reflecting a remarkable level of control over the nucleation, growth and shape of the constituent crystals. Peptides and proteins play an important role in achieving this control. But the general view that organic molecules affect mineralization through stereochemical recognition, where geometrical and chemical constraints dictate their binding to a mineral, seems difficult to reconcile with a mechanistic understanding, where crystallization is controlled by thermodynamic and kinetic factors. Indeed, traditional crystal growth models emphasize the inhibiting effect of so-called 'modifiers' on surface-step growth, rather than stereochemical matching to newly expressed crystal facets. Here we report in situ atomic force microscope observations and molecular modelling studies of calcite growth in the presence of chiral amino acids that reconcile these two seemingly divergent views. We find that enantiomer-specific binding of the amino acids to those surface-step edges that offer the best geometric and chemical fit changes the step-edge free energies, which in turn results in macroscopic crystal shape modifications. Our results emphasize that the mechanism underlying crystal modification through organic molecules is best understood by considering both stereochemical recognition and the effects of binding on the interfacial energies of the growing crystal.},

abstract = {The operation of the carbon cycle forms an important part of the processes relevant to future changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide. The balance of carbon between terrestrial and oceanic reservoirs is an important factor and here we focus in particular on the oceans. Future changes in the carbon cycle that may affect air-sea partitioning of CO(2) are difficult to quantify but the palaeoceanographic record and modern observational studies provide important evidence of what variations might occur. These include changes in surface nutrient use, the oceanic inventory of nutrients, and the elemental composition and rain-rate ratio of marine particles. Recent work has identified two inter-linked processes of potential importance that we consider in some detail: the response of marine calcification to changes in surface water CO(2) and the association of particulate organic carbon with ballast minerals, in particular biogenic calcite. We review evidence from corals, coccolithophores and foraminifera, which suggests that the response of reduced calcification provides a negative feedback on rising atmospheric CO(2). We then use a box model to demonstrate how the calcification response may affect the organic carbon rain rate through the ballast effect. The ballast effect on export fluxes of organic and inorganic carbon acts to counteract the negative calcification response to increased CO(2). Thus, two oceanic buffers exert a significant control on ocean-atmosphere carbonate chemistry: the thermodynamic CO(2) buffer; and the ballast/calcification buffer. Just how tightly coupled the rain-rate ratio of CaCO(3)/C(org) is to fluxes of ballast minerals is an important question for future research.},

abstract = {This study presents a new approach to coral thermometry that deconvolves the influence of water temperature on skeleton composition from that of " vital effects", and has the potential to provide estimates of growth temperatures that are accurate to within a few tenths of a degree Celsius from both tropical and cold-water corals. Our results provide support for a physico-chemical model of coral biomineralization, and imply that Mg2+ substitutes directly for Ca2+ in biogenic aragonite. Recent studies have identified Rayleigh fractionation as an important influence on the elemental composition of coral skeletons. Daily, seasonal and interannual variations in the amount of aragonite precipitated by corals from each " batch" of calcifying fluid can explain why the temperature dependencies of elemental ratios in coral skeleton differ from those of abiogenic aragonites, and are highly variable among individual corals. On the basis of this new insight into the origin of " vital effects" in coral skeleton, we developed a Rayleigh-based, multi-element approach to coral thermometry. Temperature is resolved from the Rayleigh fractionation signal by combining information from multiple element ratios (e.g., Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca) to produce a mathematically over-constrained system of Rayleigh equations. Unlike conventional coral thermometers, this approach does not rely on an initial calibration of coral skeletal composition to an instrumental temperature record. Rather, considering coral skeletogenesis as a biologically mediated, physico-chemical process provides a means to extract temperature information from the skeleton composition using the Rayleigh equation and a set of experimentally determined partition coefficients. Because this approach is based on a quantitative understanding of the mechanism that produces the " vital effect" it should be possible to apply it both across scleractinian species and to corals growing in vastly different environments. Where instrumental temperature records are available, a Rayleigh-based framework allows the effects of stress on coral calcification to be identified on the basis of anomalies in the skeletal composition. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {If the observed distribution of dissolved oxygen in deep oceans below the euphotic zone is in stationary and steady state, then it can be assumed that the in situ consumption of oxygen is balanced by ‘ventilation', or, in other words, physical transport of oxygen from regions of higher dissolved oxygen and ultimately the sea surface. It follows, therefore, that measurement or determination of those physical transport processes, coupled with observation of the oxygen distribution will lead to an estimate of the net oxygen utilization rate (OUR). The character of such an estimate is that it is a space and time average over scales governed by the nature (space and time scales) of the transport processes, the scale of the oxygen distribution, and the climatologic nature of the system. As such, one obtains an average which is characteristically of the order of 108 s, 108 cm or more, that is large compared with scales of biological variability. I report here some new determinations of oxygen utilization rates determined by tritium dating in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, compare them with other and previous estimates, and discuss their implications regarding primary production and nutrient cycling in an oligotrophic system.},

abstract = {In this study we make the first attempt to inter-calibrate boron isotope (??11B) measurements on marine biogenic carbonates measured by four different laboratories, each using a different analytical technique. The importance of such calibrations lies in the major implications of relatively small changes in ??11B ({\textless}2???), which are typical of palaeoclimate applications of the ??11B-pH proxy. Despite the variety of mass spectrometric techniques used by the different laboratories in this study (two variants of negative ion thermal ionisation mass spectrometry and two variants of multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry), for samples without a complex sample matrix, such as boric acid, there are no significant interlaboratory biases: the pooled 2sd of these samples is 0.39???, which is within the measurement uncertainties reported by each laboratory (which range between 0.18 and 0.80???). For seawater, a common in-house reference material, we find a similarly good agreement (??11B=39.65??0.41???, 2sd) despite four different sample preparation procedures. Reported ??11B for calcium carbonate samples have a pooled 2sd of 1.46???, which is larger than the measurement uncertainty reported by each laboratory. We have attempted to identify the source of this interlaboratory variability, and find that overall sample size (in terms of available B) and B/Ca ratio (i.e. amount of boron relative to matrix) may play a role, but the exact mechanisms remain uncertain. Observed variations in reported ??11B for the CaCO3 samples are, however, relatively systematic for each laboratory for a given sample matrix (i.e. similar B/Ca and amount of boron for analysis). This implies that relative differences in ??11B in a sample set of a given matrix can be reconstructed by the four laboratories involved in this study more accurately than the absolute boron isotope ratios. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Schmittner2013,
abstract = {Analysis of observations and sensitivity experiments with a new three-dimensional global model of stable carbon isotope cycling elucidate processes that control the distribution of delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the contemporary and preindustrial ocean. Biological fractionation and the sinking of isotopically light delta C-13 organic matter from the surface into the interior ocean leads to low delta C-13(DIC) values at depths and in high latitude surface waters and high values in the upper ocean at low latitudes with maxima in the subtropics. Air-sea gas exchange has two effects. First, it acts to reduce the spatial gradients created by biology. Second, the associated temperature-dependent fractionation tends to increase (decrease) delta C-13(DIC) values of colder (warmer) water, which generates gradients that oppose those arising from biology. Our model results suggest that both effects are similarly important in influencing surface and interior delta C-13(DIC) distributions. However, since air-sea gas exchange is slow in the modern ocean, the biological effect dominates spatial delta C-13(DIC) gradients both in the interior and at the surface, in contrast to conclusions from some previous studies. Calcium carbonate cycling, pH dependency of fractionation during air-sea gas exchange, and kinetic fractionation have minor effects on delta C-13(DIC). Accumulation of isotopically light carbon from anthropogenic fossil fuel burning has decreased the spatial variability of surface and deep delta C-13(DIC) since the industrial revolution in our model simulations. Analysis of a new synthesis of delta C-13(DIC) measurements from years 1990 to 2005 is used to quantify preformed and remineralized contributions as well as the effects of biology and air-sea gas exchange. The model reproduces major features of the observed large-scale distribution of delta C-13(DIC) as well as the individual contributions and effects. Residual misfits are documented and analyzed. Simulated surface and subsurface delta C-13(DIC) are influenced by details of the ecosystem model formulation. For example, inclusion of a simple parameterization of iron limitation of phytoplankton growth rates and temperature-dependent zooplankton grazing rates improves the agreement with delta C-13(DIC) observations and satellite estimates of phytoplankton growth rates and biomass, suggesting that delta C-13 can also be a useful test of ecosystem models.},

In order to better understand how the sample surface can affect the measured XANES spectra, special attention was paid to the glass surface (i.e., fresh vs. "old" surfaces but also surfaces vs. powders) and to the detection mode (fluorescence vs. electron yield). We observe that, at the Na K-edge, XANES experiments on glass compositions with high Na/Al ratios must be performed on highly "fresh" surfaces (i.e., at most a couple of hours old). In these compositions, the collected XANES may show features that are relevant to major structural reorganization near the surface (carbonate-like re-organizations).

abstract = {There are at least four distinct ways in which familiar landmarks aid an insect on its trips between nest and foraging site. Recognising scenes: when bees are displaced unexpectedly from their hive to one of several familiar locations, they are able to head in the direction of home as though they had previously linked an appropriate directional vector to a view of the scene at the release site. Biased detours: ants recognise familiar landmarks en route and will correct their path by steering consistently to the left or to the right around them. Aiming at beacons: bees and ants also guide their path by approaching familiar landmarks lying on or close to the direct line between start and finish. Simulations suggest that such mechanisms acting together may suffice to account for the routes taken by desert ants through a landmark-strewn environment: the stereotyped trajectories of individual ants can be modelled by a weighted combination of dead reckoning, biased detours and beacon-aiming. These mechanisms guide an insect sufficiently close to an inconspicuous goal for image matching to be successfully employed to locate it. Insects then move until their current retinal image matches a stored view of the surrounding panorama seen from a vantage point close to the goal. Bees and wasps perform learning flights on their first departure from a site to which they will return. These flights seem to be designed to pick up the information needed for several navigational strategies. Thus, a large portion of the learning flight of a bee leaving a feeder tends to be spent close to the feeder so aiding the acquisition of a view from that vantage point, as is needed for image matching. Bees and social wasps also tend to inspect their surroundings while facing along preferred directions and to adopt similar bearings before landing, thereby making it easy to employ retinotopically stored patterns in image matching. Aiming at beacons, in contrast, requires a landmark to be familiar to the frontal retina. Objects tend to be viewed frontally while the insect circles through arcs centred on the goal. This procedure may help insects to pick out those objects close to the goal that are best suited for guiding later returns.},

abstract = {The quality of element image maps generated by laser ablation (LA) ICPMS rastering depends on the measurement conditions (laser fluence, repetition rate, beam diameter, scanning speed, flow rate, and acquisition time). Optimizing these conditions is often a matter of trial and error since the quality criteria for elemental imaging (sensitivity, spatial resolution, noise, and analysis time) are intricately linked. A simple mathematical model, and ensuing software, was developed to simulate the LA-ICPMS output upon virtual rastering of a digital image of a cross-section of a sample. Even though the LA-ICPMS map is not directly correlated with elemental imaging, element distributions are often related to visual features in the sample, allowing optimization of the LA-ICPMS settings for the desired quality criteria (samples without any visual features can not be optimized in this way). The virtual LA-ICPMS rastering software assumes that the ablation cell and tube interface act as a continuous stirred-tank reactor (i.e., exponential washout) and a plug flow reactor (i.e., zero dispersion), respectively, using an inert gas for transport of the aerosol particles. The software also incorporates a random noise generator which simulates the experimentally deduced signal-to-noise ratios as a function of the anticipated concentration and LA-ICPMS settings. The software was successfully validated and demonstrated by comparing the software output of selected patterns created in the emulsion of a black-and-white negative film with the experimental rastering output performed by measurement of 107Ag in the emulsion.},

abstract = {We have investigated the performance of a combined single-collector sector-field ICP-MS and a new solid-state 193 nm Nd:YAG laser ablation system for trace element analysis of geological glasses. Experiments were made with certified MPI-DING, USGS and NIST reference glasses. Two different measurement protocols were used: the conventional three-spot analysis (spot sizes: 50-100 [small mu ]m) for the determination of 26 trace elements using a combination of magnetic (Bscan) and electrical scan (Escan) modes and the major element Ca as internal standard (protocol 1), and a high-precision technique for the determination of three elements using the fast Escan at a constant magnetic field and a trace element as internal standard (protocol 2). We obtained a precision (1 RSD) of element ratio measurements of about 0.8{\%} (protocol 1) and 0.2{\%} (protocol 2), which is better than that obtained using a 213 nm Nd:YAG laser (about 1.1{\%} and 0.6{\%}, respectively). The mean reproducibility (1 RSD) of trace element data obtained over a period of three months was about 2{\%} (100 [small mu ]m spot size) and 3{\%} (50 [small mu ]m spot size). The detection efficiencies of the mass spectrometer for elements with = 37 (Rb)-92 (U) range between 0.2 [times] 10 and 2 [times] 10 detected ions/ablated atoms. They are about 40{\%} higher than those using a 213 nm laser because of lower sample consumption of the 193 nm laser ablation system ( 0.05 [small mu ]m ablation per shot). Detection limits decrease with increasing atomic number; they range between 0.1 [small mu ]g g (Rb) and 0.0003 [small mu ]g g (U). We also investigated element fractionation and possible matrix effects, which may bias the analytical results. Element fractionation for the 193 nm laser is lower than for the 213 nm laser. Low (percent range), but significantly different fractionation factors of some elements (, Rb, Y, Pb) for glasses having different major element compositions are observed. Highly accurate LA-ICP-MS analyses therefore require suitable reference materials of similar matrices. The eight MPI-DING glasses having different major element compositions seem to be such samples for geoanalytical work. The basaltic KL2-G glass and the komatiitic GOR132-G glass were used for calibration of six basaltic and one komatiitic reference glasses, respectively. Most LA-ICP-MS data agree with published compilation values and isotope dilution data within 95{\%} confidence limits.},

abstract = {This paper looks at coastal and estuarine ecosystems in terms of their unique biodiversity characteristics and the implications of these characteristics for management. With the exception of coral and other reef communities, coastal and estuarine systems are generally low in species diversity. But estuaries are typically dominated by strong aperiodic physical forces (e.g. salinity changes due to freshwater inflows, storm events) and under these conditions structure is more difficult to build and maintain. Estuaries are also characterized by a high degree of organism mobility. These characteristics point to a high degree of ecosystem resilience. The general hypothesis is that the biodiversity achievable in a system is a function of the predictability and scales of its physical environment. This hypothesis is consistent with the limited data on diversity in estuaries and other systems, and can be further tested in the future via comparative analysis. These ideas are elaborated and extrapolated to the task of managing complex and coupled ecological economic systems. Biological or species diversity is put in a systems context as a scale-dependent measure of an important system characteristic. In estuaries it is the diversity of ecological processes, and in particular certain keystone processes, that are more critical and that should be the focus of management efforts. Effective management is seen as the process of escaping from social traps that occur when local, individual incentives diverge from global, long-term goals.},

abstract = {Active human carbonic anhydrase II (HCAII) protein was expressed in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC7942 by means of transformation with the bidirectional expression vector, pCA. This expression was driven by the bacterial Tac promoter and was regulated by the IacIQ repressor protein, which was expressed from the same plasmid. Expression levels reached values of around 0.3{\%} of total cell protein and this protein appeared to be entirely soluble in nature and located within the cytosol of the cell. The expression of this protein has dramatic effects on the photosynthetic physiology of the cell. Induction of expression of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in both high dissolved inorganic carbon (C(i)) and low C(i) grown cells leads the creation of a high C(i) requiring phenotype causing: (a) a dramatic increase in the K(0.5) (C(i)) for photosynthesis, (b) a loss of the ability to accumulate internal C(i), and (c) a decrease in the lag between the initial C(i) accumulation following illumination and the efflux of CO(2) from the cells. In addition, the effects of the expressed CA can largely be reversed by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ethoxyzolamide. As a result of the above findings, it is concluded that the CO(2) concentrating mechanism in Synechococcus PCC7942 is largely dependent on (a) the absence of CA activity from the cytosol, and (b) the specific localization of CA activity in the carboxysome. A theoretical model of photosynthesis and C(i) accumulation is developed in which the carboxysome plays a central role as both the site of CO(2) generation from HCO(3(-) ) and a resistance barrier to CO(2) efflux from the cell.

abstract = {Cation transport during skeletal growth is a key process controlling metal/calcium (Me/Ca) paleoproxy behavior in coral. To characterize this transport, cultured corals were transferred into seawater enriched in the rare earth element Tb 3+ as well as stable isotopes of calcium, strontium, and barium. Subsequent NanoSIMS ion images of each coral skeleton were used to follow uptake dynamics. These images show a continuous region corresponding to new growth that is homogeneously enriched in each tracer. Isotope ratio profiles across the new growth boundary transition rapidly from natural abundance ratios to a ratio matching the enriched culture solution. The location of this transition is the same for each element, within analytical resolution. The synchronous incorporation of all these cations, including the dissimilar ion terbium, which has no known biological function in coral, suggests that: (1) there is cation exchange between seawater and the calcifying fluid, and (2) these elements are influenced by similar transport mechanisms consistent with direct and rapid seawater transport to the site of calcification. Measured using isotope ratio profiles, seawater transport rates differ from place to place on the growing coral skeleton, with calcifying fluid turnover times from 30min to 5.7h. Despite these differences, all the elements measured in this study show the same transport dynamics at each location. Using an analytical geochemical model of biomineralization that includes direct seawater transport we constrain the role of active calcium pumping during calcification and we show that the balance between seawater transport and precipitation can explain observed Me/Ca variability in deep-sea coral. ?? 2012 .},

abstract = {The primordial earth surface exposed minerals comprised mainly of carbonates, silicates and smaller amounts of phosphates. Weathering eventually led to the dissolution of the surface rock and the leaching of their components into the rivers, lakes and oceans. There, complex chemistry depending upon the temperature, pH, pressure, and atmospheric carbon dioxide content led to the reprecipitation of the dissolved minerals into new forms as part of the sedimentary rock. The minerals themselves could be transformed by passive diagenesis to further structures. When primitive organisms emerged, they added a very significant component to the processing of the dissolved mineral constituents in the marine environment, where both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms have the ability to produce mineralized skeletal elements and mineralized fecal pellets that also accumulate in the marine sediments. The increasing diversity of plant and animal life has continually accelerated the dynamic relationship between the composition of the earths crust and the living world. The resulting minerals of biogenic origin comprise a surprisingly large portion of the earths crust, and represent a huge reservoir of sequestered carbonate, silicate and phosphate ions. The majority of the carbonates appear as calcite or aragonite, produced principally by plankton, invertebrates and so on, while the phosphates, as carbonated hydroxyapatite, are the products of vertebrates as well as the weathering of igneous rock. This chapter is focused on the mechanisms of formation of the vertebrate mineralized structures; bone, tooth enamel, tooth dentin and otoliths. Although other Chapters deal explicitly with the invertebrate and bacterial systems, we need to consider if there are any general considerations that apply to all biogenic mineralization systems. We shall begin from that perspective and inquire as to the way by which living organisms can organize their mineral phases into such complex and specific structures. BIOMINERALIZATION:},

abstract = {The privatisation of the water industry has been a success story. Since the public regional water authorities became private companies in 1989, the industry has invested over {\pounds}90 billion to reduce its impact on nature and to continue to delivery high quality, affordable drinking water. So why do we need a white paper about water? Because the truth is that in some areas of England our water supplies are already under stress. Because, despite a dramatic improvement in the health of many of our rivers, only a quarter of our water bodies are fully functioning ecosystems. And because, in the coming years, the combined effects of climate change and a growing population are likely to put an increasing pressure on water quality, and on our water supplies. We think of water as free, falling form the sky in abundance. It is only when rivers start to run dry, reservoirs fall low, cracks emerge in the ground that the old certainties are shaken. These are warning signs of what we might expect to see in a changing climate. We cannot do without water. It is in many ways our most precious resource. So we must act now to make the changes needed to keep our rivers flowing and our water supplies reliable and affordable. This White paper describes a vision for future water management in which the water sector is resilient, in which water companies are more efficient and customer focused, and in which water is valued as the precious resource it is. And it explains that we all have a part to play in the realisation of this vision.},

abstract = {Abstract. Higher trophic level species such as parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens are frequently ignored in community studies, despite playing key roles in the structure, function, and stability of ecological communities. Furthermore, such species are typically among the last in a community to reestablish due to their reliance upon lower trophic level resources and a requirement for persistent, stable ecological conditions. Consequently their presence alone can be indicative of healthy ecosystems. Using replicated, quantitative food webs we studied the impacts of a restoration treatment upon the interactions of a tri-trophic community consisting of plants, their bumble bee pollinators, and the parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens of the bumble bees at heathland sites. We found the lower trophic levels of the community successfully reinstated at restored relative to control sites. However the abundance, load per host, prevalence of parasitism, prevalence of superparasitism, and host range of a key dipteran parasitoid of the family Conopidae were all significantly reduced in restored heathlands. Potential causes for this incomplete reestablishment at restored sites include the lag in floral resources due to differences in floral species composition, and the reduced ability of this parasitoid species in accessing host resources relative to other natural enemy species present in these communities. Moreover the incomplete reinstatement of the natural enemy community was found to significantly reduce levels of network vulnerability (a measure of how vulnerable prey is to being consumed) at restored sites relative to ancient, control networks.},

abstract = {Because of rapid increases in population, anthropogenic sources of nitrogen have adversely impacted the water quality of coastal ponds on Cape Cod. A major source of "new" nitrogen to these estuaries is groundwater, which intercepts septic tank fields in its flow path to the coastline. Many attempts have been made to quantify this process; however, groundwater discharge is often patchy in nature and is therefore difficult to study by use of traditional techniques such as seepage meters. In Waquoit Bay, MA, we tested an approach based on radium, which is naturally enriched in aquifer fluids and has four isotopes with half-lives ranging from 4 d to 1600 yr. Groundwater entering the bay was low in salinity and contained several orders of magnitude greater radium and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) relative to ambient bay water. Using a mass-balance approach for radium, we calculated a submarine groundwater flux of ‚{\`{a}}{\textordmasculine}37,000 m3 d-1, which compared well with aquifer recharge rates calculated from rainfall. From the DIN content of the groundwater, we estimated that ‚{\`{a}}{\textordmasculine}2100 mol N d-1 was directly input to the estuary. However, this nitrogen flux was small in comparison with literature values for DIN fluxes from the heavily populated subestuaries. Furthermore, our results suggest that groundwater flux of DIN was assimilated by plant biomass during the summer but may be exported from the embayment to coastal waters during the winter months.},

This article explores how the use of genomics-based tools that measure gene expression—DNA microarrays and quantitative PCR—can assist in this effort and reveal aspects of how calcifying marine organisms will respond to ocean acidification. More specifically, what stands to be gained from this approach is an understanding of the direct effects of ocean acidification and whether organisms have sufficient physiological plasticity to adapt to the altered CO2 conditions. We provide a brief overview of biomineralization processes in corals and sea urchin larvae, and then link these pathways to ways in which gene expression analysis can reveal physiological responses and mechanisms, and further, can define new testable hypotheses. In addition, we review the resources available and strategies that might be taken for each of 2 study organisms, stony corals and sea urchins. Finally, we suggest strategies for gene expression profiling in organisms that differ in availability of genomic resources.},

abstract = {Recent discoveries define a global scale fluid reservoir residing within the uppermost igneous oceanic crust, a region of seafloor that is both warm and may harbor a substantial biosphere. This hydrothermal fluid reservoir formed initially within volcanic rocks newly erupted at mid-ocean ridges, but extends to the vastly larger and older ridge flanks. Upper oceanic crust is porous and permeable due to the presence of lava drainbacks, fissuring, and inter-unit voids, and this porosity and permeability allows active fluid circulation to advect measurable quantities of lithospheric heat from the crust to an average age of 65 Myr. A compilation of crustal porosities shows that this fluid reservoir contains nearly 2{\%} of the total volume of global seawater. Heat flow and sediment thickness data allow calculation of reservoir temperatures, predicting 40??C mean temperatures in Cretaceous crust. Utilizing these temperature estimates, heat flow measurements and models for the thermal structure and evolution of the oceanic lithosphere, we have computed mean hydrothermal fluxes into the deep ocean as a function of plate age. The total hydrothermal volume flux into the oceans approaches 20{\%} of the total riverine input and may contribute to the global seawater mass balance. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ACC (amorphous calcium carbonate) plays an important role in biomineralization process for its function as a precursor for calcium carbonate biominerals. However, it is unclear how biomacromolecules regulate the formation of ACC precursor in vivo. In the present study, we used biochemical experiments coupled with bioinformatics approaches to explore the mechanisms of ACC formation controlled by ACCBP (ACC-binding protein). Size-exclusion chromatography, chemical cross-linking experiments and negative staining electron microscopy reveal that ACCBP is a decamer composed of two adjacent pentamers. Sequence analyses and fluorescence quenching results indicate that ACCBP contains two Ca(2)(+)-binding sites. The results of in vitro crystallization experiments suggest that one Ca(2)(+)-binding site is critical for ACC formation and the other site affects the ACC induction efficiency. Homology modelling demonstrates that the Ca(2)(+)-binding sites of pentameric ACCBP are arranged in a 5-fold symmetry, which is the structural basis for ACC formation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the structural basis for protein-induced ACC formation and it will significantly improve our understanding of the amorphous precursor pathway.},

The DSDP sites are located on the Walvis Ridge (Site 363), in the Angola Basin (Sites 522, 523), the Brazil Basin (Site 19, Hole 20C) and on the Rio Grande Rise (Site 357). In abyssal sites of the South Atlantic the Eocene bottom water environment can be divided into two distinct regimes - the early eocene and the late Eocene. The middle Eocene is transitional. Faunal distribution pattern indicate that source areas where bottom water formed were probably different between the two regimes. During the early Eocene warm, saline water formed possibly in the Tethyan Ocean "(east of Gibraltar)". There is good evidence that the late Eocene bottom water of the South Atlantic, recorded at lower bathyal down to middle abyssal environments, was formed in southern high latitude regions. First invasion of cooler bottom water is recorded at upper abyssal depths around 46 Ma (earliest Zone P12; Site 19). From 40 Ma (late Zone P15) onwards this signal is recorded at all sites except middle bathyal depth Site 357. Selected faunal parameters allow reconstruction of bottom water oxygenation.

abstract = {The Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios of many biogenic skeletons provide useful paleotemperature estimates. As yet however, it has remained largely impossible to obtain such information from bivalve shells. In the present study, metal-to-calcium values in the hinge plate (aragonite, outer shell layer) of four ontogenetically old (85 to 374year-old) specimens of the long-lived bivalve, Arctica islandica, were measured on a LA-ICP-MS. The shells were collected alive in 1868, 1986 and 2003 from three different localities around Iceland. With increasing ontogenetic age and decreasing growth rate, a distinct trend toward increasing Sr/Ca (max. 5.17mmol/mol) and Mg/Ca values (max. 0.89mmol/mol) and greater variance were observed. Three potential explanations for these trends include a reduced capacity for element selection due to cell ageing, changing metabolism and/or a relative increase in the number of organic-rich (=Mg-rich) and organic-poor (=Sr-rich) shell portions through ontogeny. Partition coefficients however, remained far below 1, indicating that physiology exerted a strong control over the element partitioning between the shells and the ambient water. After mathematical elimination of these vital effects, residuals exhibited a highly significant negative correlation (e.g., age-detrended Sr/Ca data: R=-0.64, R2=0.41, p{\textless}0.0001, growth rate-detrended Mg/Ca data: R=-0.52, R2=0.27, p{\textless}0.0001) with sea surface temperature.

abstract = {Despite the importance of boron as a proxy of past ocean pH, the crystal-chemical factors controlling its incorporation in the structure of calcium carbonates are still poorly understood. This is partly linked to an imperfect knowledge of the coordination, protonation state and local environment of boron species in these minerals. In the present study, we use first-principles quantum mechanical tools to model selected trigonal and tetragonal boron species in calcite and aragonite. The stable geometry of the models is obtained from standard energy minimization schemes or using a more advanced metadynamics exploration of their configurational space. The computation of 11B NMR chemical shifts and quadrupolar coupling parameters enables a straightforward comparison of the models to existing experimental NMR data. The results show that B in calcium carbonates does occur as structural species substituted for CO32??? anions. The B speciation depends on the polymorph considered. In calcite, structural boron is present as partially deprotonated trigonal BO2(OH)2??? species coexisting with a fraction of substituted B(OH)4??? groups. In aragonite, the B(OH)4??? substitution for CO32??? anions is dominant. Different species, including entrapped B(OH)3 molecules and substituted BO33??? groups also occur in biogenic samples. The diversity of B speciation reflects a diversity of B incorporation mechanisms and sheds light on previous studies confronting B isotopic composition determination with NMR observations. The mechanisms of boron incorporation in calcium carbonates are probably more complex than usually assumed in the literature using boron isotopes as a proxy of paleo-atmospheric CO2 reconstructions. Although not invalidating the empirical paleo-pH proxy, these results call for a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of boron incorporation in carbonates.},

abstract = {Plant cystoliths are mineralized objects that are formed by specialized cells in the leaves of certain plants. The main mineral component of cystoliths by volume is amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) and the minor component is silica. We show that the silica stalk is formed first and is essential for ACC formation. Furthermore, the cystolith is shown to be composed of four distinct mineral phases with different chemical properties: an almost pure silica phase grades into a Mg-rich silica phase. This Mg-rich silica is overlaid by a relatively stable ACC phase. A bulky and less stable ACC phase encapsulates the first ACC phase. This architecture poses interesting questions about the role of Mg in the silica phase and suggests a strategy for ACC stabilization that takes advantage of a precise regulation of the mineral-growth microenvironment.},

abstract = {In the modern oceans, the removal of dissolved silica from sea water is principally a biological process carried out by diatoms, with lesser contributions from radiolaria, silicoflagellates, and sponges. Because such silica in sediments is often redistributed locally during diagenesis to from nodular or bedded chert, stratigraphic changes in the facies distribution of early diagenetic chert provide important insights into the development of biological participation in the silica cycle. The abundance of chert in upper Proterozoic peritidal carbonates suggests that at this time silica was removed from seawater principally by abiological processes operating in part of the margins of the oceans. With the evolution of demosponges near the beginning of the Cambrian Period, subtidal biogenetic cherts became increasingly common, and with the Ordovician rise of radiolaria to ecological and biogeochemical prominence, sedimented skeletons became a principal sink for oceanic silica. Cherts of Silurian to Cretaceous age share many features of facies distribution and petrography but they differ from Cenozoic siliceous deposits. These differences are interpreted to reflect the mid-Cretaceous radiation of diatoms and their subsequent rise to domination of the silica cycle. Biogeochemical cycles provide an important framework for the paleobiological interpretation of the organisms that participate in them.},

Prenucleation clusters are solutes with "molecular" character in aqueous solution. It becomes evident that the stable clusters may have been concealed by the so-called ion pair concept and activity effects. We show that non-classical nucleation via stable prenucleation clusters is a highly valuable concept for a novel understanding of phenomena observed in bio- and biomimetic mineralization, which however may hardly be rationalized by means of classical nucleation theory.

Analyses of satellite-derived phytoplankton concentration (available since 1979) have suggested decadal-scale fluctuations linked to climate forcing, but the length of this record is insufficient to resolve longer-term trends. Here we combine available ocean transparency measurements and in situ chlorophyll observations to estimate the time dependence of phytoplankton biomass at local, regional and global scales since 1899. We observe declines in eight out of ten ocean regions, and estimate a global rate of decline of approximately 1{\%} of the global median per year. Our analyses further reveal interannual to decadal phytoplankton fluctuations superimposed on long-term trends. These fluctuations are strongly correlated with basin-scale climate indices, whereas long-term declining trends are related to increasing sea surface temperatures. We conclude that global phytoplankton concentration has declined over the past century; this decline will need to be considered in future studies of marine ecosystems, geochemical cycling, ocean circulation and fisheries.},

abstract = {The rapid formation of calcium carbonate coral skeletons (calcification) fuelled by the coral-algal symbiosis is the backbone of tropical coral reef ecosystems. However, the efficacy of calcification is measurably influenced by the sea's physico-chemical environment, which is changing rapidly. Warming oceans have already led to increased frequency and severity of coral bleaching, and ocean acidification has a demonstrable potential to cause reduced rates of calcification. There is now general agreement that ocean warming and acidification are attributable to human activities increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and the large part of the extra carbon dioxide (the main greenhouse gas) that is absorbed by oceans. Certain massive corals provide historical perspectives on calcification through the presence of dateable annual density banding patterns. Each band is a page in an environmental archive that reveals past responses of growth (linear extension, skeletal density and calcification rate) and provides a basis for prediction of future of coral growth. A second major line of research focuses on the measurement of various geochemical tracers incorporated into the growth bands, allowing the reconstruction of past marine climate conditions (i.e. palaeoclimatology). Here, we focus on the structural properties of the annual density bands themselves (viz. density; linear extension), exploring their utility in providing both perspectives on the past and pointers to the future of calcification on coral reefs. We conclude that these types of coral growth records, though relatively neglected in recent years compared to the geochemical studies, remain immensely valuable aids to unravelling the consequences of anthropogenic climate change on coral reefs. Moreover, an understanding of coral growth processes is an essential pre-requisite for proper interpretation of studies of geochemical tracers in corals. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The boron isotope composition of marine carbonates is considered to be a seawater pH proxy. Nevertheless, the use of ??11B has some limitations such as the knowledge of the fractionation factor (??4-3) between boric acid and the borate ion and the amplitude of "vital effects" on this proxy that are not well constrained. Using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) we have examined the internal variability of the boron isotope ratio in the shallow water, symbionts bearing foraminiferan Amphistegina lobifera. Specimens were cultured at constant temperature (24 ?? 0.1 ??C) in seawater with pH ranging between 7.90 and 8.45. Intra-shell boron isotopes showed large variability with an upper limit value of ???30???. Our results suggest that the fractionation factor ??4-3 of 0.97352 (Klochko et al., 2006) is in better agreement with our experiments and with direct pH measurements in seawater vacuoles associated with the biomineralization process in these foraminifera. Despite the large variability of the skeletal pH values in each cultured specimen, it is possible to link the lowest calculated pH values to the experimental culture pH values while the upper pH limit is slightly below 9. This variability can be interpreted as follows: foraminifera variably increase the pH at the biomineralization site to about 9. This increase above ambient seawater pH leads to a range in ??11B (??11B) for each seawater pH. This ??11B is linearly correlated with the culture seawater pH with a slope of -13.1 per pH unit, and is independent of the fractionation factor ??4-3, or the ??11Bsw through time. It may also be independent of the pKB (the dissociation constant of boric acid) value. Therefore, ??11B in foraminifera can potentially reconstruct paleo-pH of seawater. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Networks with different evolutionary histories proved equally capable of evolving to recognize the call of the t{\'{u}}ngara frog, Physalaemus pustulosus, but exhibited distinct responses to novel stimuli. History influenced the ability of networks to predict known responses of t{\'{u}}ngara frogs; network accuracy was determined by how closely the network history approximated the hypothesized history of the t{\'{u}}ngara frog. Our findings emphasize the influence of past selection pressures on current perceptual mechanisms, and demonstrate how neural network models can be used to address behavioural questions that are intractable through traditional methods.},

abstract = {Aquaporins are transmembrane channels found in cell membranes of all life forms. We examine their apparently paradoxical property, facilitation of efficient permeation of water while excluding protons, which is of critical importance to preserving the electrochemical potential across the cell membrane. We have determined the structure of the Escherichia coli aquaglyceroporin GlpF with bound water, in native (2.7 angstroms) and in W48F/F200T mutant (2.1 angstroms) forms, and carried out 12-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations that define the spatial and temporal probability distribution and orientation of a single file of seven to nine water molecules inside the channel. Two conserved asparagines force a central water molecule to serve strictly as a hydrogen bond donor to its neighboring water molecules. Assisted by the electrostatic potential generated by two half-membrane spanning loops, this dictates opposite orientations of water molecules in the two halves of the channel, and thus prevents the formation of a "proton wire," while permitting rapid water diffusion. Both simulations and observations revealed a more regular distribution of channel water and an increased water permeability for the W48F/F200T mutant.},

However, our experiments suggest that the ants use ambient light levels within the nest cavity to assess the abundance of nest entrances rather than counting per se. Intriguingly, Weber's Law cannot explain the ants' inaccuracy. The ants also use a second metric, independent of light, to assess and discriminate against wide entrances. Thus, these ants use at least two metrics to evaluate one nest trait: the configuration of the portals to their potential homes.},

abstract = {Microscopic mechanisms operating at the mineral-aqueous interface control rates of growth and dissolution, isotope fractionation and trace element partitioning during crystal growth. Despite the importance of characterizing surface kinetic controls on isotopic partitioning, no self-consistent microscopic theory has yet been presented which can simultaneously model both mineral growth rate and isotopic composition. Using a kinetic theory for . AB or di-ionic crystal growth, we derive a model to predict precipitation rate and isotope fractionation as a function of growth solution oversaturation and solution stoichiometry and apply the theory to calcium isotope fractionation during calcite precipitation.Our model assimilates the current understanding of surface controlled isotope fractionation with kinetic theories of ion-by-ion mineral growth to predict isotopic partitioning during the growth of ionic crystals. This approach accounts for the effect of solution composition on microscopic mineral surface structure and composition, providing numerous testable hypotheses for growth of sparingly soluble . AB crystals such as calcite, namely:. (1)Both oversaturation and solution stoichiometry control growth rate and partitioning of isotopes during precipitation;(2)for growth driven primarily by step propagation, distinct expressions describe dislocation- and 2D nucleation-driven growth rates, while the expression for isotope fractionation is the same for both mechanisms;(3)mineral precipitation occurring via the formation of an amorphous precursor will generate isotope effects that are not compatible with ion-by-ion growth theory and may therefore be excluded from comparison; and,(4)the absolute kinetic limit of isotope fractionation may not be accessible at high oversaturation due to the formation of amorphous precursors.Using calcite as a model system, we derive expressions for growth rate and isotopic fractionation as a function of oversaturation and Ca2+:CO32- in solution. Increasing oversaturation increases mineral growth rate and drives isotope partitioning towards the kinetic limit, while increasing the concentration of Ca 2+ relative to CO32- at a given oversaturation tends to drive crystal growth towards isotopic equilibrium. These competing effects attenuate the magnitude of isotope fractionations observable in terrestrial environments. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Our approach to proxy validation and development is described, primarily from a modeler's point of view. The approach is based on complementary steps in understanding the inorganic chemistry, inorganic isotope fractionation, and biological controls that determine palaeo-tracer signals in organisms used in climate reconstructions. Integration of laboratory experiments, field and culture studies, theoretical considerations and numerical modelling holds the key to the method's success. We describe effects of life-processes in foraminifera on stable carbon, oxygen, and boron isotopes as well as Mg incorporation into foraminiferal calcite shells. Stable boron isotopes will be used to illustrate our approach. We show that a mechanism-based understanding is often required before primary climate signals can be extracted from the geologic record because the signals can be heavily overprinted by secondary, non-climate related phenomena. Moreover, for some of the proxies, fundamental knowledge on the thermodynamic, inorganic basis is still lacking. One example is stable boron isotopes, a palaeo-pH proxy, for which the boron isotope fractionation between the dissolved boron compounds in seawater was not precisely known until recently. Attempts to overcome such hurdles are described and implications of our work for palaeoceanographic reconstructions are discussed.},

abstract = {Stable isotopes and trace elements in foraminifera shells are important for determining the paleochemistry of the ocean, and Mg/Ca ratios and delta(18)O values in foraminifera have recently been used to determine simultaneously the temperature and salinity of past oceans. However, large variations between species and significant Mg intra-shell heterogeneity indicate a major role for biological factors in determining the Mg/Ca ratio in foraminifera. Our novel in vivo observations on the biomineralization process of perforate foraminifera show that their calcareous wall is composed of two different calcite types: a thin, high-Mg primary layer, and low-Mg layers that cover the primary layer on both sides. The data may suggest that two biomineralization pathways are employed in the formation of the different calcite types. A new conceptual framework is provided to explain part of the Mg heterogeneity in foraminiferal shells and the variable sensitivity of the Mg/Ca ratio to temperature in different species.},

abstract = {Nature is adept at controlling mineralisation processes to produce single crystals and polycrystalline and amorphous structures with remarkable morphologies and mechanical properties. Calcium carbonate is one of the most common biominerals, and as such has received considerable attention, both in terms of research into the processes used in vivo to control calcification, and application of identified strategies to control precipitation synthetically. After providing an initial description of the structure and properties of calcium carbonate, this review will examine the mechanisms used by organisms to influence calcium carbonate nucleation and growth and will then demonstrate how identified control strategies have been applied to synthetic systems. The emphasis of the review is on biomimetic engineering of calcium carbonate which is considered in three principal sections: control of crystal growth using soluble additives, crystal growth in confinement and calcium carbonate deposition on solid substrates.

abstract = {Neutral, uncharged binding sites for calcium ions are proposed for elastin and collagen. The sites utilize, particularly from a conformational viewpoint, the most striking feature of the amino acid composition, that is, the high glycine content. Glycines favor the formation of beta-turns and associated conformations that are known, from studies on ion-transporting antibiotics, to interact with cations. By analogy with certain antibiotics, which are uncharged polypeptides and depsipeptides that bind cations by coordination with neutral acyl oxygens, it is proposed that calcium-ion binding also utilizes uncharged coordinating groups, i.e., neutral sites, in the protein matrix. The protein matrix, which becomes positively charged by virtue of the bound calcium ions, attracts neutralizing phosphate and carbonate ions, which then allow further calcium ion binding. The driving force is, therefore, the affinity of calcium ions for the neutral nucleation sites. The charge neutralization theory of calcification suggests a fundamental role of organic anions, for example sulfated mucopolysaccharides, in regulating bone formation and in retardation of atherosclerosis. The proposed mechanism contains elements that tend to unify several theories on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {Genetic engineering of food is the science which involves deliberate modification of the genetic material of plants or animals. It is an old agricultural practice carded on by farmers since early historical times, but recently it has been improved by technology. Many foods consumed today are either genetically modified (GM) whole foods, or contain ingredients derived from gene modification technology. Billions of dollars in U.S. food exports are realized from sales of GM seeds and crops. Despite the potential benefits of genetic engineering of foods, the technology is surrounded by controversy. Critics of GM technology include consumer and health groups, grain importers from European Union (EU) countries, organic farmers, environmentalists, concerned scientists, ethicists, religious rights groups, food advocacy groups, some politicians and trade protectionists. Some of the specific fears expressed by opponents of GM technology include alteration in nutritional quality of foods, potential toxicity, possible antibiotic resistance from GM crops, potential allergenicity and carcinogenicity from consuming GM foods. In addition, some more general concerns include environmental pollution, unintentional gene transfer to wild plants, possible creation of new viruses and toxins, limited access to seeds due to patenting of GM food plants, threat to crop genetic diversity, religious, cultural and ethical concerns, as well as fear of the unknown. Supporters of GM technology include private industries, research scientists, some consumers, U.S. farmers and regulatory agencies. Benefits presented by proponents of GM technology include improvement in fruit and vegetable shelf-life and organoleptic quality, improved nutritional quality and health benefits in foods, improved protein and carbohydrate content of foods, improved fat quality, improved quality and quantity of meat, milk and livestock. Other potential benefits are: the use of GM livestock to grow organs for transplant into humans, increased crop yield, improvement in agriculture through breeding insect, pest, disease, and weather resistant crops and herbicide tolerant crops, use of GM plants as bio-factories to yield raw materials for industrial uses, use of GM organisms in drug manufacture, in recycling and/or removal of toxic industrial wastes. The potential risks and benefits of the new technology to man and the environment are reviewed. Ways of minimizing potential risks and maximizing the benefits of GM foods are suggested. Because the benefits of GM foods apparently far outweigh the risks, regulatory agencies and industries involved in GM food business should increase public awareness in this technology to enhance worldwide acceptability of GM foods. This can be achieved through openness, education, and research. (C) Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous algal species, Emiliania huxleyi, was incubated in sea water supplemented only with nitrate and phosphate (N and P) without chelating agents to control metal speciation. Growth was slow in a 'low-iron' culture containing 1.3 nM iron and was found to be iron-limited, growth-accelerating when a 1-nM iron addition was made. The growth rate in a 'high-iron' culture (5.4 nM iron) was greater, reaching 0.4 div day-1 but this culture too was found to have become iron-limited when a 9-nM iron addition was made on day 17 of the incubation. Both cultures were found to release iron-complexing ligands in excess of the iron concentration, 6 nM in the low-iron culture, and 10 nM in the high-iron culture. More ligands were produced after the iron addition taking the ligand concentration to 11 nM in the low-iron culture. The data show that the ligands are released in response to the iron addition, when at least some of the iron had already been taken up. This type of release is contrary to the concept of a siderophore, which is supposed to be released in periods of lack of iron; however the increase in the ligand concentration is similar to that released by the natural community in response to the iron addition in the IRON-EX II experiment [Rue, E.L., Bruland, K.W., 1997. The role of organic complexation on ambient iron chemistry in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the response of a mesoscale iron addition experiment. Limnol. Oceanogr. 42, 901-910]. The enhanced growth in the cultures when more iron was added indicated that the organically complexed iron present in the cultures was not immediately available to the organisms (or at least not at sufficiently high rate), and that the organisms responded to freshly added, inorganic, iron.

For phosphorus (P) almost all XANES measurements have been carried out at the K-edge. The small number of distinctive features at the P K-edge makes in some cases the identification of different P forms difficult or impossible. As indicated by a few previous studies, the P L(2,3)-edge spectra were richer in spectral features than those of the P K-edge. However, experimentally consistent spectra of a wide range of reference compounds have not been published so far. In this study a library of spectral features is presented for a number of mineral P, organic P and P-bearing minerals for fingerprinting identification. Furthermore, the effect of radiation damage is shown for three compounds and measures are proposed to reduce it. The spectra library provided lays a basis for the identification of individual P forms in samples of unknown composition for a variety of scientific areas.},

McElligott and Byrne [McElligott, S., Byrne, R.H., 1998. Interaction of B(OH)30 and HCO3- in seawater: Formation of B(OH)2 CO3-. Aquat. Geochem. 3, 345-356.] have also found B(OH)3 to form an aqueous complex with HCO3- 1. Recently Lemarchand et al. [Lemarchand, E., Schott, J., Gaillardeet, J., 2005. Boron isotopic fractionation related to boron sorption on humic acid and the structure of surface complexes formed. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 69, 3519-3533] have studied the formation of surface complexes of B(OH)3 on humic acid, determining 11B NMR shifts and fitted values of formation constants, and 11B, 10B isotope fractionations for a number of surface complexation models. Their work helps to clarify both the nature of the interaction of boric acid with the functional groups in humic acid and the nature of some of these coordinating sites on the humic acid. The determination of isotope fractionations may be seen as a form of vibrational spectroscopy, using the fractionating element as a local probe of the vibrational spectrum. We have calculated quantum mechanically the structures, stabilities, vibrational spectra, 11B NMR spectra and 11B,10B isotope fractionations of a number of complexes B(OH)2L- formed by reactions of the type:B (OH)3 + HL- ⇒ B (OH)2 L- + H2 Ousing a 6-311G(d,p) basis set and the B3LYP method for determination of structures, vibrational frequencies and isotopic fractionations, the highly accurate Complete Basis Set-QB3 method for calculating the free energies and the GIAO HF method with a 6-311+G(2d,p) basis for the NMR shieldings. The calculations indicate that oxalic acid, malonic acid, catechol and glycolic acid all form stable complexes ($\Delta$G {\textless} 0 for Reaction (1)),which are deshielded (less negative $\delta$) vs. the (C2H5)2OBF3 reference by 3.6, 1.5, 6.5 and 5.4 ppm, respectively, and which are isotopically lighter than B(OH)4- (more negative $\delta$ 11B) by 3‰, 2‰, 5‰ and 2‰, respectively. The calculated 11B NMR shifts match well literature values and with the results of Lemarchand et al. (2005), while the calculated isotopic fractionations are also consistent with their results, but show much smaller deviations from B(OH)4- t than indicated by these authors. This is a consequence of the use by Lemarchand et al. (2005) of a value of 1.0194 [Kakihana, H., Kotake, M., Satoh, S., Nomura, M., Okamoto, M., 1977. Fundamental studies on the ion-exchange separation of boron isotopes. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 50, 158-163.] for the 11B,10B isotopic exchange equilibrium constant of the B(OH)3, B(OH)4- pair which is obsolete and should be replaced by the new purely experimentally determined value of 1.0285 for 0.63 molar ionic strength [Byrne, R.H., Yao, W., Klochko, K., Kaufman, A.J., Tossell, J.A., 2006. Experimental evaluation of the isotopic exchange equilibrium 10 B(OH)3 + 11 B(OH)4- = 11 B(OH)3 + 10 B(OH)4-in aqueous solution. Deep-Sea Res. 1 (53), 684-688.] or 1.0308 for pure water [Klochko, K., Kaufman, A.J., Yao, W., Byrne, R.H., Tossell, J.A., 2006. Experimental measurement of boron isotope fractionation in seawater. Earth Planet Sci. Lett. 248, 276-285]. Given this correction the B(OH)2L- complexes are observed to be isotopically lighter than B(OH)4- by only a few ‰. Changes in 11B NMR shift and 11B,10B isotope fractionations for the B(OH)2L- complexes, compared to B(OH)4-, are found to be correlated to some extent with distortions of the O-B-O angles from tetrahedral values and/or with B-O bond strength sums. Similar free energies for the corner-sharing and 4-ring isomers of B(OH)2 CO3- suggest a mechanism for creation of both BIII and BIV environments when B is incorporated into calcite. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Marine microalgae (Emiliania huxleyi) were grown in seawater enriched only with nitrogen and phosphorus, without control of free metal concentrations using synthetic chelators. Complexing ligands and thiol compounds were determined by cathodic stripping volt-ammetry. Copper was added to these cultures, and ligands were produced in response to the copper addition. Parallel measurements of thiols showed that glutathione and other unidentified thiols (electrochemically similar to thioacetamide) were produced by the algae at rates and concentrations similar to those of the complexing ligands. Smaller amounts of thiols were produced when ligands including thiols were added to the culture. The results indicate that thiols can account for a major part or most of the copper-complexing ligands produced by these algae. Furthermore, a feedback mechanism exists in which the production of thiol-type complexing ligands is controlled by the free copper concentration, production already being stimulated by an increase of [Cu2+] from 0.4 to 1.5 pM. Incubations with added exudates, thiols, and salicylaldoxime (SA) showed much reduced copper toxicity even though copper uptake was increased by the exudates and the SA.},

abstract = {Cyanobacterial hepatotoxins, microcystins, are specific inhibitors of serine/threonine protein phosphatases and potent tumor promoters. They have caused several poisonings of animals and also pose a health hazard for humans through the use of water for drinking and recreation. Different strains of the same cyanobacterial species may variously be nontoxic, be neurotoxic, or produce several microcystin variants. It is poorly understood how the amount of toxins varies in a single strain. This laboratory study shows the importance of external growth stimuli in regulating the levels and relative proportions of different microcystin variants in two strains of filamentous, nitrogen-fixing Anabaena spp. The concentration of the toxins in the cells increased with phosphorus. High temperatures (25 to 30 degrees C), together with the highest levels of light studied (test range, 2 to 100 mumol m-2 s-1), decreased their amount. Different structural variants of microcystins responded differently to growth stimuli. Variants of microcystin (MCYST)-LR correlated with temperatures below 25 degrees C, and those of MCYST-RR correlated with higher temperatures. Nitrogen added into the growth medium and increasing temperatures increased the proportion of microcystin variants demethylated in amino acid 3. All variants remained mostly intracellular. Time was the most important factor causing the release of the toxins into the growth medium. Time, nitrogen added into the growth medium, and light fluxes above 25 mumol m-2 s-1 significantly increased the concentrations of the dissolved toxins. According to the results, it thus seems that the reduction of phosphorus loads in bodies of water might play a role in preventing the health hazards that toxic cyanobacterial water blooms pose, not only by decreasing the cyanobacteria but also by decreasing their toxin content.},

Because changes in deep water temperature may be small, sample preparation could play an important role in reconstructing accurate temperatures from shell Mg/Ca. A simple examination of changes in measured shell chemistry of benthic foraminifera from two intervals subjected to increasingly rigorous cleaning reveals that fossil benthic foraminiferal samples cleaned by oxidation yield lower Mg/Ca values than samples only rinsed and weak acid leached. Reductive cleaning further lowered the shell Mg/Ca of one of the two benthic species examined. Lower Mg/Ca values following oxidation and reduction appear to reflect removal of contaminant Mg associated with remnant organic matter and adsorbed phases.},

Depending on the type of polymeric functionalization pattern used, it was possible to grow two of the three different crystal modifications of CaCO3 (vaterite and calcite) under similar conditions. Vaterite could be successfully stabilized for more than 1 year by the polymer under conditions where it would normally transform into calcite within 80 h. Also the crystal size and shape respond to the polymeric template; for example, it was possible to grow monodisperse spherical particles with a diameter of ca. 2 ?m or hollow spheres both consisting of aggregated nanocrystallites. The effect of different functional groups and of variable block length on the size, shape, and morphology of CaCO3 is discussed. It must be emphasized that these particles sediment, but are stabilized and protected by a dense layer of double-hydrophilic block copolymers, which enables direct use as pigments and fillers or in ceramic processing.},

abstract = {There were three negative seawater strontium-isotope excursions (shifts to lower Sr-87/Sr-86 values) during the Jurassic and Cretaceous that were of relatively short duration (5-13 my) and showed a relatively quick recovery to pre-excursion Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. These excursions occurred in the Pliensbachian-Toarcian (Early Jurassic), Aptian-Albian, and Cenomanian-Santonian (Early and Late Cretaceous respectively). Each excursion coincided closely in time with an Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) marked by sediments unusually rich in organic carbon. The Jurassic OAE occurred at the end of the strontium-isotope excursion, whereas the two Cretaceous OAEs occurred at the onset of the accompanying strontium-isotope excursions. The possible causes of these excursions were evaluated by successively examining the changes in the riverine strontium fluxes, riverine Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, or hydrothermal strontium fluxes required to produce each excursion. A range of seawater strontium budgets was used to encompass the uncertainties in modern and ancient cycles. To produce the excursions, we calculate that the riverine strontium fluxes would have had to decrease by 6 to 15 percent or the fluvial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios by 0.00019 to 0.00046. The uncertainties largely stem from the assumed magnitude of the hydrothermal strontiun flux at the onset of each excursion. Alternatively, increases in sea-floor hydrothermal activity of 7 to 104 percent could also have produced the strontium-isotope excursions. This large range is due mostly to uncertainties in the relative flux of strontium from axial high-temperature hydrothermal systems and low-temperature off-axis systems. Only a small portion of this range stems from uncertainties in the riverine strontium terms. The possible causes of the excursions were further evaluated by examining several geologic factors that could have affected riverine strontium, including climate change, sealevel, and the eruption of flood basalts. We conclude that neither variations in riverine strontium fluxes nor in Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios is the likely cause of the strontium-isotope excursions. The most probable explanation is increased rates of hydrothermal activity related to increased ocean-crust production at the mid-ocean ridges. The close correlation in time between the strontium-isotope excursions and the major Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs) is compatible with a causal linkage. We propose that increased ocean-crust production led to enhanced COP outgassing and global warming, which in turn led to several processes that acted to make surface ocean waters more productive. However, because OAEs did not occur throughout the proposed periods of enhanced hydrothermal activity, it appears that these processes only preconditioned the oceans for the OAEs: sealevel rise may have been the final trigger. This model explains why all three OAEs did not occur at the same time relative to the onset of excess hydrothermal activity and why OAEs are not associated with every sealevel rise documented in the stratigraphic record.},

abstract = {Magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) ratios were measured in the deep-sea ostracod (Crustacea) genus Krithe from Chain core 82-24-4PC from the western mid-Atlantic Ridge (3427 m) in order to estimate ocean circulation and bottom water temperature (BWT) variability over the past 200,000 years. Mg/Ca ratios have been used as a paleothermometer because the ratios are controlled primarily by ambient water temperatures at the time the organism secretes its adult carapace. Over the past two glacial-interglacial cycles, Mg/Ca values oscillated between about 7 mmol/mol and 12 mmol/mol, equivalent to a BWT range of 0 to {\textgreater} 3.5??C. The lowest values were obtained on specimens from glacial marine isotope stages (MISs) 2, 4 and 6; the highest values were obtained from specimens from the early part of the Holocene interglacial (MIS 1), and also from MISs 5 and 7. These trends suggest that BWTs in the North Atlantic Ocean fluctuate over orbital time scales. Suborbital variability in Mg/Ca ratios and BWT was also observed for the past 100,000 years. Ratios rose from {\~{}}8 mmol/mol to {\~{}}10 mmol/mol (implying a BWT increase of {\~{}}1 to 3??C) during 14 Mg/Ca excursions. The highest ratios were found in Krithe dated at approximately 32, 36-38, 43, 48, 73, 85 and 93 ka. Although the age model for the Chain 82-24-4PC and temporal resolution do not allow precise correlation, some of these deep-sea bottom temperature excursions appear to correspond to Heinrich events recorded in other regions of the North Atlantic and perhaps Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadial events recorded in Greenland ice cores. If confirmed, this would support the hypothesis that millennial-scale oscillations of climate in the North Atlantic are capable of affecting global climate via thermohaline circulation changes.

abstract = {Measurements of velocity, density, and pressure gradient in the lower Hudson River estuary were used to quantify the dominant terms in the momentum equation and to characterize their variations at tidal and spring neap timescales. The vertical momentum flux (assumed to be due mainly to turbulent shear stress) was estimated indirectly, based on the residual from the acceleration and pressure gradient terms. The indirect estimates of stress compared favorably to bottom stress estimates using a quadratic drag law, supporting the hypothesis that the tidal momentum equation involves a local balance between tidal acceleration, pressure gradient, and stress divergence. Estimates of eddy viscosity indicated that there was significant tidal asymmetry, with flood tide values exceeding ebb values by a factor of 2. As a consequence of the asymmetry, the vertical structure of the tidally averaged stress bore no resemblance to the tidally averaged shear. In spite of the asymmetry of vertical mixing, the tidally averaged, estuarine circulation was found to depend simply on the intensity of bottom turbulence, which could be parameterized by a Rayleigh drag formulation based on the tidal velocity magnitude and the tidally averaged near-bottom flow. This seemingly paradoxical result indicates that the estuarine circulation can be modeled without detailed knowledge of the effective eddy viscosity, only requiring an estimate of the bottom drag coefficient, the tidal forcing conditions, and the baroclinic pressure gradient. A notable characteristic of this solution is an inverse dependence of the estuarine circulation on the amplitude of the tides.},

abstract = {Contemporaneous occurrences of the geologic signals of 'large impacts', craton-associated continental flood basalts, and mass extinctions have occurred far too often during the past 400 Myr to be plausibly attributed to random coincidence. While there is only a 1 in 8 chance that even one synchronous large impact within the interval of a continental flood basalt and mass extinction event should have happened during this period, there is now geologic evidence of four such 'coincidences', implying causal links between them. The ∼66 Ma (K-T) evidence suggests that impacts do not trigger flood basalts, since the Deccan flood basalt had started erupting well before the Chicxulub impact event. If extraterrestrial impacts do not trigger continental flood basalt volcanism, then we are really only left with two possible resolutions to the dilemma posed by these mega-coincidences: either the reported 'impact signals' at the times of great mass extinctions are spurious or misleading, or - somehow - a terrestrial process linked to continental rifting and the eruption of cratonic flood basalts is sometimes able to generate the shocked quartz, microspherules, and other geologic traces commonly attributed to large extraterrestrial impacts, while also triggering a mass extinction event. Here we explore a promising mechanistic link: a large explosive carbon-rich gas release event from cratonic lithosphere, triggered by mantle plume incubation beneath cratonic lithosphere, and typically associated with the onset phase of continental rifting. Sudden CO2/CO and SO2 release into the atmosphere would provide the primary killing mechanism of the induced extinction event. Such explosive deep- lithospheric blasts could create shock waves, cavitation, and mass jet formation within the venting region that could both create and transport a sufficiently large mass of shocked crust and mantle into globally dispersive super-stratospheric trajectories. We suggest these be called 'Verneshot' events. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Whereas these three species have similar Mg/Ca values at low sea surface temperatures (∼22°C), they diverge markedly at high sea surface temperatures (∼29°C). Explanations for these differences in species Mg/Ca values based on detailed comparison of species intratest Mg/Ca distributions suggest that compositional variability within tests cannot account for the observed deviation of species Mg/Ca values in warm-water equatorial regions. Multiple regression modeling and $\delta$18O analysis of Globigerinoides sacculifer tests indicate that interspecies differences in Mg/Ca values result from different depth habitats. The average Mg/Ca values of G. ruber final chambers reflect the temperature of the surface mixed layer (0–25 m), whereas those of G. sacculifer and Pulleniatina obliquiloculata correlate best with subsurface temperatures at 50–75 m and 100–125 m water depths, respectively. Mg/Ca calibration to the temperatures at these depths reveals a similar temperature control on Mg test composition in all species. Combining our results with Mg/Ca values from published culturing experiments, we derive a generalized equation for the effect of temperature and seawater salinity on foraminiferal Mg/Ca. We also show that the Mg/Ca composition of specific calcite layers within foraminiferal tests, including the low-Mg/Ca layers of Globigerinoides ruber and G. sacculifer and the cortex layer of Pulleniatina obliquiloculata, correlates with seawater temperature and can be used as an additional proxy for seawater temperature.},

abstract = {Macroalgae are a major component of many coral reef flat communities, and are potentially major competitors with corals. The influence of macroalgae on several demographic parameters of four species of scleractinian coral by means of an algal clearance experiment was examined to determine specifically if macroalgae are affecting coral cover, growth, fecundity, fission, survivorship and recruitment. Also investigated were patterns of natural encounters between corals and algae. Algal cover at the study site ranged from 41 to 56{\%}, and coral cover from 8 to 10{\%}. In total, 92 ± 4 (se){\%} of coral colonies were in contact with one or more species of macroalgae. Changes in coral cover were significantly affected by the presence of macroalgae, with cover of Acropora species increasing faster in areas from which algae had been cleared compared to control areas where algae had not been removed, although this pattern did not occur for Pocillopora damicornis (Linnaeus). Similarly, growth of individual colonies was faster when macroalgae were absent for three Acropora species but not for P. damicornis. There were no differences detected in rates of fission or survivorship of corals between algal clearance and control treatments, although there were high levels of variability in both of these parameters. Fecundity of Acropora palifera (Lamarck), the only species examined, was approximately double in colonies in cleared plots compared to those in control plots with macroalgae present. As no recruitment occurred throughout the 2-yr study, it remains to be determined how macroalgae effect the settlement of coral larvae. The results show that macroalgae can have a major influence on the demography of scleractinian corals.},

abstract = {A surface reaction kinetic model is developed for predicting Ca isotope fractionation and metal/Ca ratios of calcite as a function of rate of precipitation from aqueous solution. The model is based on the requirements for dynamic equilibrium; i.e. proximity to equilibrium conditions is determined by the ratio of the net precipitation rate (Rp) to the gross forward precipitation rate (Rf), for conditions where ionic transport to the growing crystal surface is not rate-limiting. The value of Rp has been experimentally measured under varying conditions, but the magnitude of Rf is not generally known, and may depend on several factors. It is posited that, for systems with no trace constituents that alter the surface chemistry, Rf can be estimated from the bulk far-from-equilibrium dissolution rate of calcite (Rb or kb), since at equilibrium Rf=Rb, and Rp=0. Hence it can be inferred that Rf???Rp+Rb. The dissolution rate of pure calcite is measureable and is known to be a function of temperature and pH. At given temperature and pH, equilibrium precipitation is approached when Rp (=Rf-Rb)???Rb. For precipitation rates high enough that Rp???Rb, both isotopic and trace element partitioning are controlled by the kinetics of ion attachment to the mineral surface, which tend to favor more rapid incorporation of the light isotopes of Ca and discriminate weakly between trace metals and Ca. With varying precipitation rate, a transition region between equilibrium and kinetic control occurs near Rp???Rb for Ca isotopic fractionation. According to this model, Ca isotopic data can be used to estimate Rf for calcite precipitation. Mechanistic models for calcite precipitation indicate that the molecular exchange rate is not constant at constant T and pH, but rather is dependent also on solution saturation state and hence Rp. Allowing Rb to vary as Rp1/2, consistent with available precipitation rate studies, produces a better fit to some trace element and isotopic data than a model where Rb is constant. This model can account for most of the experimental data in the literature on the dependence of 44Ca/40Ca and metal/Ca fractionation in calcite as a function of precipitation rate and temperature, and also accounts for 18O/16O variations with some assumptions. The apparent temperature dependence of Ca isotope fractionation in calcite may stem from the dependence of Rb on temperature; there should be analogous pH dependence at pH{\textless}6. The proposed model may be valuable for predicting the behavior of isotopic and trace element fractionation for a range of elements of interest in low-temperature aqueous geochemistry. The theory presented is based on measureable thermo-kinetic parameters in contrast to models that require hyper-fast diffusivity in near-surface layers of the solid. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Four species of foraminifera (G. ruber [white], G. sacculifer, N. dutertrei and P. obliquiloculata) from Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Ocean core-top samples were examined by CT and SEM. Inner chamber walls began to dissolve at increment[CO32-] values of 12-14$\mu$mol/kg. Close to the calcite saturation horizon, dissolution and precipitation of calcite may occur simultaneously. Inner calcite of G. sacculifer, N. dutertrei and P. obliquiloculata from such sites appeared altered or replaced, whereas outer crust calcite was dense with no pores. Unlike the other species, there was no distinction between inner and outer calcite in CT scans of G. ruber. Empty calcite crusts of N. dutertrei and P. obliquiloculata were most resistant to dissolution and were present in samples where increment[CO32-]≈20$\mu$mol/kg. Five stages of preservation were identified in CT scans, and an empirical dissolution index, XDX, was established. XDX appears to be insensitive to initial test mass.

Minor gaps in measurements exist only for the uppermost Brahmanian, lower part of the Upper Olenekian, and Middle Norian, and only sparse data are available for the Late Permian. These 219 measurements include 67 brachiopods and 114 conodont samples from the Tethyan realm as well as 37 brachiopods and one conodont sample from the mid-European Middle Triassic Muschelkalk Sea. The Late Permian/Lower Triassic interval is characterized by a steep 1. 10-3 rise, from 0.7070 at the base of the Dzhulfian to 0.7082 in the late Olenekian, a rate of change comparable to that in the Cenozoic. In the mid-Triassic (Anisian and Ladinian), the isotope values fall to 0.7075, followed again by a rise to 0.7081 in the Middle/Late Norian. The 87Sr/86Sr values decline again in the Late Norian (Sevatian) and Rhaetian to 0.7076. The sharp rise in the 87Sr/86Sr values during the Late Permian/Early Triassic was coincident with widespread clastic sedimentation. Because of the paucity of tectonic uplifts, the enhanced erosion may have been due to intermittent humid phases, during mainly an arid interval, coupled with the absence of a dense protective land plant cover following the mass extinction during the latest Permian. The apex of the 87Sr/86Sr curve at the Olenekian/Anisian boundary coincides with cessation of the large-scale clastic sedimentation and also marks the final recovery of land vegetation, as indicated by the renewed onset of coal formation in the Middle Triassic. The rising 87Sr/86Sr values from the Middle Carnian to the Late Norian coincide with the uplift and erosion of the Cimmeride-Indosinian orogens marking the closure of the Palaeotethys. The subsequent Rhaetian decline that continues into Jurassic (Pliensbachian/Toarcian boundary), on the other hand, coincides with the opening of the Vardar Ocean and its eastern continuation in the Izmir-Ankara Ophiolitic Belt. Samples from the Upper Muschelkalk are more radiogenic than the global trend. This may reflect separation of the basin from the open ocean. Due to strong meteoric influx from a large land mass in the north, the Germanic Basin became increasing brackish up section in the north and east, but because of the high evaporation rates, the salt content was not much reduced in the southern and central basin where a rich, but increasingly endemic, marine fauna survived. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Biomineralization is a widely dispersed and highly regulated but poorly understood process by which organisms precipitate minerals from a wide variety of elements [1]. For many years, it has been hypothesized that the biological precipitation of carbonates is catalyzed by and organized on an extracellular organic matrix containing a suite of proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides [2, 3]. The structures of these molecules, their evolutionary history, and the biophysical mechanisms responsible for calcification remain enigmatic. Despite the recognition that mineralized tissues contain proteins that are unusually rich in aspartic and glutamic acids [4-6], the role of these proteins in biomineralization remains elusive [5, 6]. Here we report, for the first time, the identification, cloning, amino acid sequence, and characterization of four highly acidic proteins, derived from expression of genes obtained from the common stony coral, Stylophora pistillata. Each of these four proteins can spontaneously catalyze the precipitation of calcium carbonate in vitro. Our results demonstrate that coral acid-rich proteins (CARPs) not only bind Ca 2+ stoichiometrically but also precipitate aragonite in vitro in seawater at pH 8.2 and 7.6, via an electrostatic interaction with protons on bicarbonate anions. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that at least one of the CARPs arose from a gene fusion. Similar, highly acidic proteins appear to have evolved several times independently in metazoans through convergence. Based purely on thermodynamic grounds, the predicted change in surface ocean pH in the next decades would appear to have minimal effect on the capacity of these acid-rich proteins to precipitate carbonates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A high-quality home can be a major factor determining fitness. However, when house hunting becomes necessary, animals might often face a speed-versus-accuracy trade-off and therefore be unable to survey their environment extensively for the optimum site. We found that the ant Leptothorax albipennis was able to correct errors made in such a hurried decision by continuing to survey even after a colony had settled in a nest site. Colonies moved from intact undisturbed nests to another nest site whenever the new nest site presented a sufficient improvement in nest quality. Thus, scout ants must be able to judge and compare the quality of the new, empty nest site with the one currently inhabited by the colony. Emigrations from intact nests were initiated by high numbers of ants recruited by tandem runs. This evidence may explain how a small number of scouts can motivate an entire colony to move when there is no immediate need to do so. Compared with their behaviour in emigrations from destroyed nests, the ants favoured even more strongly accuracy over speed, because they waited for a larger number of scouts to agree on one site before starting the emigration.

abstract = {Recent experiments have demonstrated the importance of numerical assessment in animal contests. Nevertheless, few attempts have been made to model explicitly the relationship between the relative number of combatants on each side and the costs and benefits of entering a contest. One framework that may be especially suitable for making such explicit predictions is Lanchester's theory of combat, which has proved useful for understanding combat strategies in humans and several species of ants. We show, with data from a recent series of playback experiments, that a model derived from Lanchester's 'square law' predicts willingness to enter intergroup contests in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Furthermore, the model predicts that, in contests with multiple individuals on each side, chimpanzees in this population should be willing to enter a contest only if they outnumber the opposing side by a factor of 1.5. We evaluate these results for intergroup encounters in chimpanzees and also discuss potential applications of Lanchester's square and linear laws for understanding combat strategies in other species.},

abstract = {Unialgal cultures of the widespread tremalith-bearing coccolithophorid Ochrosphaera neapolitana Schussnig were investigated using light and electron microscopy. O. neapolitana exhibits a heteromorphic life cycle identical to that described for the closely related tremalith-bearing genus Hymenomonas, involving an alternation between ( diploid) coccolith-bearing cells and a ( haploid) non-calcifying phase, characterised by the production of layers of mucilage. Differing scale ornamentation between the two phases together with chromosome counts confirms the diplo-haplontic nature of this cycle. The coccolith-bearing phase may be non-motile or possess flagella. The coccoliths of all strains studied exhibit the typical tremalith structure, but variation in size and shape is observed (vari-monomorphism). Unusual among coccolithophorids, the coccosphere of this species is not continually renewed, and progressive extracellular calcification of the coccoliths is observed in old cultures that may result in the formation of a calcareous 'pseudocyst'. At the ultrastructural level, the flagellar apparatus is of the Pleurochrysis type, consisting of two flagellar basal bodies linked by proximal, intermediary and distal bands, a vestigial haptonema consisting of five microtubules, and four asymmetrically arranged microtubular roots. Two roots are compound, each possessing a secondary crystalline microtubular component, and two are simple. The peripheral endoplasmic reticulum plays a role in coccolithogenesis, which occurs in the proximity of the plasma membrane. The taxonomy of the genus Ochrosphaera is discussed and suppression of the two other species in the genus, O. verrucosa Schussnig and O. rovignensis Schussnig, is suggested.},

abstract = {Accurate records of the state of the ocean carbonate system are critical for understanding past changes in pCO2, ocean acidification and climate. The chemical principles underlying the proxy of oceanic pH provided by the boron isotope ratio of foraminiferal carbonate are relatively well understood, but the proxy's reliability has been questioned. We present 76 new Multi-Collector Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) $\delta$11B measurements on a range of benthic foraminifera from 23 late-Holocene samples from the Atlantic that reaffirm the utility of the $\delta$11B-pH proxy. Our boron isotope measurements on {\~{}}10 benthic foraminifera tests typically yield a precision of {\~{}}±0.25‰ at 2 s.d. (equivalent to {\~{}}±0.03 pH units). $\delta$11B values of epifaunal species are within analytical uncertainty of those predicted from a simple model assuming sole incorporation of B(OH)4- from seawater and no vital effects, using the independently determined fractionation factor of 1.0272 between 11B/10B of aqueous boron species. Infaunal foraminifera are consistent with this model, but record the combined effects of lower pore-water $\delta$11B and pH. No influence of partial dissolution or shell size on $\delta$11B is observed. We have also measured the B/Ca ratios of the same samples. For individual Cibicidoides species, B/Ca shows a good correlation with $\delta$[CO32-], but the B/Ca of different co-occurring species morphotypes varies considerably. These effects are not seen in $\delta$11B, which may therefore provide a more robust proxy of the ocean carbonate system. Whilst in theory $\delta$11B and B/Ca can be combined to provide a quantitative reconstruction of alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbonate (DIC), in practice this is precluded by propagated uncertainties. $\delta$11B data give significant constraints on foraminifera calcification mechanisms, and seem most simply explained by incorporation of B(OH)4- into a HCO3- pool, which is then completely incorporated in foraminiferal CaCO3. Our demonstration of the predictable variation of $\delta$11B with pH, across a wide range of species and locations, provides confidence in the application of MC-ICPMS measurements of foraminiferal $\delta$11B to reconstruct past changes in the ocean carbonate system. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Veliger larvae of the European oyster taken seven days and 15 days after release from parent were anesthetized, fixed, critical-point dried, and examined with scanning electron microscopes. Study of body and shell in a growth series revealed many structures and patterns of development previously poorly known or unknown: (1) the presence of four ciliary bands on the velum, not three; (2) the heel-first development of the foot, with medial ciliation of the toe preceding complete ciliation; (3) the order of appearance and structure of major duct openings on the foot and body wall; (4) the beginning of larval eyes as hemispherical tufts of elongate microvilli; (5) the early development of gill primordia; and (6) the early appearance of a prominent gill bridge, which originates by cross-contact of cilia on the mantle margins followed by migration of epithelial cells and tissue fusion.A striking posterodorsal notch and growth track on the left valve of prodissoconch II of many Ostreidae and Gryphaeidae is formed by postanal cilia, which deform the fragile calcifying edge of the left valve but are unable to deform the more massive margin of the right valve.The transition from shell gland to mantle occurs very early in the prodissoconch-I stage, and increasing specialization of the mantle edge produces a three-layered shell well before the prodissoconch-I/II boundary, which merely marks the moment when the valves first completely enclose the body and close against one another. Shell microstructure does not change until metamorphosis, at which time the aragonitic microstructures disappear and are succeeded by far coarser calcitic structures. The postmetamorphic myostracum is an exception. It remains aragonitic and is possibly a continuation of the inner layer of the larval shell. The prodissoconch ligament is formed by periostracum, the fibrous resilium appearing later near the time of metamorphosis. The larval shells of oviparous and larviparous oysters differ, those of the former having a prodissoconch I that is smaller compared to prodissoconch II.},

abstract = {For paleoceanographic studies, it is important to understand the processes that influence the calcium (Ca) isotopic composition of foraminiferal calcite tests preserved in the sediment record. Seven species of planktonic foraminifera from coretop sediments collectively exhibited a Ca temperature dependent fractionation of 0.013??? per ??C. This is in agreement with previously published estimates for most species of planktonic foraminifera as well as biogenic and inorganic calcite and aragonite. Four species of planktonic foraminifera collected from a sediment trap showed a considerable amount of scatter and no consistent temperature dependent fractionation. Analyzed size fractions of coretop samples show no significant relationship with ??44/40Ca. However, preliminary results suggest that the symbiotic and spinose foraminifera Globigerinoides sacculifer might exhibit a relationship between test size and ??44/40Ca. A one-box model in which Ca isotopes are allowed to fractionate by Rayleigh distillation from a biomineralization reservoir (internal pool) was used to constrain the isotopic composition of the original biomineralization Ca reservoir, assuming around 85{\%} of the Ca reservoir is precipitated and the fractionation factor during precipitation is 0.9985 + 0.00002(T ??C). To explain the foraminiferal Ca isotope data, this model indicates that the Ca isotopic composition of the biomineralization reservoir is offset from seawater (approximately - 0.8???). ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Magnesium is considered the principal modifier of calcite morphology in many natural environments. However, the physical mechanism by which magnesium alters the external form of calcite has remained controversial due to a lack of direct experimental insight. Here we use in situ AFM observations of step dynamics and growth-hillock morphology to resolve the role of Mg (super 2+) in governing calcite surface morphologies. We show that Mg (super 2+) directly modifies the surface morphology of calcite as a consequence of differential interaction with four crystallographically controlled step directions. Step-specific interactions are especially evident at low Mg/Ca ratios in solution, where steps with acute step-edge geometries ([441]- and [481]-) are observed to be rough while obtuse steps ([441]+ and [481]+) remain smooth. Higher Mg/Ca solution ratios cause the edges of both step-types to become rough and the growth spiral to approach an elliptical form. During this process, new [421] step directions are generated by decreased growth velocities at the intersection of the + or - directions. As these steps flow along the [010] vector, they accumulate and result in the formation of pseudofacets with an orientation that approximates a (010) face. We propose that this phenomenon is the result of strain at the intersection of nonequivalent step-types, resulting in differential Mg (super 2+) incorporation across the boundary between those steps. This hypothesis is supported by estimates of the incorporated strain as well as observations of growth-hillock recovery from impurity poisoning that indicate the presence of "remembered" strain at the boundary of the nonequivalent step-types. The results of this study offer a plausible molecular-scale explanation for elongate calcite crystals that are commonly observed in sedimentary environments. This novel explanation for habit modification of calcite by impurities arises from step-specific impurity interactions rather than the face-specific interactions commonly assumed in previous models (Folk 1974; Lahann 1978).},

abstract = {The process of gametogenesis observed in six species of laboratory reared spinose planktonic foraminifera was accompanied by significant changes in the calcite test. All species resorbed their spines prior to gamete release. In addition, a calcite crust was subsequently secreted over the outside of the test in three of the species [Globigerinoides sacculifer (Brady),Globigerinoides conglobatus (Brady),Orbulina universa d'Orbigny], the test was decalcified in one species [Hastigerina pelagica (d'Orbigny)] and there was little or no calcite crust deposited on the test in two species [Globigerinella aequilateralis (Brady) andGlobigerinoides ruber d'Orbigny], although the test weights of at least one of these species (G. aequilateralis) were greater in gametogenic specimens. Gametogenic calcification resulted in greater test weight per unit length and slower dissolution rates in laboratory experiments for gametogenic specimens depositing a calcite crust compared with specimens that did not undergo gametogenic calcification. Based on our results, we conclude that the species composition of planktonic foraminiferal test assemblages in deep-sea sediments is affected by whether or not the species undergo gametogenic calcification or decalcification, and the proportion of these specimens that have attained reproductive maturity in the overlying waters. ?? 1990 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.},

abstract = {Some of the current studies of carbonic anhydrases are directed to the genetic mechanisms underlying their synthesis. Determination of the structure of their genes will probably most readily resolve the question of whether the membrane bound forms of the enzyme represent products of additional loci other than those of the three well-known soluble forms. Extensions of our knowledge of the sequences of these isozymes as well as those from lower animals and from plants will make possible a more precise evaluation of the extent of the multigene aspects of these proteins and their evolutionary backgrounds. Studies of the interrelationships of the regulation of the transcriptional and translational processes of the well-known isozymes and in particular the effects of hormones will be of interest. Insights into modifications of the isozymes' synthetic processes occurring in various diseases should also be forth-coming from these studies. In addition to the above the applications of what are perhaps today somewhat classical methods of protein chemistry will be needed to explore the reasons for the changes in activity accompanying the sequence variations of the different isozymes, the decreases or increases in activity accompanying derivatizations of specific residues and the reasons for the differences in the activity of different inhibitors on the various isozymes. The broad specificity of these enzymes for different substrates and the ability of CA-III to hydrolyze various phenyl esters and in some cases to become derivatized also present problems in protein structural chemistry. In terms of the latter reactions, the meaning of the relationships of these activities to those of the protein ubiquitin, which is homologous to CA-III, needs clarification. It would appear that various of the protein structural studies will be aided by crystallographic investigations of not only CA-III but of various of its derivatives which undergo either increases or decreases in activity. The above areas of studies present a wide variety of problems for workers in various disciplines and backgrounds who are interested in the carbonic anhydrases.},

The oxic surface layer of the sea bed varies in thickness from a few millimetres in sheltered coastal areas to 1 m in pelagic sediments1,2. Below this layer, organic matter is mineralized mainly by fermenting, denitrifying, sulphate-reducing and methane-producing bacteria. Sulphate reduction is the predominant terminal step in the mineralization processes of sulphate-rich shelf sediments where the sulphate reducers inhibit the methanogens by competing with them for common substrates3−5. Sulphate reduction may therefore have a quantitatively important role in the overall oxidation of organic matter in the sea bed. Recently, concurrent measurements of oxygen uptake and sulphate reduction in a coastal sediment6 have demonstrated the importance of the sulphate-reducing bacteria in the mineralization of organic carbon. I present here the first comparative survey of aerobic and anaerobic mineralization in the sea bed based on direct rate measurements of the two processes. The results demonstrate a surprisingly high contribution from the sulphate-reducers. In coastal sediments, this specialized group of bacteria oxidized as much organic matter to CO2 as did all the aerobic organisms. Their relative contribution decreased three fold over the continental shelf from the shore to a depth of 200 m.},

abstract = {A serious limitation of the field ion microscope has been its inability to identify the chemical nature of the individually imaged atoms. The newly conceived atom‐probe FIM is a combination probe‐hole FIM and mass spectrometer having single particle sensitivity. During observation, the observer selects an atomic site of interest by placing it over a probe hole in the image screen. Pulsed field evaporation sends the chosen particle through the hole and into the spectrometer section. Preliminary results show that field evaporation of tungsten under poor vacuum conditions occurs as triply or quadruply charged WO, WN, WO2, and WN2 ions, while under better conditions doubly and possibly triply charged tungsten can be observed. Mo–Re alloys always produced doubly charged molybdenum and rhenium ions when examined in the atom‐probe. Wide applications for the study of short range order in alloys, the chemical nature of precipitates and impurity atoms, and information regarding the imaging properties of various atom species, of both the substrate and adsorbed material, are foreseen.},

With increasing [CO2], a decrease in the particulate inorganic carbon to particulate organic carbon (PIC/POC) ratio was observed at all light intensities and L/D cycles tested. The individual response in cellular PIC and POC to [CO2] depended strongly on the PFD. POC production increased with rising [CO2], irrespective of the light intensity, and PIC production decreased with increasing [CO2] at a PFD of 150 ??mol m-2 s-1, whereas below this light level it was unaffected by [CO2]. Cell growth rate decreased with decreasing PFD, but was largely independent of ambient [CO2]. The diurnal variation in PIC and POC content, monitored over a 38-h period (16/8 h L/D, PFD = 150 ??mol m-2 s-1), exceeded the difference in carbon content between cells grown at high (??? 29 ??mol -1) and low (??? 4 ??mol -1) [CO2]. However, consistent with the results described above, cellular POC content was higher and PIC content lower at high [CO2], compared to the values at low [CO2], and the offset was observed throughout the day. It is suggested that the observed sensitivity of POC production for ambient [CO2] may be of importance in regulating species-specific primary production and species composition. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The heats of solution of the crystalline alkali halides are then used to show that only oppositely charged ions of equal water affinity spontaneously form inner sphere ion pairs, and that this controls ion binding to proteins. The net charge on a protein is a major determinant of its solubility. Finally, the surface potential difference and surface tension at an air-salt solution interface are used to generate a simple model for how ions affect protein stability and solubility through indirect interactions at the protein-solution interface.

abstract = {The Mg/Ca ratio of seawater has changed significantly over the Phanerozoic, primarily as a function of the rate of ocean-crust production. Echinoids, crabs, shrimps, and calcareous serpulid worms grown in artificial seawaters encompassing the range of Mg/Ca ratios that existed throughout the Phanerozoic exhibit a direct nonlinear relationship between skeletal and ambient Mg/Ca. Specimens grown in seawater with the lowest Mg/Ca ({\^{a}}ˆ¼1) changed their mineralogy to low-Mg calcite ({\textless}4 mol{\%} MgCO), suggesting that these high-Mg calcareous organisms would have produced low-Mg calcite in the Cretaceous, when oceanic Mg/Ca was lowest ({\^{a}}ˆ¼1). These results support the empirical evidence that the skeletal chemistry of calcareous organisms has varied significantly over the Phanerozoic as a function of the Mg/Ca of seawater, and that the Mg/Ca of unaltered fossils of such organisms may be a record of oceanic Mg/Ca throughout the Phanerozoic. Mg fractionation algorithms, which relate skeletal Mg/Ca, seawater Mg/Ca, and temperature, were derived from these and other experiments. They can be used to estimate paleoceanic Mg/ Ca ratios and temperatures from fossil skeletal Mg/Ca of the organisms evaluated. Pale oceanic Mg/Ca ratios, recalculated by using the echinoderm Mg fractionation algorithm from published fossil echinoid Mg/Ca, crinoid Mg/Ca, and paleotemperature data, are consistent with other estimates and models of oceanic Mg/Ca over the Phanerozoic.},

abstract = {Details of ostracode carapace structures were examined by SEM and TEM. The podo-copine ostracode Semicytherura kazahana has major ridges on the carapace surface and develops its prismatic layer inside the adult carapace. Electron microscopy at the final molt reveals that the major ridges arise from the highly dense formation of pits within the underlying swollen epidermis, and that disappearance of the epidermis in the presumptive area of the prismatic layer occurs after the calcification of the outer lamella cuticle, and just before synthesis of the membranous layer. These facts suggest that the formation of the carapace in Semicytherura takes place via a more complex process than that of the other podocopid ostracodes. {\&} Carapace, carapace formation, Crustacea, cuticle, epidermis, Ostracoda, prismatic layer, Semicytherura, SEM, TEM. Podocopid ostracodes have a large number of characters for their small body size, which is mostly less than 1 mm in carapace length. The carapace especially, which comprises the calcified cuticular layer and covers the whole body, is well preserved in fossils. Therefore, ostracodes are generally regarded as highly suitable material in order to understand their evolution by tracing their morphological changes through geological time. Most studies of the carapace have so far focused on the structure of the calcified cuticle (i.e. outer lamella cuticle) where it is necessary to understand the relationship between the cuticular layer and the underlying epidermis in order to eluci-date its formation and function. But to date there are only a small number of studies on carapace structure, including the soft tissues (e.g. membranous layer, underlying epidermis). Turpen {\&} Angell (1971) carried out experiments on the ostracode carapace involving Ca 45 as a tracer. Using a freshwater species of Heterocypris they showed that Ca is neither reabsorbed from the old carapace prior to molting nor stored for molting at the last molt stage. In addition, they reported that the amoeboid cells in the outer lamella move from the margin to the mid-region of the carapace during calcification, and then elaborate the calcite portion of the exo-skeleton. Rosenfeld (1979, 1982) observed granules in the epidermal layer of the carapace using SEM and TEM, and subsequently analyzed the granules using X-rays in the three freshwater species Cypris pubera M{\"{u}}ller, 1776, Eucypris virens (Juline, 1820) and E. lutaria (Koch, 1838). He reported that the granules mostly consist of Ca and serve as the material for calcification of the carapace. The relationship between the cuticular layer and the epidermis was well des-cribed in a series of studies by Okada (1981, 1982a, 1982b). He described the carapace ultrastructure in Bicornucythere bisanensis (Okubo, 1975) by SEM and TEM, and classified the molt into three stages, i.e. C, D and A, following on from the studies on the crustacean cuticle by Drach (1939, 1944) and Passano (1960) (the molt stage B could not be distinguished in B. bisanensis). Stage D was subdivided into four sub-stages with reference to studies of insect cuticles by Locke (1966). The relationship between carapace ornamentation and the underlying epidermis was clarified by determining the degree of development of the cuticle at the various molt stages. Okada's works demonstrated that the polygonal fossae (reticulations) on the carapace surface represented the arrangement of outer epidermal cells, and the development of them, during ontogeny, and are controlled by the mitoses of the outer epidermal cells (according to their geno-type). Keyser (1982) carried out SEM and TEM observations of the ontogenetic development of the sieve-type pore system in Hirschmannia viridis (M{\"{u}}ller, 1785), and discussed its function and mor-phogenesis. Keyser (1990) described the superficial phases of the epidermis at molting in Cyprideis torosa (Jones, 1850). Furthermore, Keyser (1995) discussed the general forming of cuticle in Cyprideis, Lepto-cythere and Heterocypris.},

abstract = {In order to study Strontium (Sr) partitioning and isotope fractionation of Sr and Calcium (Ca) in aragonite we performed precipitation experiments decoupling temperature and precipitation rates (R∗, $\mu$mol/m2 h) in the interval of about 2.3–4.5 $\mu$mol/m2 h. Aragonite is the only pure solid phase precipitated from a stirred solutions exposed to an atmosphere of NH3 and CO2 gases throughout the spontaneous decomposition of (NH4)2CO3. The order of reaction with respect to Ca ions is one and independent of temperature. However, the order of reaction with respect to the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is temperature dependent and decreases from three via two to one as temperature increases from 12.5 and 25.0 to 37.5 °C, respectively. Strontium distribution coefficient (DSr) increases with decreasing temperature. However, R∗ responds differently depending on the initial Sr/Ca concentration and temperature: at 37.5 °C DSr increase as a function of increasing R∗ but decrease for 12.5 and 25 °C. Not seen at 12.5 and 37.5 °C but at 25 °C the DSr-R∗ gradient is also changing sign depending on the initial Sr/Ca ratio. Magnesium (Mg) adsorption coefficient between aragonite and aqueous solution (DMg) decreases with temperature but increases with R∗ in the range of 2.4–3.8 $\mu$mol/m2 h. Strontium isotope fractionation ($\Delta$88/86Sraragonite-aq) follows the kinetic type of fractionation and become increasingly negative as a function of R∗ for all temperatures. In contrast Ca isotope fractionation ($\Delta$44/40Caaragonite-aq) shows a different behavior than the Sr isotopes. At low temperatures (12.5 and 25 °C) Ca isotope fractionation ($\Delta$44/40Caaragonite-aq) becomes positive as a function of R∗. In contrast, at 37.5 °C and as a function of increasing R∗ the $\Delta$44/40Caaragonite-aq show a Sr type like behavior and becomes increasingly negative. Concerning both the discrepant behavior of DSr as a function of temperature as well as for the Ca isotope fractionation as a function of temperature we infer that the switch of sign in the trace element partitioning as well as in the direction of the Ca isotope fractionation is probably due to the switch of complexation from a Ca2+-NH3 complexation at and below 25 °C to an Ca2+-H2O aquacomplex at 37.5 °C. The DSr–$\Delta$88/86Srcalcite-aq correlation for calcite is independent of temperature in contrast to aragonite. We interpreted the strong DSr-temperature dependency of aragonite, the smaller range of Sr isotope fractionation as well as the shallower $\Delta$88/86Srcalcite-aq–R∗ gradients to be a consequence of the increased aragonite solubility and the “Mg blocking effect”. In contrast to Sr the Ca isotope fractionation values in calcite and aragonite depend both on the complexation in solution and independent on polymorphism.},

In FW animals, sodium, chloride and urea were 208??3, 203??3 and 192??2 mmol l-1, respectively. Plasma sodium, chloride and urea in SW-captured C. leucas were 289??3, 296??6 and 370??10 mmol l-1, respectively. The increase in plasma osmolarity between FW and SW was not linear. Between FW (3 mosM) and 24??? SW (676 mosM), plasma osmolarity increased by 22{\%} or 0.92{\%} per 1??? rise in salinity. Between 24??? and 33???, plasma osmolarity increased by 33{\%} or 4.7{\%} per 1??? rise in salinity, largely due to a sharp increase in plasma urea between 28??? and 33???. C. leucas moving between FW and SW appear to be faced with three major osmoregulatory challenges, these occur between 0-10???, 11-20??? and 21-33???.

Atomic force microscopy was used to resolve the mechanism of calcite inhibition by magnesium through molecular-scale determination of the thermodynamic and kinetic controls of magnesium on calcite formation. Comparison of directly measured step velocities to standard impurity models demonstrated that enhanced mineral solubility through magnesium incorporation inhibited calcite growth. Terrace width measurements on calcite growth spirals were consistent with a decrease in effective supersaturation due to magnesium incorporation. Ca(1-x)Mg(x)CO3 solubilities determined from microscopic observations of step dynamics can thus be linked to macroscopic measurements.},

abstract = {Baron Justis Von Liebig (1803-1873), the founder of modern organic chemistry, is also recognized as the father of agricultural chemistry. He was the first to determine the exact elements taken up by plants from the air and soil, and this enabled him to develop efficient fertilizers. He raised the fundamental operations of agriculture to the level of an exact science (Moulton, 1942). With this knowledge, Liebig was the first to realize that the "... growth of a plant is dependent on the amount of food stuff which is presented to it in minimum quantity." This has become known in ecological circles as Liebig's Law of the Minimum. Absence of fixed N is usually thought to be the factor limiting plant growth in the ocean as exemplified by the large oligotrophic gyres where little, if any, nitrate is present. However, in other large ocean areas, such as the Gulf of Alaska, the equatorial Pacific, and the southern ocean, NO sub(3) and other major plant nutrients are readily available. Clearly, factors other than major nutrient deficiency limit phytoplankton growth in these regions. However, what these factors are remains a subject of debate to this day. (DBO)},

abstract = {Metal L2,3, sulfur K and oxygen K near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra for chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite, covellite, pyrrhotite and pyrite have been determined from single-piece natural mineral specimens in order to assess claims that chalcopyrite should be regarded as CuIIFeIIS2 rather than CuIFeIIIS2, and that copper oxide species are the principal initial oxidation products on chalcopyrite and bornite exposed to air. Spectra were obtained using both fluorescence and electron yields to obtain information representative of the bulk as well as the surface. Where appropriate, NEXAFS spectra have been interpreted by comparison with the densities of unfilled states and simulated spectra derived from ab initio calculations using primarily the FEFF8 code and to a lesser extent WIEN2k. Metal 2p and S 2p photoelectron spectra excited by monochromatised Al K?? X-rays were determined for each of the surfaces characterised by NEXAFS spectroscopy. The X-ray excited Cu LMM Auger spectrum was also determined for each copper-containing sulfide. FEFF8 calculations were able to simulate the experimental NEXAFS spectra quite well in most cases. For covellite and chalcocite, it was found that FEFF8 did not provide a good simulation of the Cu L3-edge spectra, but WIEN2k simulations were in close agreement with the experimental spectra. Largely on the basis of these simulations, it was concluded that there was no convincing evidence for chalcopyrite to be represented as CuIIFeIIS2, and no strong argument for some of the Cu in either bornite or covellite to be regarded as Cu(II). The ab initio calculations for chalcopyrite and bornite indicated that the density of Cu d-states immediately above the Fermi level was sufficient to account for the Cu L3-edge absorption spectrum, however these incompletely filled Cu d-states should not be interpreted as indicating some Cu(II) in the sulfide structure. It was also concluded that the X-ray absorption spectra were quite consistent with the initial oxidation products on chalcopyrite and bornite surfaces being iron oxide species, and inconsistent with the concomitant formation of copper-oxygen species. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Coccolithophores are exposed to solar UV radiation (UVR, 280-400 nm) in their natural habitats. However, little has been documented on their physiological responses to UVR. We investigated the UV impacts on the photosynthesis, calcification, photochemical efficiency and growth of Emiliania huxleyi while culturing the cells under solar radiation. Presence of UVR significantly decreased the rates of photosynthesis and calcification. Shorter wavelengths of UV-B led to more damages to photosynthetic apparatus than to calcifying machinery, while longer wavelengths of UV-A resulted more harms to the calcification. As the cells were grown during long-term exposures to solar radiation, the ratios of repair to UV-related damage increased, indicating their acclimation to UV. The specific growth rate of the acclimated cells was inhibited by natural levels of UVR by about 25{\%}, and the cells became bigger with more coccoliths, reflecting a slower cell division and enhanced calcification per cell, a trade off to counteract the UV-induced harms. The absorptivity of UV-absorbing compounds (peaked at 280 nm) increased tremendously in response to the exposure of UVR. UV-induced stress led to a protective strategy of E. huxleyi, sacrificing the growth by allocating energy for accumulation of these compounds and calcification. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper we summarise the photo-physiological responses of phytoplankton to upwelling of macronutrients in mesoscale eddies in the subtropical North Atlantic (EDDIES project, Sargasso Sea) and subtropical North Pacific (E-FLUX project, Hawaii). The observations, obtained on two sets of cruises over 2 years, occupied six cyclonic eddies and two mode-water eddies. The photosynthetic physiological parameters were measured using a bench-top fluorescence induction and relaxation (FIRe) system and a submersible in situ fast repetition rate fluorometer (FRRF) deployed on an undulating towed vehicle. Both of these instruments were used to provide highly sensitive and well-resolved data on community responses. The responses are dependent on both the type of eddy and its stage of development. Our results indicate that, while cyclonic eddies in the Atlantic and Pacific can increase primary photosynthetic production early in their development, mode-water eddies in the subtropical North Atlantic can support patchy blooms of large diatoms for long periods of time (more than 3 months). ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Marine nematode worms without a mouth or functional gut are found worldwide in intertidal sandflats, deep-sea muds and methane-rich pock marks, and morphological studies show that they are associated with endosymbiotic bacteria. While it has been hypothesized that the symbionts are chemoautotrophic sulfur oxidizers, to date nothing is known about the phylogeny or function of endosymbionts from marine nematodes. In this study, we characterized the association between bacterial endosymbionts and the marine nematode Astomonema sp. from coral reef sediments in the Bahamas. Phylogenetic analysis of the host based on its 18S rRNA gene showed that Astomonema sp. is most closely related to non-symbiotic nematodes of the families Linhomoeidae and Axonolaimidae and is not closely related to marine stilbonematinid nematodes with ectosymbiotic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. In contrast, phylogenetic analyses of the symbionts of Astomonema sp. using comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that these are closely related to the stilbonematinid ectosymbionts (95-96{\%} sequence similarity) as well as to the sulfur-oxidizing endosymbionts from gutless marine oligochaetes. The closest free-living relatives of these gammaproteobacterial symbionts are sulfur-oxidizing bacteria from the family Chromatiaceae. Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the bacterial symbionts completely fill the gut lumen of Astomonema sp., suggesting that these are their main source of nutrition. The close phylogenetic relationship of the Astomonema sp. symbionts to known sulfur-oxidizing bacteria as well as the presence of the aprA gene, typically found in sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, indicates that the Astomonema sp. symbionts use reduced sulfur compounds as an energy source to provide their hosts with nutrition.},

abstract = {We present the implementation and results of a model tuning and ensemble forecasting experiment using an ensemble Kalman filter for the simultaneous estimation of 12 parameters in a low resolution coupled atmosphere-ocean Earth System Model by tuning it to realistic data sets consisting of Levitus ocean temperature/salinity climatology, and NCEP/NCAR atmospheric temperature/humidity reanalysis data. The resulting ensemble of tuned model states is validated by comparing various diagnostics, such as mass and heat transports, to observational estimates and other model results. We show that this ensemble has a very reasonable climatology, with the 3-D ocean in particular having comparable realism to much more expensive coupled numerical models, at least in respect of these averaged indicators. A simple global warming experiment is performed to investigate the response and predictability of the climate to a change in radiative forcing, due to 100 years of 1{\%} per annum atmospheric CO2 increase. The equilibrium surface air temperature rise for this CO2 increase is 4.2 +/- 0.1degreesC, which is approached on a time scale of 1,000 years. The simple atmosphere in this version of the model is missing several factors which, if included, would substantially increase the uncertainty of this estimate. However. even within this ensemble, there is substantial regional variability due to the possibility of collapse of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC), which switches off in more than one third of the ensemble members. For these cases. the regional temperature is not only 3-5degrees colder than in he warmed worlds where the THC remains switched on. but is also 1-2degreesC colder than the current climate. Our results. which illustrate how objective probabilistic projections of future climate change can be efficiently generated, indicate a substantial uncertainty in the long-term future of the THC, and therefore the regional climate of western Europe. However. this uncertainty is only apparent in long-term integrations. with the initial transient response being similar across the entire ensemble. Application of this ensemble Kalman filtering technique to more complete climate models would improve the objectivity of probabilistic forecasts and hence should lead to significantly increased understanding of the uncertainty of our future climate.},

The shells show Sr and Ba fluctuations in regular annual patterns. Seasonal Sr decreases associated with the winter dormant period in Mercenaria, and with the summer growth decrease in Spisula indicate that kinetic control (growth rate) plays a more important role than temperature in the incorporation of this element. Barium exhibits sharp increases that are likely linked to periods of intense phytoplankton productivity.

Questions concerning the pace and impacts of climate change are thus central to many ecological and biogeochemical studies, and addressing the consequences of climate change is now high on the list of priorities for funding agencies. Here, we review the interactions between climate change and plankton communities, focusing on systematic changes in plankton community structure, abundance, distribution and phenology over recent decades. We examine the potential socioeconomic impacts of these plankton changes, such as the effects of bottom-up forcing on commercially exploited fish stocks (i.e. plankton as food for fish). We also consider the crucial roles that plankton might have in dictating the future pace of climate change via feedback mechanisms responding to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels. An important message emerges from this review: ongoing plankton monitoring programmes worldwide will act as sentinels to identify future changes in marine ecosystems. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Ab initio quantum chemistry calculations have been performed on the isotopic exchange reaction between B(OH)3 and B(OH)M4-. Several calculation methods have been carefully compared and evaluated. The "water-droplet" method is chosen to investigate this isotope exchange reaction using cluster models with up to 34 water molecules surrounding the solute. HF/6-31G* level calculations coupled with a 0.920 scaling factor are used for the frequency calculations. A larger K value (1.027) is obtained from this study compared to the commonly used 1.0194 (Kakihana et al., 1977). The fractionations for several boric acid polymers and boron minerals are also studied. Our results suggest that assuming the BO4 bonding in B(OH)4- is identical to that in borosilicates is wrong. Tetrahedral boron in silicates has a significantly smaller reduced isotopic partition function ratio (RPFR) and hence will be much isotopically lighter than in B(OH)4-. The new theoretical curve of pH vs. $\delta$11B composition of B(OH)4- using our calculated 1.027 can be used to predict pH values for equilibrium cases such as incorporation into inorganic calcite. We also find that the shape of this curve is very sensitive to both K and pKa value, giving the possibility of also predicting salinity from the different shapes of the curve.

Cells fixed in the presence of the polyanion-precipitating agent cetylpyridiniumchloride showed a voluminous coat over the crystalline matter of the coccolith giving the extracellular coccoliths the appearance of being glued together. Soluble acid polysaccharides are thought to occur in the coat. Evidence is presented that the coat and the crystalline matter are produced simultaneously. The excellent stainability of the Golgi apparatus allowed study of its morphology in considerable detail, and permitted a tentative reconstruction of the formation of coccoliths and scales and of the Golgi dynamics in general.

abstract = {Coprecipitation of radionuclides with secondary solids is currently neglected in safety assessments for radioactive waste repositories, although this process is thought to be important in limiting radionuclide solution concentrations. This paper provides a systematic review of laboratory data on metal coprecipitation with calcite, presented in the form of phenomenological partition coefficients. The aim of this investigation is to provide a consistent set of parameter values for the quantitative modelling of radionuclide coprecipitation with calcite, which will be the dominant alteration product in cementitious repositories accessed by carbonate-rich groundwater. From the data reviewed, empirical correlations have been derived that relate experimentally determined partition coefficients (??(Me)) to measurable chemical properties of the coprecipitated metals (ionic radii and sorption parameters of the incorporated trace metals, solubility products of the pure metal carbonates). These correlations have then been used to predict the partition coefficients of radionuclides for which no laboratory data exist. Such predictions indicate that the actinides will partition strongly into calcite under reducing conditions (??(Me) {\~{}}200-1000 for trivalent, ??(Me) {\~{}}20-200 for tetravalent actinides). Nickel(II) incorporation will be moderate (??(Me) {\~{}}110), while incorporation of ions like U(VI), Cs(I), Sr(II) and Ra(II) in calcite will be weak (??(Me) {\textless} 1). In spite of substantial uncertainties, the estimated partition coefficients are sufficiently accurate to allow a semi-quantitative evaluation of the effect of radionuclide coprecipitation with calcite in limiting radionuclide solution concentrations in well characterised repository environments.},

abstract = {Recent experimental evidence and computer modeling have shown that the crystallization of a range of minerals does not necessarily follow classical models and theories. In several systems, liquid precursors, stable pre-nucleation clusters and amorphous phases precede the nucleation and growth of stable mineral phases. However, little is known on the effect of background ionic species on the formation and stability of pre-nucleation species formed in aqueous solutions. Here, we present a systematic study on the effect of a range of background ions on the crystallization of solid phases in the CaCO3-H2O system, which has been thoroughly studied due to its technical and mineralogical importance, and is known to undergo non-classical crystallization pathways. The induction time for the onset of calcium carbonate nucleation and effective critical supersaturation are systematically higher in the presence of background ions with decreasing ionic radii. We propose that the stabilization of water molecules in the pre-nucleation clusters by background ions can explain these results. The stabilization of solvation water hinders cluster dehydration, which is an essential step for precipitation. This hypothesis is corroborated by the observed correlation between parameters such as the macroscopic equilibrium constant for the formation of calcium/carbonate ion associates, the induction time, and the ionic radius of the background ions in the solution. Overall, these results provide new evidence supporting the hypothesis that pre-nucleation cluster dehydration is the rate-controlling step for calcium carbonate precipitation.},

abstract = {We examined the response of diatoms to naturally experienced temperatures and tested these hypotheses: (1) diatoms follow the rule that organism size decreases with increasing temperature; (2) diatom growth rate follows a Q1O-like response; (3) diatom carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content per unit volume (V) decrease with increasing size, and changes in temperature affect this relationship; and (4) diatom C: V is the same as that of other phyto- plankton. We also present, as predictive equations, relationships between (1) growth rate, temperature, and size; (2) C content and V; and (3) N content and V. Eight diatoms and two flagellates were acclimated for approximately five generations and grown for approximately five more generations at five temperatures (9-25°C) on a 14: 10 light: dark cycle at 50 ,umol photons m-2 s-l. Growth rate, cell V, and C and N content per cell were measured; relationships between these parameters and temperature were determined. For five diatoms and both flagellates, cell V decreased with increasing temperature; cells decrease by 4{\%} of their mean V per °C. Growth rate appeared to increase linearly with temperature in all cases. The literature suggests that a linear response is the rule, not the exception. Temperature did not significantly affect C or N per V of diatom species. When all diatoms were con- sidered, both C and N per V decreased with increasing cell size; our data support the argument that diatoms differ from other protists in this respect, but the difference is less pronounced than stated in previous reports.},

abstract = {Nanocrystalline biological apatites constitute the mineral phase of vertebrate bone and teeth. Beyond their central importance to the mechanical function of our skeleton, their extraordinarily large surface acts as the most important ion exchanger for essential and toxic ions in our body. However, the nanoscale structural and chemical complexity of apatite-based mineralized tissues is a formidable challenge to quantitative imaging. For example, even energy-filtered electron microscopy is not suitable for detection of small quantities of low atomic number elements typical for biological materials. Herein we show that laser-pulsed atom probe tomography, a technique that combines subnanometer spatial resolution with unbiased chemical sensitivity, is uniquely suited to the task. Common apatite end members share a number of features, but can clearly be distinguished by their spectrometric fingerprint. This fingerprint and the formation of molecular ions during field evaporation can be explained based on the chemistry of the apatite channel ion. Using end members for reference, we are able to interpret the spectra of bone and dentin samples, and generate the first three-dimensional reconstruction of 1.2 × 10(7) atoms in a dentin sample. The fibrous nature of the collagenous organic matrix in dentin is clearly recognizable in the reconstruction. Surprisingly, some fibers show selectivity in binding for sodium ions over magnesium ions, implying that an additional, chemical level of hierarchy is necessary to describe dentin structure. Furthermore, segregation of inorganic ions or small organic molecules to homophase interfaces (grain boundaries) is not apparent. This has implications for the platelet model for apatite biominerals.},

abstract = {Stable isotope ratios of sulfur ($\delta$34S) and oxygen ($\delta$18O) in marine sulfate respond to changes in fluxes and processes in the global sulfur cycle. The two isotope systems respond on different time scales to different factors affecting the global sulfur cycle. Sulfur isotopes respond primarily to the relative fluxes of weathering-derived sulfate to the oceans versus the net flux of sulfur exported from the oceans as pyrite in marine sediments. At the present day, this response is relatively slow (∼20 Ma) because of the large size of the marine sulfate reservoir; ancient oceans had lower sulfate concentrations and thus sulfate residence times may have been shorter. The $\delta$34S of marine sulfate is also sensitive to the development of a significant reservoir of H2S in ancient stratified oceans. Sulfate-oxygen isotopes respond primarily to changes in the cycling of sulfur in the oceans and marine sediments. Sulfur disproportionation, oxic and anaerobic sulfide oxidation all impart different $\delta$18O signatures to marine sulfate; the relative importance of these different processes is in turn controlled by the distribution of redox conditions and microbial ecology of sea-floor sediments. The mutual interpretation of changes in marine sulfate $\delta$34S and $\delta$18O can thus give rather precise information on the nature of changes in global sulfur cycling. Recently, records of isotope compositions of ancient marine sulfate have become available through the analysis of carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) in limestones and marine biogenic barite, both of which provide far more continuous records than previous data based primarily on marine evaporite sulfate minerals. We review a number of case studies which use sulfur or combined sulfur and oxygen isotopic records derived from CAS and biogenic barite. Proterozoic CAS-sulfur isotope datasets often show marked variations over very small stratigraphic intervals (e.g. 20‰ over 300 m). When examined in conjunction with estimates of deposition rates, they are used to infer a new evolutionary curve of marine sulfate concentrations and therefore a protracted oxidation of the Earth's biosphere. Through the Cretaceous-Tertiary interval, the marine sulfate-sulfur record is characterised by significant periods of relative stability punctuated by phases of more rapid change (limited to 7‰ variation over the last 130 Ma). The Carboniferous was characterized essentially by a gradual change of 9‰ over 60 Ma. By contrast, at the Permian-Triassic boundary, extreme changes occur over very short geological time scales (14‰ over {\textless} 1 Ma); simple mass balance considerations suggest the development of a large, relatively short-lived, reservoir of H2S in the oceanic water column at this time. In this case, it is the short time scale of the response of the sulfate-oxygen record that enables the interpretation of rapid changes in oceanic redox state. Over the last 10 Ma, sulfate-oxygen $\delta$18O in biogenic barite exhibits large isotope changes (∼7‰) that occur independently of those in sulfate-sulfur. These changes must reflect changes in depositional/redox environment at the ocean margins and/or changes in microbial cycling of sulfur, but the exact cause remains controversial. Our limited understanding of the influence of redox environment and sediment microbial ecology on sulfur cycling currently restricts the level to which we are able to interpret such changes in marine sulfate $\delta$18O. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To date, density and other thermodynamic properties of seawater have been calculated from Practical Salinity, SP. It is more accurate however to use Absolute Salinity, SA (the mass fraction of dissolved material in seawater). Absolute Salinity SA can be expressed 5 in terms of Practical Salinity SP as SA=(35.165 04 g kg−1/35)SP +  SA(',  , p) where  SA is the Absolute Salinity Anomaly as a function of longitude ', latitude   and pressure. When a seawater sample has standard composition (i.e. the ratios of the constituents of sea salt are the same as those of surface water of the North Atlantic), 10 the Absolute Salinity Anomaly is zero. When seawater is not of standard composition, the Absolute Salinity Anomaly needs to be estimated; this anomaly is as large as 0.025 g kg−1 in the northernmost North Pacific. Here we provide an algorithm for estimating Absolute Salinity Anomaly for any location (',  , p) in the world ocean. To develop this algorithm we use the Absolute Salinity Anomaly that is found by 15 comparing the density calculated from Practical Salinity to the density measured in the laboratory. These estimates of Absolute Salinity Anomaly however are limited to the number of available observations (namely 811). To expand our data set we take advantage of approximate relationships between Absolute Salinity Anomaly and silicate concentrations (which are available globally). We approximate the laboratory20 determined values of  SA of the 811 seawater samples as a series of simple functions of the silicate concentration of the seawater sample and latitude; one function for each ocean basin. We use these basin-specific correlations and a digital atlas of silicate in the world ocean to deduce the Absolute Salinity Anomaly globally and this is stored as an atlas,  SA(',  , p). This atlas can be interpolated to the latitude, longitude and 25 pressure of a seawater sample to estimate its Absolute Salinity Anomaly. For the 811 samples studied, ignoring the Absolute Salinity Anomaly results in a standard error in SA of 0.0107 g kg−1. Using our algorithm for  SA reduces the error to 0.0048 g kg−1, reducing the mean square error by a factor of five. The number of sea 216 water samples used to develop the correlation relationship is limited, and we hope that the algorithm and error can be improved as further data becomes available.},

abstract = {IN the 35 years since A. C. Redfield's classic paper(1), the use of elemental ratios has become widespread in marine and freshwater phytoplankton studies(2,3). But nutrient ratios have only recently been studied elsewhere in pelagic ecosystems, such as the producer-consumer interface(4,5). Here we report the results of the first study, to our knowledge, of N:P ratios in pelagic producers and consumers (phytoplankton and zooplankton) in lacustrine and marine habitats. The N:P ratio of phytoplankton was higher in lakes than in marine sites; however, N:P ratios were higher in marine zooplankton than in freshwater zooplankton. The elemental imbalance of the phytoplankton-zooplankton interaction (N:P-food-N:P-consumers) in lakes was positive and exceeded the negative imbalance in marine sites; thus P-deficient food may limit zooplankton growth in lakes but not in oceans. Stoichiometric calculations(6) indicated that consumer-driven nutrient recycling ratios in lakes may be 4-6 times higher than in marine systems. Consistent with this difference, phytoplankton P-limitation was more prevalent in lakes than in marine sites. Thus, the ecological stoichiometry of the zooplankton-phytoplankton interaction differs qualitatively in freshwater and marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Coordination environments of B impurities in concentration levels on the order of parts per million in calcite and aragonite have been studied by B-11 MAS NMR spectroscopy.  B-O coordination in these polymorphs of CaCO3 has been found to be very sensitive to the carbonate crystal structure.  In calcite, B occurs principally in trigonal coordination, whereas it occurs in tetrahedral coordination in aragonite.  On phase transformation from aragonite to calcite, B changes its coordination accordingly.  Thus, B impurities reside in the CaCO3 crystal structure rather than in fluid inclusions or trace mineral phases.  Isolated BO3(3-) anions are most likely to replace CO3(2-) anions in the calcite structure, through a process of coupled substitution in order to maintain the electrical neutrality.  On the other hand, the structural role of BO4(5-) tetrahedra in the aragonite structure is not clear.  The similarity in B isotopic composition between the two CaCO3 polymorphs, in spite of the difference in the B coordination states, implies disequilibrium between B in the CaCO3 structure and that in the parent solution.  Different coordination states of B in calcite and aragonite are the likely controlling factor behind the stronger partitioning of B into aragonite than into calcite from the parent solution.},

Regular phyllotaxis is found in virtually all higher plants, from mosses, over ferns, to gymnosperms and angiosperms. Due to its remarkable precision, its beauty and its accessibility, phyllotaxis has for centuries been the object of admiration and scientific examination. There have been numerous hypotheses to explain the nature of the mechanistic principle behind phyllotaxis, however, not all of them have been amenable to experimental examination. This is due mainly to the delicacy and small size of the shoot apical meristem, where plant organs are formed and the phyllotactic patterns are laid down. Recently, the combination of genetics, molecular tools and micromanipulation has resulted in the identification of auxin as a central player in organ formation and positioning. This paper discusses some aspects of phyllotactic patterns found in nature and summarizes our current understanding of the regulatory mechanism behind phyllotaxis.},

abstract = {Ice core records from Antarctica show large (??? 80 ppm) and regular climate-related changes in atmospheric CO2, with minimum values during glacial periods and maximum values during peak interglacials. The suggested role of the Southern Ocean in driving these changes is based on either the potential for increased utilization of surface nutrients or the potential for decreased ventilation of deep waters during glacial times. Several recent studies have invoked increased stratification of the Southern Ocean to explain lower glacial atmospheric CO2 levels in terms of reduced exchange of CO2 between the deep sea and the atmosphere. A northward displacement and/or substantial weakening of the westerly winds during glacial periods are implicit in the scenarios that invoke enhanced stratification. However, both circulation models and proxy results argue against a weakening of the westerlies. In fact, the mean flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and wind-driven upwelling during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are thought to be at least as vigorous as those which exist today. Given these boundary conditions, we offer two (competing) scenarios for ecosystem structure and export production of the glacial Southern Ocean. The first scenario satisfies all proxy records for nutrient utilization and phytoplankton growth rate, and requires increased (relative to today) nitrate utilization south of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) by phytoplankton other than diatoms, together with a shift in the zone of maximum diatom growth from south (interglacials) to north (glacials) of the APF. The second scenario has reduced growth of all phytoplankton species south of the APF during glacials, and a shift in the zone of maximum export production to the north of the Polar Front. The principal weakness of the first scenario is that there is little sedimentary evidence to support the increased export of particulate organic carbon required by the inferred increase in nitrate utilization south of the APF. The principal weakness of the second scenario is that it requires a change in the isotopic fractionation of nitrogen by phytoplankton growing south of the Polar Front for reasons presently unknown. The Southern Ocean's biological pump at the LGM has yet to be characterized unequivocally. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) is an increasingly popular analytical technique, that is able to provide spatially resolved, minimally destructive analyses of heterogeneous materials. The data produced by this technique are inherently complex, and require extensive processing and subjective expert interpretation to produce useful compositional data. At present, laboratories employ diverse protocols for data processing, and the reporting of these protocols is usually insufficient to allow data processing to be independently replicated, rendering the resulting data untraceable. Importantly, different expert users can obtain significantly different results from the same raw data using nominally identical processing workflows, depending on how ‘contaminants' are identified and excluded, and which regions of signal are selected as representative of the composition of the sample. The irreproducibility of LA-ICPMS is a significant problem for the technique, but the complexity of the raw data has been a major hindrance to developing traceable data processing workflows. Here, we present LAtools – a free, open-source Python package for LA-ICPMS data processing designed with reproducibility at its core. The software performs basic data processing with similar efficacy to existing software, and brings a number of new data selection algorithms to facilitate reproducible reduction of LA-ICPMS data. We discuss the key advances of LAtools, and compare its output to trace metal analysis of marine CaCO3 (foraminifera) processed both manually and with Iolite, and to manually processed trace element data from zircon grains.},

In the past year, studies in different systems have greatly enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these phenomena. The ubiquitous presence of PTGS in both the plant and animal kingdoms and the finding of common genetic mechanisms suggest that PTGS is a universal gene-regulation system fundamental in biological processes such as protection against viruses and transposons.},

abstract = {In the bivalve mollusc Mytilus edulis shell thickening occurs from the extrapallial (EP) fluid wherein secreted shell matrix macromolecules are thought to self-assemble into a framework that regulates the growth of CaCO(3) crystals, which eventually constitute approximately 95{\%} of the mature shell. Herein is the initial report on the purification and characterization of a novel EP fluid glycoprotein, which is likely a building block of the shell-soluble organic matrix. This primary EP fluid protein comprises 56{\%} of the total protein in the fluid and is shown to be a dimer of 28,340 Da monomers estimated to be 14.3{\%} by weight carbohydrate. The protein is acidic (pI = 4.43) and rich in histidine content (11.14{\%}) as well as in Asx and Glx residues (25.15{\%} total). The N terminus exhibits an unusual repeat sequence of histidine and aspartate residues that occur in pairs: NPVDDHHDDHHDAPIVEHHD approximately. Ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrate that the protein binds calcium and in so doing assembles into a series of higher order protomers, which appear to have extended structures. Circular dichroism shows that the protein-calcium binding/protomer formation is coupled to a significant rearrangement in the protein's secondary structure in which there is a major reduction in beta-sheet with an associated increase in alpha-helical content of the protein. A model for shell organic matrix self-assembly is proposed.},

abstract = {We investigated the isotopic composition of calcium in the metastable calcium carbonate polymorphs vaterite and ikaite. The synthetic vaterite precipitates show a smaller degree of Ca isotope fractionation than calcite or aragonite at comparable temperatures and revealed no significant temperature sensitivity between 10 and 50??C. Ikaite, the water-bearing Ca carbonate modification (CaCO3??6H2O) was precipitated at 2??C in controlled laboratory experiments and in addition recovered from marine sediments and sea-ice. Synthetic and natural ikaites show similar values of Ca isotope fractionation. In general, ikaite is less depleted in heavy isotopes compared to calcite or aragonite at low temperatures. The observed offset of vaterite and ikaite to calcite or aragonite precipitated at similar temperatures is presumably mainly related to differences in precipitation rates and regimes, which seem however to be typical for the growth of these carbonate minerals. Small differences in Ca isotope ratios of naturally formed ikaites from different locations seem to be related to different geochemical conditions in the respective sediment settings. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Direct effects on non-target species, and the possibility of unintentionally transferring traits of ecological relevance onto landraces and wild relatives have also been sources of concern. The degree of genetic connectivity between industrial crops and their progenitors in landraces and wild relatives is a principal determinant of the evolutionary history of crops and agroecosystems throughout the world. Recent introductions of transgenic DNA constructs into agricultural fields provide unique markers to measure such connectivity. For these reasons, the detection of transgenic DNA in crop landraces is of critical importance. Here we report the presence of introgressed transgenic DNA constructs in native maize landraces grown in remote mountains in Oaxaca, Mexico, part of the Mesoamerican centre of origin and diversification of this crop.},

abstract = {Formation of biomineral structures is increasingly attributed to directed growth of a mineral phase from an amorphous precursor on an organic matrix. While many in vitro studies have used calcite formation on organothiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as a model system to investigate this process, they have generally focused on the stability of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) or maximizing control over the order of the final mineral phase. Little is known about the early stages of mineral formation, particularly the structural evolution of the SAM and mineral. Here we use near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (NEXAFS), photoemission spectroscopy (PES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to address this gap in knowledge by examining the changes in order and bonding of mercaptophenol (MP) SAMs on Au(111) during the initial stages of mineral formation as well as the mechanism of ACC to calcite transformation during template-directed crystallization.

abstract = {This review provides an assessment of sediment trap accuracy issues by gathering data to address trap hydrodynamics, the problem of zooplankton "swimmers," and the solubilization of material after collection. For each topic, the problem is identified, its magnitude and causes reviewed using selected examples, and an update on methods to correct for the potential bias or minimize the problem using new technologies is presented. To minimize hydrodynamic biases due to flow over the trap mouth, the use of neutrally buoyant sediment traps is encouraged. The influence of swimmers is best minimized using traps that limit zooplankton access to the sample collection chamber. New data on the impact of different swimmer removal protocols at the US time-series sites HOT and BATS are compared and shown to be important. Recent data on solubilization are compiled and assessed suggesting selective losses from sinking particles to the trap supernatant after collection, which may alter both fluxes and ratios of elements in long term and typically deeper trap deployments. Different methods are needed to assess shallow and short- term trap solubilization effects, but thus far new incubation experiments suggest these impacts to be small for most elements. A discussion of trap calibration methods reviews independent assessments of flux, including elemental budgets, particle abundance and flux modeling, and emphasizes the utility of U-Th radionuclide calibration methods.},

These laws are characterized by the exponent relating the fractionation factors for two isotope ratios such that 2/1 3/1 . The exponent for equilibrium exchange is (1/m1 1/m2)/(1/m1 1/m3), where mi are the atomic masses and m1 m2 m3. For kinetic fractionation, the masses used to evaluate depend upon the isotopic species in motion. Reduced masses apply for breaking bonds whereas molecular or atomic masses apply for transport processes. In each case the functional form of the kinetic is ln(M1/M2)/ln(M1/M3), where Mi are the reduced, molecular, or atomic masses. New high-precision Mg isotope ratio data confirm that the distinct equilibrium and kinetic fractionation laws can be resolved for changes in isotope ratios of only 3‰ per amu. The variability in mass-dependent fractionation laws is sufficient to explain the negative 17O of tropospheric O2 relative to rocks and differences in 17O between carbonate, hydroxyl, and anhydrous silicate in Martian meteorites. (For simplicity, we use integer amu values for masses when evaluating throughout this paper.)},

abstract = {The relationship between atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) and climate in the Quaternary period has been extensively investigated, but the role of CO 2 in temperature changes during the rest of Earth's history is less clear 1 . The range of geological evidence for cool periods during the high CO 2 Mesozoic 'greenhouse world' 2,3 of high atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, indicated by models 4 and fossil soils 5 , has been particularly difficult to interpret. Here, we present high-resolution records of Mesozoic and early Cenozoic atmospheric CO 2 concentrations from a combination of carbon-isotope analyses of non-vascular plant (bryophyte) fossils and theoretical modelling 6,7 . These records indicate that atmospheric CO 2 rose from ∼420 p.p.m.v. in the Triassic period (about 200 million years ago) to a peak of ∼1,130 p.p.m.v. in the Middle Cretaceous (about 100 million years ago). Atmospheric CO 2 levels then declined to ∼680 p.p.m.v. by 60 million years ago. Time-series comparisons show that these variations coincide with large Mesozoic climate shifts 8–10 , in contrast to earlier suggestions of climate– CO 2 decoupling during this interval 1 . These reconstructed atmospheric CO 2 concentrations drop below the simulated threshold for the initiation of glaciations 11 on several occasions and therefore help explain the occurrence of cold intervals in a 'greenhouse world' 3 . The fundamental role of CO 2 as a driver of past warm climates in the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic periods remains obscured for a number of reasons. Different proxies (fossil leaf stomatal indices and palaeosols) yield widely disparate CO 2 estimates for this critical phase in Earth's history 3 ; in general, palaeosols 5 suggest CO 2 levels thousands of p.p.m.v. higher than fossil leaves 12 . Furthermore, it is unclear whether mismatches between oxygen-isotope-based ($\delta$ 18 O) palaeoclimate records and ancient CO 2 estimates 1 , either from proxies or numerical carbon-cycle models 2–4 , genuinely reflect decoupling between CO 2 and climate or are an artefact associated with the difficulties of accurately reconstructing these critical features of Earth's history 13 . However, evidence for brief (typically {\textless} 1 Myr) cool pulses punctuating generally warm Jurassic and Cretaceous climates is challenging the prevailing high CO 2 Mesozoic 'greenhouse world' paradigm 3 indicated by palaeosols 5},

abstract = {Ostracods are small bivalved aquatic crustaceans. They secrete shells of low-Mg calcite that are often preserved in lake sediments. Recent work has shown that the uptake of trace elements (especially Mg and Sr) into the shell may be a function of the salinity and temperature of the host water. Furthermore, ostracod shells are a source of carbonate for stable-isotope analysis. This paper reviews the application of ostracod shell chemistry to Quaternary palaeolimnology. Although such work has revealed the excellent potential of these techniques to provide quantitative palaeolimnological reconstructions, a number of problems have also emerged. These problems relate to (1) methods used for extraction of ostracod shells from sediment and their subsequent cleaning (2) post-mortem diagenesis and alteration of the shell (3) complications with the calcification mechanism (4) spatial and temporal variability in shell composition (5) the ecological tolerances of individual species and (6) the relationships between shell chemistry and palaeohydrology. To some extent, these problems are an inevitable outcome of the diversity of lacustrine systems: they may be overcome by developing a thorough understanding of the physiology, life-cycle and ecology of the species concerned, together with the modern limnology of the study site. Overall, these techniques have excellent potential in Quaternary palaeolimnology, especially when used with other palaeoenvironmental indicators.},

abstract = {The incorporation of Sr2+ into calcite at earth surface aqueous conditions is affected by the absolute concentration of Sr2+, the presence of Ba2+ and NaCl in the solution, and the rate of precipitation. At solution ratios (molar) of Sr2+ to Ca2+ in the low 10-3 range, which yield calcites with several hundred ppm Sr2+, Ksrcalcite typically assumes a value between 0.10 and 0.20. Above these concentrations the value of kSrcalcite drops to approximately 0.06. Furthermore, if minor amounts of Ba2+ or large amounts of Na+ (0.48 M) are added to a dilute Sr2+ solution, a value around 0.06 for kSrcalciteis found. This "strontium concentration effect" and the associated "competitive cation effect" suggest that small amounts of Sr2+ may be incorporated into a limited number of nonlattice sites in calcite. Incorporation of Sr2+ into these sites, presumably defects, noticeably affects kSrcalcite only at low Sr2+ concentrations and in the absence of competition from other large cations. An increase in kSrcalcite with rate of precipitation, qualitatively similar to that found in other studies, was observed only when precipitation times were decreased from days to hours. For many geologic settings a partition coefficient for Sr2+ into calcite of 0.06 appears appropriate, but there are situations-very low Sr2+ concentrations, the presence of Mg2+, and fast precipitation rates-in which a larger value might better approximate natural partitioning. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotopic analyses of pelagic Foraminifera from Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific deep-sea cores in- dicate that the temperature of superficial waters in the equatorial Atlantic and Caribbean underwent peri- odic oscillations during the Pleistocene with an amplitude of about 6° C. The temperature record of the Pacific cores was much affected by local oceanographic conditions. Seven complete temperature cycles are shown by a Caribbean core. By extrapolating rates of sedimenta- tion based on radiocarbon data, an age of about 280,000 years is obtained for the earliest temperature minimum. Correlation with continental events suggests that the earliest temperature minimum corresponds to the first major glaciation. The chronology of Pacific cores proposed by Arrhenius (1952) must be modified if correspondence with the chronology of Atlantic and Caribbean cores is desired. In one Pacific core which extends to the Pliocene, the 610-cm. level below top is believed to represent the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. About fifteen complete temperature cycles occur above this level, and the length of Pleistocene time is estimated at about 600,000 years. The so-called pre-Giinzian stages appear to span a time interval about as long as the Gtinz and post-Giinzian stages. A glacial lowering of sea-level of about 100 m. is indicated. Closely spaced samples from short pilot cores furnish a detailed temperature record for postglacial times. A continuous temperature increase from about 16,500 to about 6,000 years ago is indicated, followed by a small temperature decrease. The temperature maximum at about 6,000 years ago is correlated with the "Climatic Optimum." Isotopic analyses of calcareous benthonic Foraminifera show that the temperature of bottom water in the equatorial Pacific during glacial ages was similar to the present, but in the eastern equatorial Atlantic it was about 2.10 C. lower. This difference resulted from the large amount of marine ice present in the North Atlantic. Interglacial bottom temperature in the equatorial Pacific was not more than about 0.80 C. higher than glacial temperatures; interglacial data for the equatorial Atlantic are inconclusive with respect to temper- ature but indicate an influx of ice meltwater along the bottom larger than at present. Correspondence in time between temperature variations in the low latitudes, as shown by the cores, and glacial events in the high northern latitudes indicates close correspondence between glacial or interglacial phases and wet or dry phases, respectively. Good correlation exists between times of temperature minima as indicated by extrapolated rates of sedi- mentation and times of insolation minima in high northern latitudes. Control of world climate during the Pleistocene by insolation in the high northern latitudes is indicated. A retardation of about 5,000 years oc- curred between temperature and insolation cycles. Complete revision of current correlations between the insolation curve and continental events is neces- sary. The glacial epoch and its ages may be explained by a theory combining topographical and insolation effects. Conditions may be suitable for the beginning of a new ice age in about 10,000 years.

abstract = {Exposed sediments of 50m thickness were investigated in the 120,000km2 Qaidam Basin at the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Fine-grained silty sediments constitute most of the section and were accumulated in a lake. Intercalated beds of aeolian sand, and of fluvial or littoral origin, show that the lake experienced periods of desiccation and shallow water levels at the section site. The lake sediments provided surprisingly species-rich ostracod assemblages with almost all species indicating freshwater to oligohaline conditions. The species richness, the position of the section in the southern neighbourhood of a topographic rise in the Qaidam Basin and intercalated layers of fluvial and aeolian sands suggest that a relatively marginal, littoral lake setting existed throughout most of the sequence. A maximum water depth of several tens of metres may be assumed at least for some parts of the section, and a large lake covering about half the size of the Qaidam Basin may be inferred from our data. This inference is in clear contrast to the present-day wind-shaped topography with salt playas and shallow saline lakes in the lowermost depressions of the Qaidam Basin. Dating by optically stimulated luminescence and uranium-series measurements did not allow the establishment of a firm chronology for the investigated section. However, based on infrared stimulated luminescence dates of around 120-140ka obtained on feldspars and regarded as minimum ages; and 230Th/U ages scattering between 100 and 400ka, a Middle Pleistocene age between 120 and 400ka is assumed for the lake formation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

abstract = {There is compelling evidence that the breeding phenology of many species has changed substantially in recent decades. However, taxonomic and spatial variation in the direction and rate of change is still not well understood. We explored these issues by analysing a dataset containing information on first egg dates of 10 species of seabird at two major breeding colonies (86 km apart) in the western North Sea over a period of 35 years. Within a species, timing of breeding was positively correlated between the two colonies, suggesting that factors factors affecting the phenology of these species operated at a regional rather than a colony scale. Comparison of time trends among the species revealed contrasting patterns, with some showing no systematic change, others becoming earlier and others later. The clearest species groupings appeared to be among the terns with arrival and/or first egg dates becoming earlier in Arctic Terns Sterna paradisaea, Common Terns Sterna hirundo and Sandwich Terns Sterna sandvicensis, and among the auks (Common Guillemot Uria aalge, Razorbill Alca torda and Atlantic Puffin Fratercula arctica) and Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla where the trend was in the opposite direction towards later breeding. This general trend towards later breeding in the latter group of species contrasts with correlational evidence from many other organisms indicating that breeding phenology is advancing in response to climate change.},

abstract = {We demonstrate, using molecular-dynamics computer simulations, the strong influence of surface wettability on the equilibrium structure of the electrical double layer at solid interfaces and on electrokinetic transport in aqueous electrolytes due to the effects of interfacial ion specificity and hydrodynamic slip. In particular, we show that anomalous electrokinetic effects such as nonzero zeta potentials for uncharged surfaces are general features of electro-osmotic flow in hydrophobic channels for electrolytes with substantial cation/anion size asymmetry, as a result of the stronger attraction of the larger ion to the "vapor-liquid-like" interface induced by a hydrophobic surface. We establish that the simulated velocity profiles obey continuum hydrodynamics on the nanoscopic length scales studied and show that the anomalous flow profiles can be accurately predicted by using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann description for the ion density distributions that incorporates an ion-size-dependent hydrophobic solvation energy as a crucial component. We also demonstrate that, counterintuitively, the flow for a charge-neutral fluid is independent of the solid-fluid friction coefficient.},

abstract = {Sr/Ca, B/Ca, Mg/Ca and ??11B were determined at high spatial resolution across ???1 year of a modern Hawaiian Porites lobata coral by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). We observe significant variations in B/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and ??11B over short skeletal distances (nominally equivalent to periods of {\textless}20 days). This heterogeneity probably reflects variations in the composition of the extracellular calcifying fluid (ECF) from which the skeleton precipitates. Calcification site pH (total scale) was estimated from skeletal ??11B and ranged from 8.3 to 8.8 (?? ???0.1) with a mean of ???8.6. Sr/Ca and B/Ca heterogeneity is not simply correlated with calcification site pH, as might be expected if Ca-ATPase activity increases the pH and decreases the Sr/Ca and B(OH)4
-/CO3
2- ratios of the ECF. We produced a simple model of the ECF composition and the skeleton deposited from it, over a range of calcium transport and carbonate scenarios, which can account for these observed geochemical variations. The relationship between the pH and Sr/Ca of the ECF is dependent on the concentration of DIC at the calcification site. At higher DIC concentrations the ECF has a high capacity to buffer the [H+] changes induced by Ca-ATPase pumping. Conversely, at low DIC concentrations, this buffering capacity is reduced and ECF pH changes more rapidly in response to Ca-ATPase pumping. The absence of a simple correlation between ECF pH and skeletal Sr/Ca implies that calcification occurred under a range of DIC concentrations, reflecting variations in the respiration and photosynthesis of the coral and symbiotic zooxanthellate in the overlying coral tissues. Our observations have important implications for the use of coral skeletons as indicators of palaeo-ocean pH. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Laboratory experiments on the branching, symbiont-bearing coral genus Porites and Acropora have been carried out to determine the dependence of the skeletal boron isotopic composition ($\delta$11B) on the pH of seawater. The results show a clear relationship similar to previously established empirical calibrations for planktonic foraminifera and inorganic calcite. A -0.6‰ offset exists between P. cylindrica and A. nobilis which is systematic over the pH range of 7.7 - 8.2. To test whether the $\delta$11B of coral skeletons changes with physiological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration, corals were grown along a depth transect in their natural environment and under controlled conditions in the laboratory at varying light intensities and food supply. Although we also observe an isotopic offset between P. compressa and Montipora verrucosa, neither experimental treatment systematically changed the $\delta$11B of the two species. These findings are encouraging for using the boron isotope paleo-pH proxy in corals, because it appears that seawater pH is the dominant control on the boron isotopic composition in corals. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We combine experimental findings on ants and bees, and build on earlier models, to give an account of how these insects navigate using path integration, and how path integration interacts with other modes of navigation. At the core of path integration is an accumulator. This is set to an initial state at the nest and is updated as the insect moves so that it always reports the insect's current position relative to the nest. Navigation that uses path integration requires, in addition, a way of storing states of the accumulator at significant places for subsequent recall as goals, and a means of computing the direction to such goals. We discuss three models of how path integration might be used for this process, which we call vector navigation. Vector navigation is the principal means of navigating over unfamiliar terrain, or when landmarks are unavailable. Under other conditions, insects often navigate by landmarks, and ignore the output of the vector navigation system. Landmark navigation does not interfere with the updating of the accumulator. There is an interesting symmetry in the use of landmarks and path integration. In the short term, vector navigation can be independent of landmarks, and landmark navigation needs no assistance from path integration. In the longer term, visual landmarks help keep path vector navigation calibrated, and the learning of visual landmarks is guided by path integration.},

abstract = {Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research. {\textcopyright} 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The paper catalogues the development of knowledge that has increasingly challenged the conven- tional understanding (the paradigm) that the predominant pathway of energy flow in pelagic systems is founded on the primary production of phytoplankton, its consumption by herbivorous zooplankton and, in turn, the feeding of larger carnivorous animals, including fish of commercial value. Aquatic food webs are now recognised to be more diverse in their carbon sources, more complex in structure and more versatile in their function. Adjacent terrestrial catchments supply nutrients and, crucially, dis- solved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon. Pivotal roles in the processing of autochthonous organic carbon are often fulfilled by pelagic microbes and bacterivorous nanoplankton and microplankton. Mesozooplankton consumes algae directly if sufficiently concen- trated but is itself a limiting resource to pelagic fish, which either must be specially adapted to gather sufficient zooplankton or must switch to benthic or littoral foods. Opportunistic feeding by such fish, though primarily nourished in the inshore, continues to control abundant zooplankton. Mobility and dietary electivity of adult fish integrate the pelagic food web into that of the benthos. Except in very large lakes and in the open ocean, the influence of benthic food webs influences the flow of carbon within the pelagic and beyond, serving to invalidate the traditional paradigm of trophic relationships and demanding formulation of another},

The emphasis is on integration of evidence from crystallographic and ultrastructural studies but additional relevant information from biochemical and phylogenetic work is reviewed. We attempt to identify aspects of ultrastructure which are most likely to be the product of self-organising processes. The principal topics reviewed are heterococcolith rim nucleation, including reassessment of the V/R model; crystal growth regulation in heterococcoliths; holococcolith biomineralisation; and the diversity of other biomineralisation modes in haptophytes. It is concluded that the diverse range of calcareous structures produced by haptophytes probably has a common phylogenetic origin and is produced via operation of a limited set of mainly shared genetic and biochemical pathways.

abstract = {Factors controlling the timing of major ({\textgreater}10 mg chlorophyll a m -3) spring bloom events in the estuarine waters of the Solent, on the south coast of the UK, have been investigated. Winter to summer variations in chlorophyll a concentration together with relevant meteorological and hydrographical data have been analysed for 5 years (1988, 1992, 2001, 2002 and 2003). Mean water column irradiance is demonstrated to be the main factor controlling the timing of the first major spring bloom event, usually dominated by large chain-forming diatoms. When chlorophyll a concentration first exceeds 10 mg m-3 in spring (usually in May) the mean water column photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) averaged for one week prior to the sampling date was always {\textgreater}380 W h m-2 d-1. Prior to the main spring bloom event surface incident radiation and water turbidity combine to limit chlorophyll a concentration to levels {\textless}10 mg m-3. Chlorophyll a concentrations {\textgreater}10 mg m-3 do not occur in the Solent until almost the entire 10 m water column is within the euphotic zone (i.e. above 1{\%} light level) and light extinction coefficient (k) is ca. ???0.5 m -1. Statistically, river flow explains the largest percentage of the variations in k and the delayed bloom in June 2002 is due to increased cloud cover and high levels of rainfall in May, which caused a reduction in surface incident irradiance and increased turbidity. Chlorophyll a peaks during these major bloom events generally occur on spring tides when increased mixing rates favour net growth of diatoms. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As part of the ANTARES 3/F-JGOFS cruise, the distributions of dissolved iron and manganese were measured in October 1995 in the north-east wake of the Kerguelen archipelago (48??40???-49??40???S, 68??70???-70??50???E), an area that shows high phytoplankton biomass (CZCS and SeaWiFS data) in the middle of the High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) Southern Ocean. The study area (about 25,000 km2) comprised a branch of the Polar Front with Antarctic surface water (AASW) intruding northward, shouldering the shelf break of the Kerguelen Plateau. The coastal zone was clearly affected by material of lithogenic origin (riverine discharges, soil leaching by rain waters, aeolian inputs), as well as by inputs from the sediments (effluxes from the sediment-water interface, resuspension from the sediments), its near surface waters showing considerable enrichment in dissolved iron (5.3-12.6 nM) and in dissolved manganese (2.9-8.6 nM). The offshore waters, although less enriched in trace-metals, were also affected by trace-metal inputs from coastal and continental shelf origin. Dissolved iron and manganese concentrations in these waters were 0.46-0.71 and 0.68-1.3 nM, i.e. far over typical antarctic open ocean surface water concentrations of 0.16 nM for iron [Martin, J.H., Gordon, R.M., Fitzwater, S.E., 1990. Iron in Antarctic waters. Nature, 345: 156-158.] and around 0.1 nM for manganese [Martin, J.H., Gordon, R.M., Fitzwater, S.E., 1990. Iron in Antarctic waters.

Deep-Sea Res., 44: 1239-1253.]. The dissolved iron enrichment in coastal waters of the Kerguelen Islands is much more important (about 10 times for dissolved iron) than for the Galapagos Islands, another oasis in the HNLC Equatorial oceanic system, where the concentration increase in dissolved iron in the surface waters around the islands is mostly driven by upwelling of the Equatorial Under Current (EUC) as it reaches the Galapagos Platform. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Mussels of a similar size, originating from the same population, have been grown in the field and the high resolution distribution of Mg, Mn, Sr, Ba and Pb in their calcite shell layer, as determined by Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry, has been compared to temporal variations of environmental parameters. All elements exhibit cyclic variations with an annual periodicity. The Mg, Sr and Pb cycles show great similarity and are characterised by a broad maximum during spring and early summer. These profiles cannot be explained by seasonal variations in the seawater composition. Skeletal Mg covaries reproducibly with temperature during spring but this covariation is abruptly interrupted after the spring phytoplankton bloom. The absence of a constant Mg-temperature relationship over the year hampers the direct use of Mg in M. edulis calcite as a high resolution temperature proxy. The sharp peak that is dominating each skeletal Ba cycle coincides with the annual algal biomass maximum and presumably reflects elevated concentrations of particulate Ba, associated with the spring phytoplankton bloom. Similarly, elevated skeletal Mn concentrations during spring might reflect bloom-induced increases in particulate Mn. Skeletal ??13C shows a seasonal variation, characterised by a minimum that coincides with the MN maximum. These ??13C variations are not in equilibrium with the seasonal ??13C trend of the seawater dissolved inorganic carbon and presumably reflect fluctuations in the contribution of metabolic carbon to the shell carbonate, corresponding to seasonal variations in the mussel's respiration rate.

Anaerobic mineralization of acetate, propionate and L-lactate was studied in the presence and in the absence of sulfate. In freshwater and in marine sediments, acetate and propionate were oxidized completely with concomitant reduction of sulfate. L-Lactate was always fermented. Lactate-oxidizing, sulfate-reducing bacteria, belonging to the species Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, and lactate-fermenting bacteria were found in approximately equal numbers in the sediments. Acetate-oxidizing, sulfate-reducing bacteria could only be isolated from marine sediments; they belonged to the genus Desulfobacter and oxidized only acetate and ethanol by sulfate reduction. Propionate-oxidizing, sulfate-reducing bacteria belonged to the genus Desulfobulbus. They were isolated from freshwater as well as from marine sediments and showed a relatively large range of usable substrates: hydrogen, formate, propionate, L-lactate and ethanol were oxidized with concomitant sulfate reduction.

abstract = {Biominerals can achieve complex shapes as aggregates of crystalline building blocks. In the red coral skeleton, we observe that these building blocks are arranged into eight hierarchical levels of similarly (but not identically) oriented modules. The modules in each hierarchical level assemble into larger units that comprise the next higher level of the hierarchy, and consist themselves of smaller, oriented modules. EBSD and TEM studies show that the degree of crystallographic misorientation between the building blocks decreases with decreasing module size. We observe this organization down to a few nanometers. Thus, the transition from imperfect crystallographic order at millimeter scale to nearly perfect single crystalline domains at nanometer scale is progressive. The concept of “mesocrystal” involves the three-dimensional crystallographic organization of nanoparticles into a highly ordered mesostructure. We add to this concept the notion of “multilevel modularity.” This modularity has potential implications for the origin of complex biomineral shapes in nature. A multi- level modular organization with small intermodular misorientations combines a simple construction scheme, ruled by crystallographic laws, with the possibility of complex shapes. If the observations we have made on red coral extend to other biominerals, long-range crystallographic order and interfaces at all scales may be key to how some biominerals achieve complex shapes adapted to the environment in which they grow.},

Repetitive stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fiber system led to decreases in [Ca2+]o and [Na+]o (??Ca, ??Na) by up to 0.5 mM and 13 mM, respectively. Iontophoretic application of glutamate or asparatate caused dose-dependent ??Ca of more than 1 mM and ??Na of more than 45 mM. Such ionic alterations were smaller in the presence of GABA or of the Ca2+ antagonists Ni2+ and Mg2+. Ca2+ signals were diminished when evoked in low-Na+ bathing medium and Na+ signals were reduced in Ca2+-free solutions. Thus glutamate- and aspartate-dependent decreases in [Na+]o and [Ca2+]o appear to be caused by 3 different mechanisms: Na+ movement through amino acid-activated ionophores; Ca2+ movement through selective channels, and Ca2+-dependent Na+ movement. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {In comparative experiments with Ca2+ ATPase in native sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles and reconstituted proteoliposomes, we find that a variable stoichiometry of Ca2+ or Sr2+ transport per ATPase cycle is observed in the absence of passive leak through independent channels. The observed ratio is commonly lower than the optimal value of 2 and depends on the composition of the reaction mixture. In all cases, a progressive rise in the lumenal concentration of Ca2+ and Sr2+ is accompanied by a parallel reduction of coupling ratios. Significant ATPase activity remains even after asymptotic levels of Ca2+ accumulation are reached. This residual activity subsides if the Ca2+ concentration in the outer medium is reduced below activating levels (as it would following Ca2+ transients in muscle fibers). The reduction of stoichiometric coupling is explained with a reaction scheme, including a branched pathway for hydrolytic cleavage of phosphorylated intermediate before release of Ca2+ into the lumen of the vesicles. Flux through this pathway is favored when net lumenal Ca2+ dissociation from the phosphoenzyme is impeded and results in P(i) production accompanied by lumenal and medium Ca2+ exchange. Occurrence of reactions through branched pathways may have general implications for the stoichiometric efficiency of energy-transducing enzymes.},

abstract = {Many glaciers along the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are accelerating and, for this reason, contribute increasingly to global sea-level rise. Globally, ice losses contribute approximately 1.8 mm yr(-1) (ref. 8), but this could increase if the retreat of ice shelves and tidewater glaciers further enhances the loss of grounded ice or initiates the large-scale collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheets. Ice loss as a result of accelerated flow, known as dynamic thinning, is so poorly understood that its potential contribution to sea level over the twenty-first century remains unpredictable. Thinning on the ice-sheet scale has been monitored by using repeat satellite altimetry observations to track small changes in surface elevation, but previous sensors could not resolve most fast-flowing coastal glaciers. Here we report the use of high-resolution ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) laser altimetry to map change along the entire grounded margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. To isolate the dynamic signal, we compare rates of elevation change from both fast-flowing and slow-flowing ice with those expected from surface mass-balance fluctuations. We find that dynamic thinning of glaciers now reaches all latitudes in Greenland, has intensified on key Antarctic grounding lines, has endured for decades after ice-shelf collapse, penetrates far into the interior of each ice sheet and is spreading as ice shelves thin by ocean-driven melt. In Greenland, glaciers flowing faster than 100 m yr(-1) thinned at an average rate of 0.84 m yr(-1), and in the Amundsen Sea embayment of Antarctica, thinning exceeded 9.0 m yr(-1) for some glaciers. Our results show that the most profound changes in the ice sheets currently result from glacier dynamics at ocean margins.},

abstract = {Fossil planktic foraminifers in the ocean sediments play an unparalleled role in our understanding of the oceanographic environment in the past. An in depth knowledge of their diversity, ecology and biogeography in the modern ocean lies central to the interpretation of the fossil assemblages. In comparison with their benthic counterparts, planktic foraminifera have a very limited diversity of around fifty extant morphospecies. Their morphospecies diversity peaks in the sub-tropics and decreases steeply towards the poles. Traditional species concepts have partitioned morphological types into distinct species (morphospecies) based on test shape, but genetic studies show that individual morphospecies are actually complexes of several discrete genetic types (genotypes). Many of these genotypes have distinct ecologies and novel adaptations that are consistent with species-level classification, indicating that the true diversity of planktic foraminifers has been greatly underestimated. Although planktic foraminifera are clearly capable of long-distance dispersal, they may be constrained by both physical and ecological barriers that vary according to the evolutionary history and ecology of the individual genotypes within a morphospecies. These differences lead to diverse biogeographies. Here, we provide an overview of the genetic and biogeographic data available to date for the planktic foraminifera and present global biogeographies highlighting the distribution of genetic types in the eight planktic foraminiferal morphospecies for which detailed molecular evidence is available. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Net primary production (NPP) is commonly modeled as a function of chlorophyll concentration (Chl), even though it has been long recognized that variability in intracellular chlorophyll content from light acclimation and nutrient stress confounds the relationship between Chl and phytoplankton biomass. It was suggested previously that satellite estimates of backscattering can be related to phytoplankton carbon biomass (C) under conditions of a conserved particle size distribution or a relatively stable relationship between C and total particulate organic carbon. Together, C and Chl can be used to describe physiological state (through variations in Chl:C ratios) and NPP. Here, we fully develop the carbon-based productivity model (CbPM) to include information on the subsurface light field and nitracline depths to parameterize photoacclimation and nutrient stress throughout the water column. This depth-resolved approach produces profiles of biological properties (Chl, C, NPP) that are broadly consistent with observations. The CbPM is validated using regional in situ data sets of irradiance-derived products, phytoplankton chlorophyll: carbon ratios, and measured NPP rates. CbPM-based distributions of global NPP are significantly different in both space and time from previous Chl-based estimates because of the distinction between biomass and physiological influences on global Chl fields. The new model yields annual, areally integrated water column production of similar to 52 Pg C a(-1) for the global oceans.},

abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations seem to have been several times modern levels during much of the Palaeozoic era (543-248 million years ago), but decreased during the Carboniferous period to concentrations similar to that of today(1-3). Given that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, it has been proposed that surface temperatures were significantly higher during the earlier portions of the Palaeozoic era(1). A reconstruction of tropical sea surface temperatures based on the delta O-18 of carbonate fossils indicates, however, that the magnitude of temperature variability throughout this period was small(4), suggesting that global climate may be independent of variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Here we present estimates of sea surface temperatures that were obtained from fossil brachiopod and mollusc shells using the 'carbonate clumped isotope' method(5)-an approach that, unlike the delta O-18 method, does not require independent estimates of the isotopic composition of the Palaeozoic ocean. Our results indicate that tropical sea surface temperatures were significantly higher than today during the Early Silurian period (443-423 Myr ago), when carbon dioxide concentrations are thought to have been relatively high, and were broadly similar to today during the Late Carboniferous period (314-300 Myr ago), when carbon dioxide concentrations are thought to have been similar to the present-day value. Our results are consistent with the proposal that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations drive or amplify increased global temperatures(1,6).},

abstract = {Rising atmospheric CO2 and deliberate CO2 sequestration in the ocean change seawater carbonate chemistry in a similar way, lowering seawater pH, carbonate ion concentration and carbonate saturation state and increasing dissolved CO2 concen- tration. These changes affect marine plankton in various ways. On the organismal level, a moderate increase in CO2 facilitates photosynthetic carbon fixation of some phytoplankton groups. It also enhances the release of dissolved carbohydrates, most notably during the decline of nutrient-limited phytoplankton blooms. A decrease in the carbonate saturation state represses biogenic calcification of the predominant marine calcifying organisms, foraminifera and coccolithophorids. On the ecosystem level these responses influence phytoplankton species composition and succession, favouring algal species which predominantly rely on CO2 utilization. Increased phytoplankton exudation promotes particle aggregation and marine snow formation, enhancing the vertical flux of biogenic material. A decrease in calcification may af- fect the competitive advantage of calcifying organisms, with possible impacts on their distribution and abundance. On the biogeochemical level, biological responses to CO2 enrichment and the related changes in carbonate chemistry can strongly alter the cycling of carbon and other bio-active elements in the ocean. Both decreasing calcifi- cation and enhanced carbon overproduction due to release of extracellular carbohy- drates have the potential to increase the CO2 storage capacity of the ocean. Although the significance of such biological responses to CO2 enrichment becomes increasingly evident, our ability to make reliable predictions of their future developments and to quantify their potential ecological and biogeochemical impacts is still in its infancy.},

abstract = {The mismatch between the 100 and 400??k.y. components of Pleistocene climate and the relative power of those terms from the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit remains a challenge to the Milankovitch hypothesis. Coccolithophores have the potential to respond to parameters of orbital forcing other than insolation, and, as a critical component of the ocean carbon cycle, can act to modify the climate response. The first direct comparison of coccolith fraction Sr/Ca, alkenone abundance and automated coccolithophore counts, shows that CF Sr/Ca is largely driven by changing production of bloom species, with unusually high Sr/Ca ratios. The periods of high CF Sr/Ca and high bloom production mark periods of high global coccolithophore production, which correlate inversely with the low amplitude 100 and higher amplitude 400??k.y. eccentricity orbital frequency. ??? 400??k.y. cycles of coccolithophore bloom production correspond to periods of enhanced carbonate accumulation in some parts of the ocean, deep ocean dissolution in others, positive shifts in global ocean ??13C, and acmes of Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica and Emiliania huxleyi. The link between production of coccolithophore blooms and eccentricity may be due to orbital control of silica leakage from the Southern Ocean, to the orbitally defined inverse correlation between insolation and growing season length and the asymptotic growth response to these parameters, or to changes in nutrient input from weathering. During the Pleistocene, the eccentricity induced coccolithophore acmes have no apparent influence on atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO2) due to the shift towards small bloom coccolithophores, or to coupling with increased diatom productivity, or the ballast effect of the calcium carbonate rain, such that Pleistocene climate has no significant variance at the largest amplitude eccentricity forcing of 400??k.y. Coccolithophores and their influence on the carbon cycle may act as a filter between the incident orbital forcing and resultant climate. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Conspecific ant colonies are often overdispersed, i.e. they are further apart than they would be if they were distributed randomly. This overdispersion might be driven by competition for food resources or nest sites and may result from established colonies preventing incipient colonies from settling too close to them. We investigated another possible mechanism for overdispersion: active nest choice by emigrating colonies. Colonies may be influenced by the presence of conspecifics when they are emigrating from a nest that has become uninhabitable. In the laboratory, we presented Temnothorax albipennis ant colonies with a choice of three new nests, which were equidistant from their old nest site. The new nests were identical except that one was near to an established conspecific colony. The emigrating colonies significantly preferred the new nest site that was furthest from the resident colony. This selection was not just the result of access to the other nests being blocked by aggression from the resident colony; emigrating colonies thus made active choices. Odour cues may influence nest selection: odours left around nest sites by foreign colonies deterred nest occupancy. There was more aggression near the resident colony, but this appeared to be caused by the greater density of resident ants there rather than those ants being more aggressive per capita. We also observed a relatively high proportion of fusions between colonies. Possible reasons for this are considered together with their implications. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

This effect was observed first by comparing ACC from two different species of cystoliths, small calcified bodies formed in the leaves of some plants. The temperature of crystallization to calcite in the silicate-rich cystoliths from M. alba is 100 °C higher than that of the silicate-poor cystoliths from F. microcarpa. The stabilizing effect is confirmed in vitro with synthetic samples differing in their silicate content. With increasing silicate concentration in ACC, the crystallization temperature to calcite also increases.

In latitudinal transects, the highest surface values are found at high latitudes and associates with areas of upwelling. A pronounced upper ocean vertical Sr gradient is attributable to the production of celestite skeletons by surface-dwelling acantharia, coupled to a shallow dissolution cycle. The upper ocean residence time of Sr with respect to celestite cycling is much shorter than its global oceanic residence time. Although the magnitude of seawater Sr/Ca variability is relatively small, it is significant with respect to high-precision paleoceanographic applications. Sr/Ca gradients in the contemporary ocean also complicates evaluating Quaternary changes in seawater Sr/Ca that may have resulted from other processes, such as aragonite recrystallization during sea-level low stands.},

abstract = {There has been considerable discussion about whether reductive cleaning can or should be used when samples are prepared for foraminiferal {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} analyses. The reductive solution causes considerable sample loss through dissolution, and the natural dissolution effect on planktonic foraminiferal {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} raises the question whether the shell chemistry might be affected during cleaning. We conducted a series of experiments to explore the effects of the reductive cleaning step on shell chemistry {\{}(Mg/Ca,{\}} {\{}Na/Ca,{\}} {\{}Sr/Ca,{\}} {\{}Fe/Ca,{\}} {\{}Mn/Ca,{\}} {\{}REE/Ca,{\}} and {\{}U/Ca){\}} of two planktonic foraminiferal species. We then compare these results with natural dissolution in core top specimens from a range of varying natural dissolution intensity. Our results confirm previous experiments by Yu et al. (2007) that the citrate used in the reductive solution can play a larger role in decreasing some {\{}element/Ca{\}} ratios than hydrazine, the reductive agent, at least in samples that are not problematic to clean (i.e., have low {\{}Mn/Ca,{\}} {\{}Fe/Ca,{\}} and {\{}Al/Ca).{\}} Solutions containing varying concentrations of citrate yield lower {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} than those without citrate; however, {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} reaches an asymptotic value following a dilute application of citrate. Other {\{}element/Ca{\}} ratios are also lowered by citrate and tend toward an asymptotic value at increasing strengths of citrate. {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} data from experiments in which the duration of the reductive cleaning step was varied or repeated suggest that the standard reductive cleaning step should yield reproducible results for most elemental ratios. Our experiments suggest that the primary mechanism of dissolution by citrate is unlikely to be preferential removal of Mg from the lattice and also demonstrate that there are differences between natural and laboratory dissolution effects. Given that there are situations in which {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} data are improved by reductive cleaning, we conclude that it is acceptable to reductively clean samples before {\{}Mg/Ca{\}} analysis.},

abstract = {Are the rare earth elements (REEs) in foraminifera a valuable proxy for use in paleoceanographic and climate change studies? In order to investigate this, we attempted a comprehensive study of REEs in planktonic and benthic foraminifera. Several different cleaning protocols were tested. Although the hydroxylamine used to clean all foraminifera in this study removes an unidentified source of REE contamination, it seems to remobilize metal oxides that are otherwise unaffected in flow-through dissolution. The calculated REE distribution coefficients, K
                        D(REE)s, are between 100 and 500 for both planktonic and benthic foraminifera. These K
                        Ds are high compared to other elements in biogenic calcite but can be explained through a general model of element incorporation during foraminiferal calcification. From data taken from eight core tops in the southeast Pacific, we conclude that the REEs in planktonic foraminifera are, indeed, useful as a proxy for upper ocean water mass and mixed layer biogenic productivity. Alternatively, the REEs in benthic foraminifera are useful as a proxy for carbon flux to the sea floor. These proxies should be robust down core unless the sediments have undergone anoxic diagenesis, which stabilizes Fe carbonate thus overprinting the primary REE signature. However, it is clear from REE distributions in foraminiferal tests if anoxic conditions have occurred. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Our results indicate that variations in seawater boron concentration are strongly coupled to variations in chlorinity (and salinity), yielding a mean boron to chlorinity ratio of 0.2414 ± 0.0009 mg kg-1 ‰-1 (boron to salinity ratio = 0.1336 ± 0.0005 mg kg-1 ‰-1). This ratio was surprisingly universal throughout the water column in the three marine basins and across widely different ocean surface regimes, but differs from the generally accepted ratio of 0.232 ± 0.005 mg kg-1 ‰-1 determined by Uppstr{\"{o}}m (1974), which was based on only 20 measurements at four sites in the tropical Pacific Ocean. In converting total alkalinity to carbonate alkalinity (and vice versa) for thermodynamic calculations, the difference between these two ratios leads to a difference of 5 $\mu$mol kg-1 in estimates for ocean surface waters, where the contribution of borate to total alkalinity is typically greatest. We suggest the use of the new boron to chlorinity ratio for predicting seawater boron concentrations using chlorinity (or salinity) data. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Their effects range from increased chemical reactivity to enhanced mechanical properties. Dislocations have been widely studied using traditional techniques such as X-ray diffraction and optical imaging. Recent advances have enabled atomic force microscopy to study single dislocations in two dimensions, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can now visualize strain fields in three dimensions with near-atomic resolution. However, these techniques cannot offer three-dimensional imaging of the formation or movement of dislocations during dynamic processes. Here, we describe how Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI; refs , ) can be used to visualize in three dimensions, the entire network of dislocations present within an individual calcite crystal during repeated growth and dissolution cycles. These investigations demonstrate the potential of BCDI for studying the mechanisms underlying the response of crystalline materials to external stimuli.},

abstract = {From Dr. Martin F. Glaessner:{\^{a}}€”The new facts discovered in Professor Wood's systematic investigation of the shell-wall in calcareous foraminifera are of great interest. Sufficient work has been carried out to show that the distinction between radial and granulate structure in calcareous perforate foraminifera is taxonomically significant. The granulate structure is apparently confined, with a few unexplained exceptions, to Nonion, Virgulina, Cassidulina and closely allied genera, and to the families Chilostomellidae and Ellipsoidinidae. The unravelling of phylogenetic relations and lines of convergence within these groups does not seem to present insuperable difficulties but, as Professor Wood indicates, much work remains to be done. It is noted with regret that the introduction of other matters on which no new observations have been made tends to obscure rather than enhance the importance of the paper under discussion. The repeated statement that " pores can occur in any group " (p. 241 and similarly on p. 245) and that " the hyaline types are more generally perforated than the others " is hardly an adequate expression of the well-known fact that among the calcareous forms all hyaline foraminifera possess perforate chamber-walls while only the embryos of two genera of the Miliolidea are perforate (apart from the tubuli of the aberrant Keramosphaera). It may be true that " there is no need for all hyaline forms to be perforate " (p. 232), but in actual fact they all possess perforate chamber-walls, hence the classificatory importance of this character.

abstract = {Trace elements incorporated in planktonic foraminiferal test carbonate are commonly used as paleoproxies. For instance, Mg/Ca ratios are frequently used for reconstructing sea surface temperature and, together with the foraminiferal stable oxygen isotope ratios, are also used as paleosalinity proxy. Foraminiferal Sr/Ca ratios constitute another example of the application of trace elements in paleostudies since they may reflect the Sr/Ca values of seawater. However, over the past few decades it has been proven that the incorporation of trace elements in foraminiferal calcite is controlled by more than one environmental parameter. To quantify the effect of salinity on Mg and Sr incorporation planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides sacculifer (sensu stricto) were grown in the laboratory under different environmental conditions. Laboratory experiments allowed us to separate a direct salinity effect from a possible independent impact through differences in the calcite saturation state of the seawater ($\Omega$). Although the temperature effect is more important than the salinity effect, a change of 4 salinity units is equivalent to a 1 °C bias on Mg/Ca-based temperatures. This effect of salinity on Mg incorporation is minor. However, when using Mg/Ca-based temperatures in combination with foraminiferal $\delta$18O to calculate salinity, it cannot be neglected. The present study shows salinity as the overriding control on Mg incorporation within the range of $\Omega$ studied ($\Omega$ between 5.25 and 6.50; [CO3
2-] between 218 and 270 $\mu$mol/kg) at a constant temperature of 26 °C. In contrast, $\Omega$ appears to be the main control on foraminiferal Sr incorporation (0.10 mmol/mol per 100 $\mu$mol/kg rise in [CO3
2-]), whereas salinity has a non significant influence on Sr/Ca. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. Abundant mid-trophic pelagic fish often play a central role in marine ecosystems, both as links between zooplankton and top predators and as important fishery targets. In the North Sea, the lesser sandeel occupies this position, being the main prey of many bird, mammal and fish predators and the target of a major industrial fishery. However, since 2003, sandeel landings have decreased by {\textgreater} 50{\%}, and many sandeel-dependent seabirds experienced breeding failures in 2004. 2. Despite the major economic implications, current understanding of the regulation of key constituents of this ecosystem is poor. Sandeel abundance may be regulated 'bottom-up' by food abundance, often thought to be under climatic control, or 'top-down' by natural or fishery predation. We tested predictions from these two hypotheses by combining unique long-term data sets (1973-2003) on seabird breeding productivity from the Isle of May, SE Scotland, and plankton and fish larvae from the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey. We also tested whether seabird breeding productivity was more tightly linked to sandeel biomass or quality (size) of individual fish. 3. The biomass of larval sandeels increased two- to threefold over the study period and was positively associated with proxies of the abundance of their plankton prey. Breeding productivity of four seabirds bringing multiple prey items to their offspring was positively related to sandeel larval biomass with a 1-year lag, indicating dependence on 1-year-old fish, but in one species bringing individual fish it was strongly associated with the size of adult sandeels. 4. These links are consistent with bottom-up ecosystem regulation and, with evidence from previous studies, indicate how climate-driven changes in plankton communities can affect top predators and potentially human fisheries through the dynamics of key mid-trophic fish. However, the failing recruitment to adult sandeel stocks and the exceptionally low seabird breeding productivity in 2004 were not associated with low sandeel larval biomass in 2003, so other mechanisms (e.g. predation, lack of suitable food after metamorphosis) must have been important in this case. Understanding ecosystem regulation is extremely important for predicting the fate of keystone species, such as sandeels, and their predators.},

abstract = {The oceans have absorbed nearly half of the fossil-fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the atmosphere since pre-industrial times, causing a measurable reduction in seawater pH and carbonate saturation. If CO2 emissions continue to rise at current rates, upper-ocean pH will decrease to levels lower than have existed for tens of millions of years and, critically, at a rate of change 100 times greater than at any time over this period. Recent studies have shown effects of ocean acidification on a variety of marine life forms, in particular calcifying organisms. Consequences at the community to ecosystem level, in contrast, are largely unknown. Here we show that dissolved inorganic carbon consumption of a natural plankton community maintained in mesocosm enclosures at initial CO2 partial pressures of 350, 700 and 1,050 microatm increases with rising CO2. The community consumed up to 39{\%} more dissolved inorganic carbon at increased CO2 partial pressures compared to present levels, whereas nutrient uptake remained the same. The stoichiometry of carbon to nitrogen drawdown increased from 6.0 at low CO2 to 8.0 at high CO2, thus exceeding the Redfield carbon:nitrogen ratio of 6.6 in today's ocean. This excess carbon consumption was associated with higher loss of organic carbon from the upper layer of the stratified mesocosms. If applicable to the natural environment, the observed responses have implications for a variety of marine biological and biogeochemical processes, and underscore the importance of biologically driven feedbacks in the ocean to global change.},

abstract = {The role of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for organic carbon partitioning under different CO2 conditions was examined during a mesocosm experiment with the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi. We designed 9 outdoor enclosures (similar to11 m(3)) to simulate CO2 concentrations of estimated 'Year 2100' (similar to710 ppm CO2), 'present' (similar to410 ppm CO2) and 'glacial' (similar to190 ppm CO2) environments, and fertilized these with nitrate and phosphate to favor bloom development. Our results showed fundamentally different TEP and DOC dynamics during the bloom. In all mesocosms, TEP concentration increased after nutrient exhaustion and accumulated steadily until the end of the study. TEP concentration was closely related to the abundance of E. huxleyi and accounted for an increase in POC concentration of 35 2 {\%} after the onset of nutrient limitation. The production of TEP normalized to the cell Abundance of E. huxleyi was highest in the Year 2100 treatment. In contrast, DOC concentration exhibited considerable short-term fluctuations throughout the study. In all mesocosms, DOC was neither related to the abundance of E. huxleyi nor to TEP concentration. A statistically significant effect of the CO2 treatment on DOC concentration was not determined. However, during the course of the bloom, DOC concentration increased in 2 of the 3 Year 2100 mesocosms and in 1 of the present mesocosms, but in none of the glacial mesocosms. It is suggested that the observed differences between TEP and DOC were determined by their different bioavailability and that a rapid response of the microbial food web may have obscured CO2 effects on DOC production by autotrophic cells.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present experimental results demonstrating systematic structural distinctions between biogenic and non-biogenic calcium carbonate. Specifically we show, by high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction on dedicated synchrotron beam lines, that the orthorhombic unit cell of the mollusk-made aragonite is anisotropically distorted as compared with that one of geological aragonite. In all investigated shells, belonging to different classes (bivalve, gastropod, and cephalopod) and taken from different habitat origins (sea, fresh water, and land), the maximum elongation of about 0.1-0.2{\%} was found along the c-axis. The lattice distortions along the a-axis were also of the positive sign (elongation) but lower than those along the c-axis, whereas lattice distortions along the b-axis were always negative (contraction). Supporting experiments, including structural analysis after a bleach procedure, measurements of temperature-dependent lattice relaxation, measurements of the CO2 release at elevated temperatures, signify that the observed structural distinctions are most probably caused by the organic molecules intercalating into the aragonite lattice during biomineralization. Our findings show that in some sense organisms control the atomic structure of the crystals. Deeper understanding of this phenomenon will aid in the development of new approaches to grow biomimetic composites and tailor their properties on a molecular level. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The ratio of boron to calcium (B/Ca) in the carbonate tests of planktic foraminifers has been proposed as a proxy for surface ocean pH or carbonate ion concentration ([CO 32-]), with a possible secondary influence of temperature. In both cultured and wild specimens, B/Ca generally increases with [B(OH) 4-/HCO 3-], consistent with the proxy's theoretical basis. However, close examination of the available data reveals that calibrations using the empirical boron partition coefficient, KD=[B/Ca]calcite/[B(OH)4-/HCO3-]seawater, can be driven by independent relationships between [B(OH) 4-/HCO 3-] and other environmental parameters, not by B/Ca itself. If the influence of B/Ca on a calibration is negligible, it follows that combining that calibration with down-core B/Ca can not yield new information about past ocean conditions. In this study, we evaluate existing calibrations and down-core records with the aim of establishing a framework that allows consistent calibration methods to yield accurate proxy reconstructions from the fossil record. While many issues still need to be addressed, B/Ca does respond to seawater chemistry, and does change across some major climate transitions. Because it may provide insight into major carbon cycle perturbations, we make specific recommendations on how to tackle current uncertainties and develop B/Ca into a more robust proxy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We explore the potential of using the Globorotalia menardii fragmentation index (MFI) and size-normalized foraminifer shell weight (SNSW) as complementary indicators of deep-sea CaCO3 dissolution. MFI has strong correlations with bottom water [CO32−], modeled estimates of percent CaCO3 dissolved, and Mg/Ca in Pulleniatina obliquiloculata in core top samples along a depth transect on the Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) where surface ocean temperature variation is minimal. SNSW of P. obliquiloculata and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei have weak correlations with MFI-based percent dissolved, Mg/Ca in P. obliquiloculata shells and bottom water [CO32−] on the OJP. In core top samples from the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP), SNSW of P. obliquiloculata has moderate to strong correlations with both MFI-based percent CaCO3 dissolved estimates and surface ocean environmental parameters. SNSW of N. dutertrei shells shows a latitudinal distribution in the EEP and a moderately strong correlation with MFI-based percent dissolved estimates when samples from the equatorial part of the region are excluded. Our results suggest that there may potentially be multiple genotypes of N. dutertrei in the EEP which may be reflected in their shell weight. MFI-based percent CaCO3 dissolved estimates have no quantifiable relationship with any surface ocean environmental parameter in the EEP. Thus MFI acts as a reliable quantitative CaCO3 dissolution proxy insensitive to environmental biases within calcification waters of foraminifers.},

abstract = {Adsorption or enrichment of trace elements in the near-surface or interfacial regions of minerals has been documented in systems ranging from low-temperature aqueous environments to magmas. Under static conditions, this surface enrichment results from chemical equilibrium between the host medium of the crystal and the surface layer, which may exhibit diversity or flexibility in the types of atomic sites present. If the crystal is growing, any trace elements bound in the surface layer may be buried and trapped in the newly-formed lattice, resulting in lattice concentrations that deviate substantially from those predicted by equilibrium partitioning between the crystal and its growth medium. The effectiveness of this growth entrapment process depends upon the interplay between the growth rate, V, of the crystal (which can be thought of as the burial rate of surface-enriched element i) and the diffusivity, Di, in the near-surface region of the crystal (which determines how efficiently i can escape to the surface by diffusion). The competition can be quantified in terms of the dimensionless number Vl/Di, (termed the growth P??clet number, Pe), where l is the half-thickness of the surface-enriched layer. Depending upon the degree of surface enrichment, some growth entrapment is possible if Pe {\textgreater} 0.1, and the process is highly efficient if Pe {\textgreater} 10. An assessment of Pe for a wide variety of geological situations suggests that growth entrapment is common in diagenetic and metamorphic environments but limited to slow lattice diffusants in silicic igneous systems. It is probably rare to nonexistent in basaltic systems except at laboratory growth rates.},

abstract = {A key to understanding control over mineral formation in mollusk shells is the microenvironment inside the pre-formed 3-dimensional organic matrix framework where mineral forms. Much of what is known about nacre formation is from observations of the mature tissue. Although these studies have elucidated several important aspects of this process, the structure of the organic matrix and the microenvironment where the crystal nucleates and grows are very difficult to infer from observations of the mature nacre. Here, we use environmental- and cryo-scanning electron microscopy to investigate the organic matrix structure at the onset of mineralization in the nacre of two mollusk species: the bivalves Atrina rigida and Pinctada margaritifera. These two techniques allow the visualization of hydrated biological materials coupled with the preservation of the organic matrix close to physiological conditions. We identified a hydrated gel-like protein phase filling the space between two interlamellar sheets prior to mineral formation. The results are consistent with this phase being the silk-like proteins, and show that mineral formation does not occur in an aqueous solution, but in a hydrated gel-like medium. As the tablets grow, the silk-fibroin is pushed aside and becomes sandwiched between the mineral and the chitin layer. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification from the uptake of anthropogenic carbon is simulated for the industrial period and IPCC SRES emission scenarios A2 and B1 with a global coupled carbon cycle-climate model. Earlier studies identified seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite, a mineral phase of calcium carbonate, as a key variable governing impacts on corals and other shell-forming organisms. Globally in the A2 scenario, water saturated by more than 300{\%}, considered suitable for coral growth, vanishes by 2070 AD (CO2 approximate to 630 ppm), and the ocean volume fraction occupied by saturated water decreases from 42{\%} to 25{\%} over this century. The largest simulated pH changes worldwide occur in Arctic surface waters, where hydrogen ion concentration increases by up to 185{\%} (Delta pH=-0.45). Projected climate change amplifies the decrease in Arctic surface mean saturation and pH by more than 20{\%}, mainly due to freshening and increased carbon uptake in response to sea ice retreat. Modeled saturation compares well with observation-based estimates along an Arctic transect and simulated changes have been corrected for remaining model-data differences in this region. Aragonite undersaturation in Arctic surface waters is projected to occur locally within a decade and to become more widespread as atmospheric CO2 continues to grow. The results imply that surface waters in the Arctic Ocean will become corrosive to aragonite, with potentially large implications for the marine ecosystem, if anthropogenic carbon emissions are not reduced and atmospheric CO2 not kept below 450 ppm.},

abstract = {Although the pH-dependence of boron isotope fractionation between solution and precipitating minerals has been widely used in Earth Sciences, especially for reconstructing ancient seawater pH, the mechanisms by which boron adsorbs on solids or coprecipitates in minerals are still poorly known. Here we have investigated boron isotopic fractionation during its adsorption on goethite ($\alpha$-FeOOH) and birnessite (K0.1MnO2.2,0.9H2O) as a function of solution pH at T = 25 °C and I = 0.1 M. Maximum partition coefficients (Kd) between adsorbed and aqueous boron, equal to 39 and 34 for goethite and birnessite, respectively, are observed at pH = 8-9. B adsorption at the surface of goethite induces its strong pH-dependent isotopic fractionation ranging from $\Delta$ = - 40‰ (10B enrichment on goethite) at pH {\textless} 8, to zero at pH {\textgreater} 10. During adsorption on birnessite at acid and neutral pH, boron isotopic fractionation is lower than during its sorption on goethite ($\Delta$ = - 15‰), decreases ($\alpha$ increases) with increasing pH above pH = 8, and reverses at pH {\textgreater} 9: 11B enrichment (+ 23‰ at pH = 10.8) is observed at birnessite surface. Based on combined infrared (DRIFT) spectroscopic analysis and modeling of B speciation at oxides-solution interfaces, the observed isotopic fractionations can be rationalized by the formation of trigonal and tetrahedral boron inner-sphere complexes on goethite surface, and tetrahedral inner-sphere and trigonal outer-sphere and inner-sphere complexes on birnessite surface. B isotopic fractionation is strongly dependent on the structure of surface complexes formed: the high steric strain induced by the formation of trigonal boron bidendate binuclear complexes at goethite surface leads to a much higher isotopic fractionation (isotopically lighter sorbed boron) than that following the formation of tetrahedral bidendate binuclear complexes. Conversely, the formation at birnessite surface of trigonal complexes, having almost the same isotopic composition than aqueous boric acid, accounts for the heavier isotopic composition of birnessite than goethite boron, both at acid and alkaline pH. These results show that, in nature, 11B enrichment is expected in waters in equilibrium with iron or manganese oxides and that this enrichment is a function of pH that changes boron speciation in solution and at solid surfaces. This is typically the case for soil solution in Fe- and Mn-rich environments and in seawater. In addition, the markedly different isotopic fractionation factor, at the same pH, of boron sorbed on goethite and birnessite (at pH = 8.2, $\alpha$ is equal to 0.967 and 0.986 for goethite and birnessite, respectively) may be used to determine past ocean pH values without requiring knowledge of past isotopic composition. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We found that Globigerinoides saccculifer calcifies over a relatively large range of water depth and that this is apparent in their Mg content.

The magnitude of this shift depends on both the range of temperatures over which the shell calcified and the degree to which it is subsequently dissolved. In spite of this shift the initial relationship between Mg/Ca and {\&}{\#}948;18O, determined by their temperature dependence, is maintained. We conclude that paired measurements of {\&}{\#}948;18O and Mg/Ca can be used for reconstructing {\&}{\#}948;18Owater, though care must be taken to determine where in the water column the reconstruction applies.},

abstract = {In this study, we show that the rate of shell precipitation in the extant planktic foraminifer Orbulina universa is sufficiently rapid that 12h calcification periods in 18O-labeled seawater can be resolved and accurately measured using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for in situ $\delta$18O analyses. Calcifying O. universa held at constant temperature (22°C) were transferred every 12h between ambient seawater ($\delta$18Ow=-0.4‰ VSMOW) and seawater with enriched barium and $\delta$18Ow=+18.6‰ VSMOW, to produce geochemically distinct layers of calcite, separated by calcite precipitated with an ambient geochemical signature. We quantify the position of the Ba-labeled calcite in the shell wall of O. universa via laser ablation ICP-MS depth profiling of trace element ratios, and then measure intrashell $\delta$18Ocalcite in the same shells using SIMS with a 3$\mu$m spot and an average precision of 0.6‰ (±2 SD). Measured $\delta$18Ocalcite values in O. universa shell layers are within ±1.1‰ of predicted $\delta$18Ocalcite values. Elemental and oxygen isotope data show that LA-ICP-MS and SIMS measurements can be cross-correlated within the spatial resolution of the two analytical techniques, and that $\delta$18Ocalcite and elemental tracers appear to be precipitated synchronously with no measurable spatial offsets. These results demonstrate the capability of SIMS to resolve daily growth increments in foraminifer shells, and highlight its potential for paleoceanographic and biomineralization applications on microfossils. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Smaller elevation losses are observed for Crane and Jorum glaciers over a later 5-month period. Two glaciers south of the collapse area, Flask and Leppard, show little change in speed or elevation.

abstract = {About 20years ago, the boron isotopic composition of marine carbonates was proposed as a proxy of ancient seawater pH. Since that time, a large body of studies has used boron isotopes in carbonates to reconstruct seawater paleo-pH and atmospheric paleo-CO2 concentration. To date, however, no systematic investigation of the physicochemical parameters that control boron incorporation in calcite and aragonite (pH, temperature, precipitation rate, etc.) has been performed. To fill this gap, we have experimentally investigated the inorganic co-precipitation of boron with calcite and aragonite at 5 and 25??C in the presence and absence of seed crystals and over the pHNBS range 7.4{\textless}pH{\textless}9.5 in 0.1 or 0.2M NaCl solutions. The boron partition coefficient, DB, between CaCO3 and the fluid is defined as:DB=(XB/XCO3)CaCO3([B]/[CO32-])fluidwith Xi and [i] standing for the mole fraction and molality of the ith species in the solid and fluid, respectively. DB measured in this study are very small (DB???10-3 and ???10-4 for aragonite and calcite, respectively) and exhibit a strong dependence on the solution pH and the calcium carbonate precipitation rate. High field 11B MAS NMR analyses of the precipitated carbonates show that boron in aragonite is mostly in the form of tetragonal B (???85{\%} [IV]B) but that both trigonal and tetragonal B are present in calcite. A significant amount of tetragonal boron in calcite may be in non-lattice (defect) sites, in addition to the structural site. The relative abundance of [III]B and [IV]B in calcite is independent of the parent solution pH but appears to decrease with increasing precipitation rate. The change in boron coordination during its incorporation in calcite and its distribution in, at least, two different sites strongly suggest that the mechanisms controlling B incorporation in this mineral are more complex than for aragonite. It follows that calcite-based calibrations may be less reliable than aragonite calibrations for ocean paleo-pH reconstructions.},

abstract = {An amorphous or nanocrystalline calcium carbonate (ACC) phase with aragonite-like short-range order was found to be a transient precursor phase of calcite precipitation mediated by cyanobacteria of the strain Synechococcus leopoliensis PCC 7942. Using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), different Ca-species such as calcite, aragonite-like CaCO3, and Ca adsorbed on extracellular polymers were discriminated and mapped, together with various organic compounds, at the 30 nm-scale. The nucleation of the amorphous aragonite-like CaCO3 was found to take place within the tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by the cyanobacteria very close to the cell wall. The aragonite-like CaCO3 is a type of ACC since it did not show either X-ray or electron diffraction peaks. The amount of aragonite-like CaCO3 precipitated in the EPS was dependent on the nutrient supply during bacterial growth. Higher nutrient concentrations (both N and P) during the cultivation of the cyanobacteria resulted in higher amounts of precipitation of the aragonite-like CaCO3, whereas the amount of Ca2+ adsorbed per volume of EPS was almost independent of the nutrient level. After the onset of the precipitation of the thermodynamically stable calcite and loss of supersaturation the aragonite-like CaCO3 dissolved whereas Ca2+ remained sorbed to the EPS albeit at lower concentrations. Based on these observations a model describing the temporal and spatial evolution of calcite nucleation on the surface of S. leopoliensis was developed. In another set of STXM experiments the amount of aragonite-like CaCO3 precipitated on the cell surface was found to depend on the culture growth phase: cells in the exponential growth phase adsorbed large amounts of Ca within the EPS and mediated nucleation of ACC, while cells at the stationary/death phase neither adsorbed large amounts of Ca2+ nor mediated the formation of aragonite-like CaCO3. It is suggested that precipitation of an X-ray amorphous CaCO3 layer by cyanobacteria could serve as a protection mechanism against uncontrolled precipitation of a thermodynamically stable phase calcite on their surface. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

We have shown that brine-filled grain boundaries in rock salt can be efficiently well frozen when dimensions are less than about 1 mm. Coupled with an ion beam tool, cryo-SEM allows 3D observation of the well-frozen grain boundaries in large volumes and high resolution. Initial results of brine-filled natural halite grain boundaries show non-faceted crystal–brine interfaces and unexpectedly low dihedral angles at room temperature and pressure.},

abstract = {Abstract Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorescence has been used as a proxy of microphytobenthic biomass after a dark adaptation period of 15 min to stabilise the minimum fluorescence yield (F$\backslash$n$\backslash$no$\backslash$n15). This methodology was investigated for in situ migratory and ex situ engineered non-migratory biofilms, comparing dark adaptation to low (5{\%} ambient) and far-red light treatments over different emersion periods. Far-red and low light reduced potential errors resulting from light history effects, by reversal of non-photochemical quenching after 5 min of treatment, compared to over 10 min required by conventional dark adaptation. An in situ decline of minimum fluorescence yield over 15 min was observed during the dark adaptation for migratory biofilms, but was not observed in the non-migratory biofilms indicating that the major cause of decline was downward vertical migration of cells into the sediment. This pattern occurred in far-red light after 10 min, but not for the low light treatment, indicating that low light maintained the biomass at the surface of the sediment. It is therefore concluded that low light treatment is a better option than conventional dark adaptation for the measurement of minimum fluorescence as a proxy of microphytobenthic biomass.},

Whereas the role of boron in the life cycle of plants is well documented, nothing is known about boron homeostasis and function in animal cells. NaBC1, the mammalian homolog of AtBor1, is a borate transporter. In the absence of borate, NaBC1 conducts Na+ and OH- (H+), while in the presence of borate, NaBC1 functions as an electrogenic, voltage-regulated, Na+-coupled B(OH)4 - transporter. At low concentrations, borate activated the MAPK pathway to stimulate cell growth and proliferation, and at high concentrations, it was toxic. Accordingly, overexpression of NaBC1 shifted both effects of borate to the left, whereas knockdown of NaBC1 halted cell growth and proliferation. These findings may reveal a previously unrecognized role for NaBC1 in borate homeostasis and open the way to better understanding of the many presumed physiological roles of borate in animals.},

abstract = {Corals open an exceptional window into many phenomena of geological, geochemical, climatic, and paleontological interest. From the Paleozoic to the present, corals provide some of the finest high-resolution archives of marine conditions. Corals are likewise exceptional for chronometric purposes, and even the terrestrial 14C timescale has now been calibrated against coral 230Th/234U. Corals also represent a testing ground for basic ideas about mineralogy and geochemistry. The shapes, sizes, and organization of skeletal crystals have been attributed to factors as diverse as mineral supersaturation levels and organic mediation of crystal growth. The coupling between calcification and photosynthesis in symbiotic corals is likewise attributed to everything from photosynthetic alkalinization of the water, to efforts by the coral to prevent photosynthetic alkalinization. Corals also leave a significant geochemical imprint on the oceans. Their aragonite skeletons accept about 10 times more strontium than does calcite, hence the proportion of marine aragonite precipitation affects the oceanic chemical balance. Biological carbonates represent the biosphere's largest carbon reservoir, hence calcareous organisms affect the ocean's pH, CO2 content, and ultimately global temperatures through the greenhouse gas connection. Finally, corals present some geochemical puzzles for ecology and conservation. How do symbiotic corals obtain nutrients in some of the most nutrient deficient parts of the planet? Are global geochemical changes partially responsible for the widespread declines in coral reefs during recent decades? We will address many of these issues, but will concentrate on coral skeletal structure and calcification mechanism. These topics bear most directly on the biomineralization process and generally affect the choice of skeletal materials and analytical techniques used in geochemical investigations.},

abstract = {Bone and dentin biomineralization are well-regulated processes mediated by extracellular matrix proteins. It is widely believed that specific matrix proteins in these tissues modulate nucleation of apatite nanoparticles and their growth into micrometer-sized crystals via molecular recognition at the protein-mineral interface. However, this assumption has been supported only circumstantially, and the exact mechanism remains unknown. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) is an acidic matrix protein, present in the mineralized matrix of bone and dentin. In this study, we have demonstrated using synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering that DMP1 in solution can undergo oligomerization and temporarily stabilize the newly formed calcium phosphate nanoparticle precursors by sequestering them and preventing their further aggregation and precipitation. The solution structure represents the first low-resolution structural information for DMP1. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies further confirmed that the nascent calcium phosphate nuclei formed in solution were assembled into ordered protein-mineral complexes with the aid of oligomerized DMP1, recombinant and native. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which DMP1 might facilitate initiation of mineral nucleation at specific sites during bone and dentin mineralization and prevent spontaneous calcium phosphate precipitation in areas in which mineralization is not desirable.},

Planktonic foraminifera of two tropical Atlantic deep-sea sediment cores show the strict relation between micro-scale euhydral crystallites of inorganic precipitates, higher oxygen isotope values and Mg/Ca ratios, and lower Sr/Ca ratios than expected for their pelagic environment in the time interval of similar to 100 000-550 000 calendar years before present. Laser ablation Mg/Ca (Sr/Ca) of crystallite-bearing foraminiferal chamber walls revealed 4-6 times elevated (2-3 times depleted) ratios, when ablating the diagenetic overgrowth. Crystalline overgrowth in proportion of 10-20{\%} are estimated to cause the observed geochemical alteration. The extent of foraminiferal Mg/Ca alteration, moreover, seems to be controlled by the composition of the bulk sediment, especially the content of high-magnesium calcite. Anomalous ratios of {\textgreater} 6 mmol/mol only occur, when high-magnesium calcite has dissolved within the sediment. The older parts (back to similar to 800 kyrs) of the records are characterized by similar trends of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca. We discuss possible scenarios to accommodate the obtained geochemical information.},

abstract = {PDFgetX3 is a new software application for converting X-ray powder diffraction data to an atomic pair distribution function (PDF). PDFgetX3 has been designed for ease of use, speed and automated operation. The software can readily process hundreds of X-ray patterns within a few seconds and is thus useful for high-throughput PDF studies that measure numerous data sets as a function of time, temperature or other environmental parameters. In comparison to the preceding programs, PDFgetX3 requires fewer inputs and less user experience and it can be readily adopted by novice users. The live-plotting interactive feature allows the user to assess the effects of calculation parameters and select their optimum values. PDFgetX3 uses an ad hoc data correction method, where the slowly changing structure-independent signal is filtered out to obtain coherent X-ray intensities that contain structure information. The output from PDFgetX3 has been verified by processing experimental PDFs from inorganic, organic and nanosized samples and comparing them with their counterparts from a previous established software. In spite of the different algorithm, the obtained PDFs were nearly identical and yielded highly similar results when used in structure refinement. PDFgetX3 is written in the Python language and features a well documented reusable code base. The software can be used either as a standalone application or as a library of PDF processing functions that can be called from other Python scripts. The software is free for open academic research but requires paid license for commercial use.},

Although recognized as important in previous studies, the meroplankton component and, in particular, the cirripedes have been largely ignored, though they rank second to the Copepoda in abundance. In order to estimate the contribution of barnacle larvae to the pelagic community, 42 quantitative zooplankton samples were collected from a fixed station within the estuary during a period of 19 months (from 12 January 2001 until 16 July 2002). As expected, barnacles were the second most abundant group averaging 13{\%} of the total population, and accounting for up to 60{\%} on some occasions. Eight barnacle species were identified: Elminius modestus, Balanus improvisus, Balanus crenatus, Semibalanus balanoides, Verruca stroemia, Chthamalus stellatus, Sacculina carcini, and Peltogaster paguri. Of these E. modestus was the most abundant and frequent, dominating the Cirripedia fraction throughout the year, but being outnumbered by B. crenatus from February to May. Secondary production was calculated for E. modestus and mean daily rates of 0.077mgCm -3d-1 (28.08mgCm-3yr-1) were found. ?? 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Most available evidence is observational or correlative, with intrinsic risks of confounded causality. This paper reviews and categorises the available evidence, concluding that competition between corals and algae probably is widespread on coral reefs, but also that the interaction varies considerably. Widespread replacement of corals by algae may often indicate coral mortality due to external disturbances. rather than competitive overgrowth, but may lead to competitive inhibition of coral recruitment. with consequences for reef recovery. We list eight specific processes by which corals and algae may affect each other, and suggest life history properties that will influence which of these interactions are possible. We propose a matrix for algal effects on corals, which lists the subset of processes possible for each combination of coral life form and algal functional group.

abstract = {The flux of organic material sinking to depth is a major control on the inventory of carbon in the ocean. To first order, the oceanic system is at equilibrium such that what goes down must come up. Because the export flux is difficult to measure directly, it is routinely estimated indirectly by quantifying the amount of phytoplankton growth, or primary production, fuelled by the upward flux of nitrate. To do so it is necessary to take into account other sources of biologically available nitrogen. However, the generation of nitrate by nitrification in surface waters has only recently received attention. Here we perform the first synthesis of open-ocean measurements of the specific rate of surface nitrification and use these to configure a global biogeochemical model to quantify the global role of nitrification. We show that for much of the world ocean a substantial fraction of the nitrate taken up is generated through recent nitrification near the surface. At the global scale, nitrification accounts for about half of the nitrate consumed by growing phytoplankton. A consequence is that many previous attempts to quantify marine carbon export, particularly those based on inappropriate use of the f-ratio (a measure of the efficiency of the 'biological pump'), are significant overestimates.},

abstract = {We investigated the carbon acquisition of three marine microalgae, Skeletonema costatum, Phaeocystis globosa, and Emiliania huxleyi in response to different light regimes. Rates of photosynthetic O-2 evolution and CO2 and HCO3- uptake were measured by membrane inlet mass spectrometry in cells acclimated to cycles of 16: 8 light: dark (LD; h: h) and 12: 12 LD and were compared with those obtained under continuous light. In addition, cellular leakage was estimated for different photoperiods and ambient CO2 concentrations during growth. Maximum rates of photosynthesis more or less doubled under LD cycles compared with continuous light. In S. costatum and E. huxleyi, a remarkably higher contribution of HCO3- to the overall carbon uptake was observed under LD cycles. In contrast, P. globosa did not change its CO2 : HCO3- uptake ratio in response to daylength. Half saturation concentrations (K-1/2) for O-2 evolution and inorganic carbon (Ci) uptake were also influenced by the photoperiod. Under LD cycles K-1/2 values for photosynthesis in S. costatum and P. globosa were similar or higher compared with continuous light, whereas they were much lower in E. huxleyi. With the exception of CO2 uptake in E. huxleyi and P. globosa, affinities for Ci decreased under the LD cycles. Cellular leakage was highest for E. huxleyi and lowest for S. costatum and generally decreased with increasing CO2 concentration. Although this study confirms species-specific differences in the CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), the effect of daylength on CO2 and HCO3- uptake has hitherto not been described. We put forward the idea that variations in light condition influence the cellular carbon demand, thereby imposing a stronger control on CCM regulation than the naturally occurring changes in CO2 supply},

abstract = {The purple-tipped sea urchin, Psammechinus miliaris, was exposed to artificially acidified seawater treatments (pHw 6.16, 6.63 or 7.44) over a period of 8 days. Urchin mortality of 100{\%} was observed at pHw 6.16 after 7 days and coincided with a pronounced hypercapnia in the coelomic fluid producing an irrecoverable acidosis. Coelomic fluid acid-base measures showed that an accumulation of CO2 and a significant reduction in pH occurred in all treatments compared with controls. Bicarbonate buffering was employed in each case, reducing the resultant acidosis, but compensation was incomplete even under moderate environmental hypercapnia. Significant test dissolution was inferred from observable increases in the Mg2+ concentration of the coelomic fluid under all pH treatments. We show that a chronic reduction of surface water pH to below 7.5 would be severely detrimental to the acid-base balance of this predominantly intertidal species; despite its ability to tolerate fluctuations in pCO2 and pH in the rock pool environment. The absence of respiratory pigment (or any substantial protein in the coelomic fluid), a poor capacity for ionic regulation and dependency on a magnesium calcite test, make echinoids particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic acidification. Geological sequestration leaks may result in dramatic localised pH reductions, e.g. pH 5.8.

Our study involved long-term monitoring of bottom current speeds and temperatures coupled with 'snap-shot' surveys of the concentrations of hydrothermal shrimp, manganese and particulate plumes occupying the water column enclosed by the axial valley. These data are combined with the calculated volume transport rates for the segment and the results compared with the heat and manganese flux from the Broken Spur vent field, located in the center of the segment. Our current meter data show that the basin-like bathymetry acts to restrict and control flow of water. Warm and shallow water, exported from the segment, is replaced by colder and deeper water. Water column profiles showed an increase in temperature of the water within the 'Broken Spur' segment, compared with background stations located outside the ridge axis. The average refresh rate for the water column enclosed by the segment was found to be about 262 days. From these data, we calculate that the segment-wide flux of juvenile shrimp is {\~{}}20 x 10
                        6 individuals per year. We show that the flux of manganese (exported at a rate of 5-6 mol/s) is matched by input from high-temperature effluent discharge at the Broken Spur vent field. We also calculate that the minimum average heat flux exported from the segment is about 275 MW. Of this, more than 90{\%} is pervasively dissipated throughout the segment floor by conductively heated sea water, or simple thermal conduction, that carries little or no manganese to the water column. The remaining 10{\%} or less of the heat flux results from localized, manganese-rich, high-temperature hydrothermal venting.},

Robust autogenous healing has been observed in laboratory conditions only when the crack width is less than roughly 150 micrometers, and possibly lower under field conditions; the micromechanical design of Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC), a class of fiber-reinforced cement-based composites, allows for such crack width control. Electron- and optical microscopies, complimented by Raman spectroscopy and EDS techniques, are used to show that the healing products are a mixture of low-Ca C-S-H and calcite, and that the surfaces of the fibers exposed by cracking act as nucleation sites for healing. Nanoindentation is used to demonstrate that the modulus of the healing product is roughly equivalent to that of hydrated cementitious matrix. Finally, 3D X-ray microtomography has been used to investigate the microstructure of cracked ECC.},

Boron uptake by a particular species should, therefore, be primarily determined by the B concentration in the soil solution and the rate of water uptake by the plant. This simple explanation of B uptake, however, does not adequately explain field observations where dramatic differences in B concentrations are observed between species, even when these species are grown under similar environmental conditions. The apparent contradiction between experimental results and in field observations, suggests, that B uptake is determined by factors that are as yet unknown. In the following, we discuss experimental and field observations as they relate to B uptake and discuss the mechanisms that may be involved in determining B uptake in diverse species.

These blooms may contribute to declines in seagrasses and non-blooming macroalgal beds, increasing hypoxia, and reductions in the diversity of benthic invertebrates. However, they may also provide other marine organisms with food and habitat, increase secondary production, and reduce eutrophication. The objective of this systematic review will be to quantify the positive and negative impacts of anthropogenically induced macroalgal blooms in order to determine their effects on ecosystem structure and functioning, and to identify factors that cause their effects to vary.},

abstract = {Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is a metastable phase often observed during low temperature inorganic synthesis and biomineralization. ACC transforms with aging or heating into a less hydrated form, and with time crystallizes to calcite or aragonite. The energetics of transformation and crystallization of synthetic and biogenic (extracted from California purple sea urchin larval spicules, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) ACC were studied using isothermal acid solution calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. Transformation and crystallization of ACC can follow an energetically downhill sequence: more metastable hydrated ACC → less metastable hydrated ACC ⇒ anhydrous ACC ∼ biogenic anhydrous ACC ⇒ vaterite → aragonite → calcite. In a given reaction sequence, not all these phases need to occur. The transformations involve a series of ordering, dehydration, and crystallization processes, each lowering the enthalpy (and free energy) of the system, with crystallization of the dehydrated amorphous material lowering the enthalpy the most. ACC is much more metastable with respect to calcite than the crystalline polymorphs vaterite or aragonite. The anhydrous ACC is less metastable than the hydrated, implying that the structural reorganization during dehydration is exothermic and irreversible. Dehydrated synthetic and anhydrous biogenic ACC are similar in enthalpy. The transformation sequence observed in biomineralization could be mainly energetically driven; the first phase deposited is hydrated ACC, which then converts to anhydrous ACC, and finally crystallizes to calcite. The initial formation of ACC may be a first step in the precipitation of calcite under a wide variety of conditions, including geological CO(2) sequestration.},

abstract = {The evolutionary succession of marine photoautotrophs began with the origin of photosynthesis in the Archean Eon, perhaps as early as 3.8 billion years ago. Since that time, Earth's atmosphere, continents, and oceans have undergone substantial cyclic and secular physical, chemical, and biological changes that selected for different phytoplankton taxa. Early in the history of eukaryotic algae, between 1.6 and 1.2 billion years ago, an evolutionary schism gave rise to "green" (chlorophyll b-containing) and "red" (chlorophyll c-containing) plastid groups. Members of the "green" plastid line were important constituents of Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic oceans, and, ultimately, one green clade colonized land. By the mid-Mesozoic, the green line had become ecologically less important in the oceans. In its place, three groups of chlorophyll c-containing eukaryotes, the dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms, began evolutionary trajectories that have culminated in ecological dominance in the contemporary oceans. Breakup of the supercontinent Pangea, continental shelf flooding, and changes in ocean redox chemistry may all have contributed to this evolutionary transition. At the same time, the evolution of these modem eukaryotic taxa has influenced both the structure of marine food webs and global biogeochemical cycles.},

abstract = {A critical link missing from our understanding of the nursery role of specific marine habitats is the evidence of connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats. This paper reviews and evaluates evidence of, and spatial scales for, movements from juvenile to adult habitats and it summarises the methods used to study movements. Examples include many fish families but few invertebrate taxa, and most are species of economic importance for USA and Australia. The types of juvenile habitat range from the entire estuary or shallow open coastal waters to specific habitats within estuaries or coastal waters; in some cases juvenile habitats include habitats not traditionally regarded as nursery areas (e.g. the surf zone). The duration of time spent in juvenile habitats averages 13 mo (range 8 d to 5 yr). The majority of organisms move distances of kilometres to hundreds of kilometres from juvenile to adult habitats, although the scale of movements ranged from metres to thousands of kilometres. Changes in abundance among separate habitats and the progression of size classes among separate habitats are the main methods used to infer movement and habitat connectivity. Spatial partitioning of stages of maturity, natural parasites, and a variety of artificial tagging methods have also been used. The latter will become more useful with continued developments in the miniaturisation of artificial tags. More recent studies have used natural tags (e.g. trace elements and stable isotopes) and these methods show great promise for determining movements from juvenile to adult habitats. Few studies provide good evidence for movement from specific juvenile habitats to adult habitats. Future studies need to focus on this movement to supplement data on density, growth and survival of organisms in putative nursery habitats. Such information will allow management and conservation efforts to focus on those habitats that make the greatest contribution to adult populations.},

abstract = {A numerical model is presented for the transport and exchange of oxygen isotopes in an idealized two-layer oceanic crust (basalt-carbonate) that is saturated with a non-advecting pore fluid open to the overlying ocean. The model allows for time-varying sedimentation rate, porosity, chemical diffusivity, and temperature-dependent 18O fractionation factors. Reaction is modeled as solution-precipitation of calcite in the carbonate sediment and as modified solution-precipitation (basalt dissolves, smectite precipitates) in the basalt layer. Generic models, using input parameters that are typical of those measured in DSDP-ODP cores, and constant sedimentation rates, illustrate the behavior of the system sufficiently well to allow first-order effects to be discerned that have important implications for paleotemperature and ocean floor weathering studies. The solution-precipitation reactions allow oxygen to be exchanged between the low-??18O basalt layer and the high-??18O carbonate sediment through the medium of the pore fluids. This results in ??18O increasing upwards in the basalt and decreasing downwards in the sediment. Pore fluid ??18O values decrease with depth from zero to values of -1 to -3??? at the basalt-sediment interface, and to values of -7 to -15??? within the basalt. Because reaction rates are slow relative to diffusion in the pore fluid, high-frequency ??18O variations in the solid are preserved indefinitely, but the amplitude of the variations decreases as e-Rt where mR is the reaction rate (fraction reacted per unit time). The results suggest that the diagenetic shifts of the ??18O values of benthic and high-latitude planktonic foraminifera samples younger than Oligocene age are typically negligible. For samples older than 50 Ma, diagenetic effects are typically significant, and generally cause estimates of bottom and high-latitude surface ocean temperatures in the Cretaceous and early Tertiary to be too high. On the other hand, the model suggests that diagenesis will shift the ??18O values of low-latitude planktonic foraminifera to higher values, and that paleotemperature estimates of low-latitude surface waters, particularly in the Eocene and Oligocene, may be too low. Using a synthetic ??18O record for DSDP Site 167, we demonstrate how numerical models can be used to correct specific measured records for diagenesis. This approach could provide a means of extracting paleotemperature information from heavily altered Late Cretaceous and older samples, and for quantifying the subtle effects of diagenesis on the ??18O record at all sites. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Geochemical observations indicate that planktic foraminifer test Mg/Ca is heterogeneous in many species, thereby challenging its use as a paleotemperature proxy for paleoceanographic reconstructions. We present Mg/Ca and Ba/Ca data collected by laser ablation ICP-MS from the shells of Orbulina universa cultured in controlled laboratory experiments. Test calcite was labeled with Ba-spiked seawater for 12 h day or night calcification periods to quantify the timing of intratest Mg-banding across multiple diurnal cycles. Results demonstrate that high Mg bands are precipitated during the night whereas low Mg bands are precipitated during the day. Data obtained from specimens growing at 20 ??C and 25 ??C show that Mg/Ca ratios in both high and low Mg bands increase with temperature, and average test Mg/Ca ratios are in excellent agreement with previously published empirical calibrations based on bulk solution ICP-MS analyses. In general, Mg band concentrations decrease with increasing pH and/or [CO2-
3] but this effect decreases as experimental temperatures increase from 20 ??C to 25 ??C. We suggest that mitochondrial uptake of Mg2+ from the thin calcifying fluid beneath streaming rhizopodial filaments may provide the primary locus for Mg2+ removal during test calcification, and that diurnal variations in either mitochondrial density or activity produce Mg banding. These results demonstrate that Mg banding is an inherent component of test biomineralization in O. universa and show that the Mg/Ca paleothermometer remains a fundamental tool for reconstructing past ocean temperatures from fossil foraminifers.},

In order to determine the robustness of our results, we employ three different variants of the ocean general circulation model (OGCM) required to transport and mix the nutrients and alkalinity into the upper ocean. In our standard model, the global export of CaCO3 is diagnosed as 1.1 PgC yr1 (range of sensitivity cases 0.8 to 1.2 PgC yr1) and that of opal as 180 Tmol Si yr1 (range 160 to 180 Tmol Si yr1). CaCO3 export is found to have three maxima at approximately 40S, the equator, and around 40N. In contrast, the opal export is dominated by the Southern Ocean with a single maximum at around 60S. The molar export ratio of inorganic to organic carbon is diagnosed in our standard model to be about 0.09 (range 0.07 to 0.10) and found to be remarkably uniform spatially. The molar export ratio of opal to organic nitrogen varies substantially from values around 2 to 3 in the Southern Ocean south of 45S to values below 0.5 throughout most of the rest of the ocean, except for the North Pacific. Irrespective of which OGCM is used, large phytoplankton dominate the export of POC, with diatoms alone accounting for 40{\%} of this export, while the contribution of coccolithophorids is only about 10{\%}. Small phytoplankton dominate net primary production (NPP) with a fraction of 70{\%}. Diatoms and coccolithophorids account for about 15{\%} and less than 2{\%} of NPP, respectively. These diagnosed contributions of the main phytoplankton functional groups to NPP are also robust across all OGCMs investigated. Correlation and regression analyses reveal that the variations in the relative contributions of diatoms and coccolithophorids to NPP can be predicted reasonably well on the basis of a few key parameters},

abstract = {Mg-chelatase catalyses the insertion of Mg into protoporphyrin IX (Proto). This seemingly simple reaction also is potentially one of the most interesting and crucial steps in the (bacterio)chlorophyll (Bchl/Chl)-synthesis pathway, owing to its position at the branch-point between haem and Bchl/Chl synthesis. Up until the level of Proto, haem and Bchl/Chl synthesis share a common pathway. However, at the point of metal-ion insertion there are two choices: Mg2+ insertion to make Bchl/Chl (catalysed by Mg-chelatase) or Fe2+ insertion to make haem (catalysed by ferrochelatase). Thus the relative activities of Mg-chelatase and ferrochelatase must be regulated with respect to the organism's requirements for these end products. How is this regulation achieved? For Mg-chelatase, the recent design of an in vitro assay combined with the identification of Bchl-biosynthetic enzyme genes has now made it possible to address this question. In all photosynthetic organisms studied to date, Mg-chelatase is a three-component enzyme, and in several species these proteins have been cloned and expressed in an active form. The reaction takes place in two steps, with an ATP-dependent activation followed by an ATP-dependent chelation step. The activation step may be the key to regulation, although variations in subunit levels during diurnal growth may also play a role in determining the flux through the Bchl/Chl and haem branches of the pathway.},

abstract = {1. Declines in abundance and diversity of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in Europe have been linked to agricultural intensification and the resulting loss of suitable foraging and nesting habitats. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a new scheme in England offering the opportunity to restore habitats of value for these important pollinators to agricultural land. Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species assemblage. 2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years using a multisite experiment. 3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate naturally or managed as conservation headlands. 4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees, including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and sexes in their responses to field margin management over time. 5. A diverse mixture of native wildflowers attracted more of the shorter-tongued Bombus spp. and provided greater continuity of forage resources, especially early in the season. Allowing Cirsium spp. to flower on such margins also increased their attractiveness to male bumble bees. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the legume-based 'pollen and nectar flower mix', as prescribed under Entry Level Stewardship in England, can quickly provide a highly attractive forage resource for bumble bees, but that issues of seasonal flowering phenology and longevity of the mixture need to be addressed. Establishment of 'floristically enhanced margins' under Higher Level Stewardship will be important to provide diverse perennial communities of forage plants and to support a greater range of Bombus spp. and other pollinators. The population-level responses of bumble bees to introduced seed mixtures and other agri-environment options require further study in order to maximize the benefits of such schemes in intensively farmed landscapes.},

In the past 25 years the study of these mass extinction events has increased dramatically, with most focus being on the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) event, although study of the end-Permian event (in terms of research output) is likely to surpass that of the K-T in the next few years. Many aspects of these events are still debated and there is no common cause or single set of climatic or environmental changes common to these five events, although all are associated with evidence for climatic change. The supposed extinction-causing environmental changes resulting from extraterrestrial impact are, at best, equivocal and are unlikely to have been of sufficient intensity or geographic extent to cause global extinction. The environmental consequences of rapid global warming (such as ocean stagnation, reduced upwelling and loss of surface productivity) are considered to have been particularly detrimental to the biosphere in the geological past. The first phase of the Late Ordovician event is clearly linked to rapid global cooling. Palaeoecological studies have demonstrated that feeding mechanism is a key trait that enhances survival chances, with selective detritivores and omnivores usually faring better than suspension feeders or grazers. This indicates that primary productivity collapse and consequent lack of food supply is a key proximate cause of extinction. Typically, this low productivity state continues for several hundred thousand years and is associated with widespread stunting of marine organisms (the Lilliput effect) and low-biomass ecosystems. Rebuilding of the marine ecosystem is an important process, and a number of models have been constructed that can be used for comparative purposes (e.g., to understand variation in rates of recovery between events, or between different regions within the same event). Understanding the extinction and recovery processes in ancient events, especially those associated with global warming, may be crucial to managing the present biodiversity crisis. Yet, as many aspects of these mass extinction events remain little understood, there is still much work to do. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mg/Ca ratios of planktonic foraminiferal tests are important tools for reconstructing past ocean temperatures at different levels of the upper water column. Yet numerous studies suggest a significant influence of calcite dissolution on Mg/Ca ratios lowering their initial signal recorded within a planktonic foraminiferal habitat. To determine the effect of dissolution, this study presents Mg/Ca ratios of eight planktonic foraminiferal species from the South China Sea sediment surface. Continuously decreasing with increasing water depth, the Mg/Ca ratios also decrease with calcite-saturation states close to and below saturation (bottom water inline image) but are stable in well calcite-supersaturated bottom waters ({\textgreater}40 $\mu$mol kg−1). This preservation pattern compares well with examples of Mg/Ca dissolution from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and is independent of the foraminiferal species. Merging a global data set by separate normalization of 79 Mg/Ca data sets from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, which removes thermal differences between the ocean regions and foraminiferal species, enabled us to quantify a global decrease in planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios of 0.054 ±0.019 $\mu$mol mol−1 per $\mu$mol kg−1 below a critical threshold for dissolution of 21.3 ±6.6 $\mu$mol kg−1. The absolute decline in Mg/Ca ratios, which is similar for all species, affects temperature estimates from (sub-)thermocline species more strongly than those from shallow dwellers. The water depth of this critical threshold in the global oceans shoals from {\textgreater}3.5 km in the North Atlantic to {\textless}0.5 km in the North Pacific based on calculations of the global calcite-saturation state from 6321 hydrographic stations. Above this critical threshold Mg/Ca ratios are well preserved, and paleotemperature estimates are broadly unaffected by dissolution.},

@article{Edwards2005,
abstract = {A simplified climate model is presented which includes a fully 3-D, frictional geostrophic (FG) ocean component but retains an integration efficiency considerably greater than extant climate models with 3-D, primitive-equation ocean representations (20 kyears of integration can be completed in about a day on a PC). The model also includes an Energy and Moisture Balance atmosphere and a dynamic and thermodynamic sea-ice model. Using a semi-random ensemble of 1,000 simulations, we address both the inverse problem of parameter estimation, and the direct problem of quantifying the uncertainty due to mixing and transport parameters. Our results represent a first attempt at tuning a 3-D climate model by a strictly defined procedure, which nevertheless considers the whole of the appropriate parameter space. Model estimates of meridional overturning and Atlantic heat transport are well reproduced, while errors are reduced only moderately by a doubling of resolution. Model parameters are only weakly constrained by data, while strong correlations between mean error and parameter values are mostly found to be an artefact of single-parameter studies, not indicative of global model behaviour. Single-parameter sensitivity studies can therefore be misleading. Given a single, illustrative scenario of CO2 increase and fixing the polynomial coefficients governing the extremely simple radiation parameterisation, the spread of model predictions for global mean warming due solely to the transport parameters is around one degree after 100 years forcing, although in a typical 4,000-year ensemble-member simulation, the peak rate of warming in the deep Pacific occurs 400 years after the onset of the forcing. The corresponding uncertainty in Atlantic overturning after 100 years is around 5 Sv, with a small, but non-negligible, probability of a collapse in the long term.},

abstract = {[1] The end-Triassic mass extinctions represent one of the five most severe biotic crises in Earth history, yet remain one of the most enigmatic. Ongoing debate concerns the environmental effects of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) eruptions and their linkage with the mass extinction event across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. There is conflicting paleo-evidence for changes in atmospheric pCO(2) during the extrusion of the CAMP basalts. Studies on sediments from European and Pacific localities have, however, identified a substantial negative isotopic anomaly (up to -3.5parts per thousand) across the TR-J boundary, providing an important indicator of changes in the operation of the ancient global carbon cycle. We sought to explain the paleo-evidence by utilizing a carbon cycle model for the "hothouse'' world of the end-Triassic that emphasizes the chemical weathering of silicate and carbonate rocks and the ocean carbonate chemistry. We find that volcanic CO2 outgassing fails to fully account for either a sufficient rise in atmospheric pCO(2) (indicated by the stomata of fossil leaves) or the sedimentary isotopic fingerprint. Instead, the scenario that best fits all of the geologic evidence is a positive feedback loop in which warming, due to a buildup of volcanically derived CO2, triggers destabilization of seafloor methane hydrates and the catastrophic release of CH4 [Palfy et al., 2001]. We calculate that this carbon cycle perturbation was huge, involving the release of similar to8000-9000 Gt C as CO2 during the CAMP basaltic eruptions and similar to5000 Gt C as CH4. In the model the initial isotopic excursion is assumed to take place over similar to70 kyr, while complete reequilibration of the ocean-atmosphere system with respect to CO2 is accomplished over 700-1000 kyr. Our results thus provide a preliminary theoretical explanation for the bioevents, estimated pCO(2) changes, and isotopic excursions observed in marine and continental sediments at this time.},

Here we offer improved publicly available Fortran 95 routines to model the ocean carbonate system (mocsy 2.0). Both codes take as input dissolved inorganic carbon {\textless}i{\textgreater}C{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}T{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and total alkalinity {\textless}i{\textgreater}A{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}T{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, tracers that are conservative with respect to mixing and changes in temperature and salinity. Both use the same thermodynamic equilibria to compute surface-ocean {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}/i{\textgreater}CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and simulate air–sea CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} fluxes, but mocsy 2.0 uses a faster and safer algorithm (SolveSAPHE) to solve the alkalinity-pH equation, applicable even under extreme conditions. The OCMIP code computes only surface {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}/i{\textgreater}CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, while mocsy computes all other carbonate system variables throughout the water column. It also avoids three common model approximations: that density is constant, that modeled potential temperature is equal to in situ temperature, and that depth is equal to pressure. Errors from these approximations grow with depth, e.g., reaching 3{\%} or more for {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}/i{\textgreater}CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, and {\&}Omega;{\textless}sub{\textgreater}A{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} at 5000 m. The mocsy package uses the equilibrium constants recommended for best practices. It also offers two new options: (1) a recently reassessed total boron concentration B{\textless}sub{\textgreater}T{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} that is 4{\%} larger and (2) new {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} formulations designed to include low-salinity waters. Although these options enhance surface {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}/i{\textgreater}CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} by up to 7 {\&}mu;atm, individually, they should be avoided until (1) best-practice equations for {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} are reevaluated with the new B{\textless}sub{\textgreater}T{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and (2) formulations of {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} for low salinities are adjusted to be consistent among pH scales. The common modeling practice of neglecting alkalinity contributions from inorganic P and Si leads to substantial biases that could easily be avoided. With standard options for best practices, mocsy agrees with results from the CO2SYS package within 0.005{\%} for the three inorganic carbon species (concentrations differ by less than 0.01 {\&}mu;mol kg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}).

abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi are increasingly recognized as important agents of mineral weathering and soil development, with far-reaching impacts on biogeochemical cycles. Because EcM fungi live in a symbiotic relationship with trees and in close contact with bacteria and archaea, it is difficult to distinguish between the weathering effects of the fungus, host tree and other micro-organisms. Here, we quantified mineral weathering by the fungus Paxillus involutus, growing in symbiosis with Pinus sylvestris under sterile conditions. The mycorrhizal trees were grown in specially designed sterile microcosms in which the supply of soluble phosphorus (P) in the bulk media was varied and grains of the calcium phosphate mineral apatite mixed with quartz, or quartz alone, were provided in plastic wells that were only accessed by their fungal partner. Under P limitation, pulse labelling of plants with 14CO2 revealed plant-to-fungus allocation of photosynthates, with 17 times more 14C transferred into the apatite wells compared with wells with only quartz. Fungal colonization increased the release of P from apatite by almost a factor of three, from 7.5 (±1.1) × 10−10 mol m−2 s−1 to 2.2 (±0.52) × 10−9 mol m−2 s−1. On increasing the P supply in the microcosms from no added P, through apatite alone, to both apatite and orthophosphate, the proportion of biomass in roots progressively increased at the expense of the fungus. These three observations, (i) proportionately more plant energy investment in the fungal partner under P limitation, (ii) preferential fungal transport of photosynthate-derived carbon towards patches of apatite grains and (iii) fungal enhancement of weathering rate, reveal the tightly coupled plant–fungal interactions underpinning enhanced EcM weathering of apatite and its utilization as P source.},

Data sets for this purpose contain data from spatially extensive networks of sites. The data are either directly comparable to model output or readily interpretable in terms of modelled climate variables. Data sets must contain sufficient documentation to distinguish between raw (primary) and interpreted (secondary, tertiary) data, to evaluate the assumptions involved in interpretation of the data, to exercise quality control, and to select data appropriate for specific goals. Four data bases for the Late Quaternary, documenting changes in lake levels since 30 14C kyr BP (the Global Lake Status Data Base), vegetation distribution at 18 14C kyr and 6 14C kyr BP (BIOME 6000), aeolian accumulation rates during the last glacial-interglacial cycle (DIRTMAP), and tropical terrestrial climates at the Last Glacial Maximum (the LGM Tropical Terrestrial Data Synthesis) are summarised. Each has been used to evaluate simulations of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 21 calendar kyr BP) and/or mid-Holocene (6 cal. kyr BP) environments. Comparisons have demonstrated that changes in radiative forcing and orography due to orbital and ice-sheet variations explain the first-order, broad-scale (in space and time) features of global climate change since the LGM. However, atmospheric models forced by 6 cal. kyr BP orbital changes with unchanged surface conditions fail to capture quantitative aspects of the observed climate, including the greatly increased magnitude and northward shift of the African monsoon during the early to mid-Holocene. Similarly, comparisons with palaeoenvironmental datasets show that atmospheric models have underestimated the magnitude of cooling and drying of much of the land surface at the LGM The inclusion of feedbacks due to changes in ocean- and land-surface conditions at both times, and atmospheric dust loading at the LGM, appears to be required in order to produce a better simulation of these past climates. The development of Earth system models incorporating the dynamic interactions among ocean, atmosphere, and vegetation is therefore mandated by Quaternary science results as well as climatological principles. For greatest scientific benefit, this development must be paralleled by continued advances in palaeodata analysis and synthesis, which in turn will help to define questions that call for new focused data collection efforts.},

Key determinants of trace metal body concentrations are bioavailability from seawater and from food. However, the nature of the trace metal (essential vs non-essential, chemical properties, etc.) and the physiological state of the organism, strongly influence subsequent handling, distribution, tissue accumulation and excretion. 3. The roles of metal-binding proteins (metallothioneins, transferrin-like proteins, etc.) and haemolymph cellular elements in metal transport and storage are described. 4. Uptake of many trace metals from seawater generally conforms to Fick's Law of Diffusion, but is also influenced by non-specific binding to ligands in body fluids and cells, potential differences across body surfaces and, in some instances, by active transport processes involving ionic pumps and pinocytosis. 5. Potential mechanisms underlying regulation of whole organism and tissue metal loads are outlined and compared with accumulation strategies. The significance of trace metal levels is discussed with regard to the well-being of marine invertebrates and their use in biomonitoring studies of trace metal pollution. ?? 1990.},

Thus, the total amount of prokaryotic carbon is 60-100{\%} of the estimated total carbon in plants, and inclusion of prokaryotic carbon in global models will almost double estimates of the amount of carbon stored in living organisms. In addition, the earth's prokaryotes contain 85-130 Pg of N and 9-14 Pg of P, or about 10-fold more of these nutrients than do plants, and represent the largest pool of these nutrients in living organisms. Most of the earth's prokaryotes occur in the open ocean, in soil, and in oceanic and terrestrial subsurfaces, where the numbers of cells are 1.2 x 10(29), 2.6 x 10(29), 3.5 x 10(30), and 0. 25-2.5 x 10(30), respectively. The numbers of heterotrophic prokaryotes in the upper 200 m of the open ocean, the ocean below 200 m, and soil are consistent with average turnover times of 6-25 days, 0.8 yr, and 2.5 yr, respectively. Although subject to a great deal of uncertainty, the estimate for the average turnover time of prokaryotes in the subsurface is on the order of 1-2 x 10(3) yr. The cellular production rate for all prokaryotes on earth is estimated at 1.7 x 10(30) cells/yr and is highest in the open ocean. The large population size and rapid growth of prokaryotes provides an enormous capacity for genetic diversity.},

Such controlled mineralization in biology occurs within restricted volumes constructed for this purpose and there is significant evidence that some crystals with complex morphologies may form via an amorphous precursor phase. We here investigate morphological control of single crystals, using these biological mechanisms as inspiration. Calcite was precipitated within the cylindrical pores of track-etch membranes via an amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) precursor phase. Perfect replication of the pore channel to yield rod-shaped single crystals of calche was only achieved when the ACC precursor particles entirely filled the pore channels prior to crystallization, a process dependent on the pore diameter. Misshapen particles were formed in all pore diameters in the absence of an ACC phase. This system provides an ideal opportunity to carry out a systematic study into the effect of pore diameter, and the presence of an ACC precursor phase on crystal growth.},

abstract = {Physiology corrupts geochemical records of mollusk shells in many ways, e.g., by actively controlling the incorporation of trace elements in the skeleton. However, the effects of variable biomineralization rates and growth cessation have largely remained unconsidered. Mediated by endogenous timekeeping mechanisms, mollusks stop growing skeletal material on a regular basis ranging from ultradian to annual timescales. During growth cessation, the shells do not record environmental conditions. Shell growth also stops when environmental conditions are beyond the physiological tolerance of the organism, e.g., above and below genetically determined, species-specific thermal extremes where shell growth slows and eventually ceases. Such growth disruptions can occur at non-periodic time intervals. Due to growth retardations and halts, proxy records of mollusk shells are thus incomplete, and reconstructed environmental amplitudes prone to truncation. Furthermore, environmental records are biased toward the physiological optimum of the animal. Favorable environmental conditions increase shell growth, whereas adverse environmental conditions result in reduced shell production and lowered overall metabolism. Not least, the duration of the growing season and overall growth rate decrease as the mollusk grows older. Mathematical modeling approaches can significantly improve proxy records obtained from mollusk shells. For example, if the duration of growth cessation is known, it may be possible to model the missing environmental record. It is also fairly easy to account for age-related growth trends, or variable time-averaging in different portions of the shell. However, a major premise for a reliable interpretation of proxy records from a mollusk shell or other organisms secreting biogenic hard parts is a proper understanding of the physiology, and of course, a high-resolution record of the many different environmental factors that may influence physiology and shell growth. The present paper reviews examples from the literature, and unpublished data on how physiology influences geochemical proxy records from mollusk shells, and presents methods how to eliminate such adverse effects.},

abstract = {Atom-probe tomography (APT) is in the midst of a dynamic renaissance as a result of the development of well-engineered commercial instruments that are both robust and ergonomic and capable of collecting large data sets, hundreds of millions of atoms, in short time periods compared to their predecessor instruments. An APT setup involves a field-ion microscope coupled directly to a special time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer that permits one to determine the mass-to-charge states of individual field-evaporated ions plus their x-, y-, and z-coordinates in a specimen in direct space with subnanoscale resolution. The three-dimensional (3D) data sets acquired are analyzed using increasingly sophisticated software programs that utilize high-end workstations, which permit one to handle continuously increasing large data sets. APT has the unique ability to dissect a lattice, with subnanometer-scale spatial resolution, using either voltage or laser pulses, on an atom-by-atom and atomic planeby-plane basis and to reconstruct it in 3D with the chemical identity of each detected atom identified by TOF mass spectrometry. Employing pico- or femtosecond laser pulses using visible (green or blue light) to ultraviolet light makes the analysis of metallic, semiconducting, ceramic, and organic materials practical to different degrees of success. The utilization of dual-beam focused ion-beam microscopy for the preparation of microtip specimens from multilayer and surface films, semiconductor devices, and for producing site-specific specimens greatly extends the capabilities of APT to a wider range of scientific and engineering problems than could previously be studied for a wide range of materials: metals, semiconductors, ceramics, biominerals, and organic materials},

abstract = {Micro X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy at the Mg K-edge is a useful technique for acquiring information about the environment of Mg(2+) in biogenic calcite. These analyses can be applied to shell powders or intact shell structures. The advantage of the latter is that the XANES analyses can be applied to specific areas, at high (e.g. micrometre) spatial resolution, to determine the environment of Mg(2+) in a biomineral context. Such in situ synchrotron analysis has to take into account the potential effect of crystallographic orientation given the anisotropy of calcite crystals and the polarized nature of X-rays. Brachiopod shells of species with different crystallographic orientations are used to assess this crystallographic effect on in situ synchrotron measurements at the Mg K-edge. Results show that, owing to the anisotropy of calcite, in situ X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) are influenced by the crystallographic orientation of calcite crystals with a subsequent potentially erroneous interpretation of Mg(2+) data. Thus, this study demonstrates the importance of crystallography for XAS analyses and, therefore, the necessity to obtain crystallographic information at high spatial resolution prior to spectroscopic analysis.},

abstract = {When using the boron isotopic composition (??11B) of marine carbonates as a seawater pH proxy, it is assumed that only the tetrahedral borate ion is incorporated into the growing carbonate crystals and that no boron isotope fractionation occurs during uptake. However, the ??11B of the calcium carbonate from most modern foraminifera shells or corals skeletons is not the same as the ??11B of seawater borate, which depends on pH, an observation commonly attributed to vital effects. In this study, we combined previously published high-field 11B MAS NMR and new ??11B measurements on the same synthetic calcite and aragonite samples precipitated inorganically under controlled environments to avoid vital effects. Our results indicate that the main controlling factors of ??11B are the solution pH and the mineralogy of the precipitated carbonate mineral, whereas the aqueous boron concentration of the solution, CaCO3 precipitation rate and the presence or absence of growth seeds all appear to have negligible influence. In aragonite, the NMR data show that boron coordination is tetrahedral (BO4), in addition, its ??11B is equal to that of aqueous borate, thus confirming the paleo-pH hypothesis. In contrast, both trigonal BO3 and tetrahedral BO4 are present in calcite, and its ??11B values are higher than that of aqueous borate and are less sensitive to solution pH variations compared to ??11B in aragonite. These observations are interpreted in calcite as a reflection of the incorporation of decreasing amounts of boric acid with increasing pH. Moreover, the fraction of BO3 measured by NMR in calcite is higher than that inferred from ??11B which indicates a coordination change from BO4 to BO3 upon boron incorporation in the solid. Overall, this study shows that although the observed differences in ??11B between inorganic and biological aragonite are compatible with a pH increase at calcification sites, the B speciation and isotope composition of biological calcites call for a more complex mechanism of boron incorporation.},

Similar to terrestrial vegetation(1-3), marine phytoplankton diversity is a unimodal function of phytoplankton biomass, with maximum diversity at intermediate levels of phytoplankton biomass and minimum diversity during massive blooms. Contrary to expectation, we did not find a relation between phytoplankton diversity and zooplankton diversity. Zooplankton diversity is a unimodal function of zooplankton biomass. Most strikingly, these marine biodiversity patterns show a worldwide consistency, despite obvious differences in environmental conditions of the various oceanographic regions. These findings may serve as a new benchmark in the search for global biodiversity patterns of plants and herbivores.},

Here, we review recent studies of ions at the air/water interface and compare from this perspective water with other polar solvents. For water, we focus in particular on the surface behavior of its ionic product (i.e., hydronium and hydroxide ions). We also investigate the feasibility of dielectric models for the description of the protein/water interface, in analogy to the air/water interface. Little correlation is found between these two interfaces in terms of ion segregation. Therefore, we suggest a local model of pairing of ions from the solution with charged and polar groups at the protein surface. We also describe corresponding results of experimental studies on aqueous model systems.},

abstract = {A field survey of antifoulant concentrations was undertaken in two UK estuaries (Hamble and Orwell) in 1998 and 1999. The two locations offered variations in physical aspects (Orwell estuary being significantly larger than the Hamble) as well as differences in boat densities (Hamble having almost twice as many vessels moored in the estuary and marinas). Samples were analysed for copper, zinc, diuron and Irgarol 1051, and were collected in summer and winter in order to identify potential seasonal variations in concentrations. The effect that different marina types (e.g. locked marina, one located in a natural inlet and pontooned ones in the open estuary) had on antifoulant concentrations were also investigated. Concentrations of the organic booster biocides, diuron and Irgarol 1051 in the marinas and estuaries were mainly influenced by leaching from antifoulant paints applied to the hulls of leisure craft, and so levels reflected the number of vessels present in the water. As a consequence significantly higher concentrations were found in marinas (up to ca. 900 ng l−1 for diuron and 240 ng l−1 for Irgarol 1051) compared with estuaries (up to ca. 400 ng l−1 for diuron and 100 ng l−1 for Irgarol 1051) and in summer compared with winter. Sediment concentrations of Irgarol 1051 and diuron were rarely detectable other than in the marinas where high concentrations were detected near slipways assumed to be derived from washed off paint chips. Dissolved concentration profiles for copper and zinc in the estuaries and marinas were different from those for the organic booster biocides partly because other sources of these metals contributed to estuarine and marina loads. In particular, riverine loads and inputs from sacrificial anodes attached to leisure craft, exhibited a major influence of estuarine levels of zinc. Consequently, only in the Hamble estuary for copper was there a clear distinction between summer (typically 3–4 µg l−1) and winter dissolved values (typically 1–2 µg l−1) that could be largely attributable to the leaching of antifoulant paints. Sediment concentrations for both metals were similar for both estuaries, with little variation between winter and summer values (Zn ranging from 28 to 614 mg kg−1 and Cu from 6 to 1016 mg kg−1) as with the organic booster biocides highest levels were measured at the base of slipways in marinas.},

abstract = {Phenology, the study of annually recurring life cycle events such as the timing of migrations and flowering, can provide particularly sensitive indicators of climate change1. Changes in phenology may be important to ecosystem function because the level of response to climate change may vary across functional groups and multiple trophic levels. The decoupling of phenological relationships will have important ramifications for trophic interactions, altering food-web structures and leading to eventual ecosystem-level changes. Temperate marine environments may be particularly vulnerable to these changes because the recruitment success of higher trophic levels is highly dependent on synchronization with pulsed planktonic production2, 3. Using long-term data of 66 plankton taxa during the period from 1958 to 2002, we investigated whether climate warming signals4 are emergent across all trophic levels and functional groups within an ecological community. Here we show that not only is the marine pelagic community responding to climate changes, but also that the level of response differs throughout the community and the seasonal cycle, leading to a mismatch between trophic levels and functional groups.},

Here we apply standard oxidative and reductive foraminiferal cleaning procedures to core top Krithe pernoides valves from boxcore OCE205-50BC (26.23??N, 77.7??W, 817. m water depth) to evaluate the effects of contamination on Mg/Ca ratios and assess the impact of cleaning techniques on contaminant removal and ostracod valve chemistry. Our results show that clays and Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides influence the Mg/Ca of Krithe. Following sonication in methanol/ultrapure water, there is a 1.6. mmol/mol (11{\%}) decrease in Mg/Ca (equivalent to a reduction in reconstructed temperature of 1.5. ??C), indicating that this is a critical step in the preparation of Krithe valves for Mg/Ca analyses. Oxidation with buffered hydrogen peroxide has little effect on the Mg/Ca of valves from our site. Reductive cleaning reduces inter-valve variability from 12{\%} to 5{\%}, resulting in an equivalent temperature precision of ??. 0.6. ??C. However, reductive cleaning also decreases Mg/Ca ratios due to the partial dissolution of the valve surface. Reductive cleaning offers the potential to improve Krithe Mg/Ca paleotemperature reconstructions and should be utilised in future Krithe Mg/Ca studies. Future work should also aim to constrain the effects of partial dissolution of the valve surface. ?? 2014.},

abstract = {Planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca is one of the most widely applied sea surface temperature proxies. While the influence of salinity on Mg/Ca has led the accuracy of Mg/Ca- temperatures to be questioned, the effect of seawater carbonate chemistry (pH) is seldom accounted for down-core. Using published datasets, we review controls on Mg/Ca in laboratory cultures of planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber (white), Trilobatus sacculifer, Globigerina bulloides and Orbulina universa. All are characterised by a temperature sensitivity of {\~{}}6{\%} per °C and a salinity sensitivity of {\~{}}4{\%} per PSU, while all except T. sacculifer are sensitive to carbonate chemistry (-5 to -9{\%} per 0.1 pH unit). We demonstrate the manifestation of these sensitivities using down-core data spanning the last glacial maximum (LGM) and an Earth System Model forced with LGM conditions. While the effects of salinity are relatively minor, seawater carbonate chemistry exerts a large bias on Mg/Ca-temperature if unaccounted for; however, as local pH changes beyond the effect of atmospheric CO2 are relatively small in most of the ocean ({\textless}±0.05 pH units, 2?), atmospheric CO2 can be used to accurately correct Mg/Ca temperatures. We present protocols to correct Mg/Ca for pH downcore using either atmospheric CO2 or (preferably) boron isotopes in a new software package ‘MgCaRB'.},

abstract = {[1] Paired Mg/Ca and delta(18)O measurements on planktonic foraminiferal species ( G. ruber white, G. ruber pink, G. sacculifer, G. conglobatus, G. aequilateralis, O. universa, N. dutertrei, P. obliquiloculata, G. inflata, G. truncatulinoides, G. hirsuta, and G. crassaformis) from a 6-year sediment trap time series in the Sargasso Sea were used to define the sensitivity of foraminiferal Mg/Ca to calcification temperature. Habitat depths and calcification temperatures were estimated from comparison of delta(18)O of foraminifera with equilibrium calcite, based on historical temperature and salinity data. When considered together, Mg/Ca ( mmol/ mol) of all species, except two, show a significant ( r = 0.93) relationship with temperature ( T degreesC) of the form Mg/Ca = 0.38 (+/- 0.02) exp 0.090 ( +/- 0.003) T, equivalent to a 9.0 +/- 0.3{\%} change in Mg/Ca for a 1 degreesC change in temperature. Small differences exist in calibrations between species and between different size fractions of the same species. O. universa and G. aequilateralis have higher Mg/Ca than other species, and in general, data can be best described with the same temperature sensitivity for all species and pre-exponential constants in the sequence O. universa {\textgreater} G. aequilateralis approximate to G. bulloides {\textgreater} G. ruber approximate to G. sacculifer approximate to other species. This approach gives an accuracy of +/- 1.2 degreesC in the estimation of calcification temperature. The similar to9{\%} sensitivity to temperature is similar to published studies from culture and core top calibrations, but differences exist from some literature values of pre-exponential constants. Different cleaning methodologies and artefacts of core top dissolution are probably implicated, and perhaps environmental factors yet understood. Planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca temperature estimates can be used for reconstructing surface temperatures and mixed and thermocline temperatures ( using G. ruber pink, G. ruber white, G. sacculifer, N. dutertrei, P. obliquiloculata, etc.). The existence of a single Mg thermometry equation is valuable for extinct species, although use of species-specific equations will, where statistically significant, provide more accurate evaluation of Mg/Ca paleotemperature.},

abstract = {Sediment samples from the Ontong-Java Plateau in the Pacific and the 90° east ridge in the Indian Ocean were used to investigate whether shell size and early diagenesis affect $\delta$11B of the symbiont-bearing planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides sacculifer. In pristine shells from both study locations we found a systematic increase of $\delta$11B and Mg/Ca with shell size. Shells in the sieve size class 515–865 $\mu$m revealed $\delta$11B values +2.1 to +2.3‰ higher than shells in the 250–380 $\mu$m class. This pattern is most likely due to differences in symbiont photosynthetic activity and its integrated effect on the pH of the foraminiferal microenvironment. We therefore suggest smaller individuals must live at approximately 50–100 m water depth where ambient light levels are lower. Using the empirical calibration curve for $\delta$11B in G. sacculifer, only shells larger than 425 $\mu$m reflect surface seawater pH. Partial dissolution of shells derived from deeper sediment cores was determined by shell weight analyses and investigation of the shell surface microstructure by scanning electron microscopy. The $\delta$11B in partially dissolved shells is up to 2‰ lower relative to pristine shells of the same size class. In agreement with a relatively higher weight loss in smaller shells, samples from the Ontong-Java Plateau show a more pronounced dissolution effect than larger shells. On the basis of the primary size effect and potential postdepositional dissolution effects, we recommend the use of shells that are visually pristine and, in the case of G. sacculifer, larger than 500 $\mu$m for paleoreconstructions.},

abstract = {Bees, wasps and ants learn landmarks as views from particular vantage points, storing the retinal positions of landmark edges. By moving so as to minimise the difference between their stored and current view, they can return to the vantage point from which a view was taken. We have examined what wood ants learn about a laterally placed, extended landmark, a wall, while walking parallel to it to reach a feeder and how they use this stored information to guide their path. Manipulation of the height of the wall and the ant's starting distance from it reveals that ants maintain a desired distance from the wall by keeping the image of the top of the wall at a particular retinal elevation. Ants can thus employ image matching both for returning to a place and for following a fixed route. Unlike many flying insects, an ant's direction of motion while walking is always along its longitudinal body axis and, perhaps for this reason, it favours its frontal retina for viewing discrete landmarks. We find that ants also use their frontal retina for viewing a laterally placed wall. On a coarse scale, the ant's path along the wall is straight, but on a finer scale it is roughly sinusoidal, allowing the ant to scan the surrounding landscape with its frontal retina. The ant's side-to-side scanning means that the wall is viewed with its frontal retina for phases of the scanning cycle throughout its trajectory. Details of the scanning pattern depend on the scene. Ants scan further to the side that is empty of the wall than to the side containing the wall, and they scan further into the wall side when the wall is of a lower apparent height. We conclude that frontal retina is employed for image storage and for path control.},

abstract = {A fluorescent pH indicator in conjunction with confocal microscopy, was used to map intracellular pH in a variety of cells and tissues with high spatial resolution. The new pH-sensitive fluorescent probe SNARF-1 was excited with the 488 nm band of the argon ion laser of a Bio-Rad MRC-500 confocal microscope. Ratio images were created with pixel-by-pixel division, with the intensity of these images representing a function of pH, that is independent of dye concentration, photobleaching or path length. Cell cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle were loaded with 20 ??m{\{}cyrillic{\}} SNARF-1/AM for 20 min at 37??C. Intracellular pH levels were calibrated in situ by treatment of each cell with nigericin (20 ??m{\{}cyrillic{\}}) in solutions of known pH. The cytosolic pH of the majority of cells was uniform, however, pH gradients were evident between the cytosol and nuclear regions, indicating the ability of this technique to map intracellular and intraorganelle pH. Rat C6 glioblastoma spheroids were cultured then loaded with SNARF-1/AM at 10??C for 90 min. The pH values were calibrated in vitro, using SNARF-1 acid in buffered solutions of known pH. Ratio images of the bisected spheroids showed a marked gradient in pH from the outer cells compared with central necrotic cells. The degree of involvement of acidification in muscle fatigue was investigated by simultaneously determining force generation and intracellular pH in individual fibres of an intact rat muscle. The investigation was performed during a stimulation protocol which induced significant fatigue in the force response of the muscle. The fatigue protocol induced little change in cytosolic pH in the fibres. We show that the use of SNARF-1, in conjunction with confocal microscopy is a powerful technique for accurately mapping pH within single cells, multicellular tissues and intact organs, as well as for accurately recording dynamic changes in pH. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the origin and evolution of coccolithophores and presents an up-to-date summary of coccolithophore evolution, integrating recent stratophenetic, molecular phylogenetic, biogeochemical, and biological data. A discussion is presented on the origin and nature of the haptophyte ancestors of coccolithophores, the origin of coccolithophores, and the onset of calcification. The chapter also illustrates different evolutionary trajectories that succeeding lineages have followed. This evolutionary scheme is then correlated to abiotic and biotic records of historical change in the Earth system, allowing us to evaluate the various extrinsic and possibly intrinsic genomic forces that have driven coccolithophore evolution and the resulting feedbacks of their evolution on the ecosystem. Finally, based on the interpretations of coccolithophore evolutionary history, an uncertain future for this clade in the high CO2 and high Mg/low Ca world of the Anthropocene is envisioned. This emerging monophyletic entity of potentially calcifying haptophytes has no formal scientific name, and here the erection of a new subclass, the Calcihaptophycidae is proposed. Further justification of this new taxonomic designation is provided in the chapter. An increasing number of species from across the phylogeny of the Prymnesiophyceae have been shown to exhibit haplodiploid life cycles. Furthermore, the seawater Mg: Ca ratio has shown a significant increase since the K/T, with the onset of a new, Neogene, Aragonite ocean. The modern Mg: Ca ratio of ???5 is higher than ever before in the Phanerozoic and may significantly increase the metabolic cost to the Calcihaptophycidae of producing calcite coccoliths. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The remarkably high potential for population growth results from the short life cycle and continual reproduction as a population. Previously, the production of planktonic larvae with the ability to disperse over a wide area was considered one of the most important life history characteristics of opportunistic polychaetes in unpredictable habitats. In the present study, however, Capitella sp. exhibited opportunistic population dynamics during benthic recovery after defaunation in heavily polluted areas, despite production of a small number of large eggs with restricted dispersal ability via lecithotrophic larvae. The size cornposibon of the recolonizing population suggested that some of the worms were recruited as mature adults from a very small population maintalned in the immediate vicinity of the sampling station in an environment disturbed by organic pollution. Although the populahon dynamics of Capitella sp. appear to be characteristic of highly opportunisbc organisms, results suggest that populations may be maintained within each habitat by reliance only on a remarkably large potential for population growth. In general, organically polluted areas may not be temporary habitats that Capitella sp. can utilize only during benthic recovery immediately after defaunation, but rather such areas may be their native habitats.},

abstract = {Most of the Indian air-breathing teleosts are primarily ammoniotelic, but appear to have retained the genes for the urea cycle enzymes, since a full complement of urea cycle enzymes have been reported for many of them. The ability to synthesize urea by these fish is probably due to their amphibious nature, and their normal habitat of swamps, where the water ammonia level may to be quite high, is uninhabitable to any typical freshwater teleosts. One of these air-breathing species, the singhi catfish (Heteropneustes fossilis), can tolerate very high ambient total ammonia concentrations (up to 75 mM ammonium chloride) for weeks without any deleterious effects. Transition from ammoniotelism to ureotelism occurs in some of these species of air-breathing fish when exposed to apparently stressful conditions such as higher ambient ammonia, to air, and also when they live in semidry condition inside mud during habitat drying. Although the real mechanism(s) of regulation of ureogenesis is not clear in these fish, given available data, it is hypothesized that the accumulation of ammonia within the body per se under the above stressful conditions is likely the internal modulator for enhanced ureogenesis mainly to avoid any build up of ammonia to a level that can be toxic to these fish. An active urea cycle is believed to predominate over uricolysis as a source of urea, even though both pathways are present in these air-breathing fish. The presence of significant levels of both carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS), CPS I-like and CPS III activities, reported in some air-breathing catfishes, may represent intermediate scenarios for a proposed evolutionary transition from CPS III to CPS I, or may play an important physiological adaptive role in the tolerance of these fish to high concentrations of ambient ammonia},

abstract = {Trace elements in calcareous organisms have been widely used for paleoclimatic studies. However, the factors controlling their incorporation into mollusc shells are still unclear. We studied here the Sr, Mg, Ba and Mn serial records in the shells of two aragonitic marine bivalve species: Mesodesma donacium and Chione subrugosa from the Peruvian Coast. The elemental concentrations were compared to local temperature and salinity records. The relationships with crystal growth rate G were investigated thanks to well defined periodic growth structures providing a precise shell chronology. Our results show that for both species, environmental parameters only have minor influence, whereas crystal growth rate strongly influences trace elements concentrations, especially for Sr (explaining up to 74{\%} of the variance). The relationship between G and Sr/Ca exhibits variability among the shells as well as inside the shells. For a same growth rate value, Sr/Ca values are higher in more curved shell sections, and the growth rate influence is stronger as well. We show that intercellular and Ca2+-pump pathways cannot support the calcification Ca2+ flux, leading us to propose an alternative mechanism for ionic transport through the calcifying mantle, implying a major role for calcium channels on mantle epithelial cell membranes. In this new calcification model, Sr/Ca shell ratios is determined by Ca2+-channel selectivity against Sr2+, which depends (i) on the electrochemical potential imposed by the crystallisation process and (ii) on the Ca2+-channel density per surface unit on mantle epithelia. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Geological and geochemical evidence indicates that the Antarctic ice sheet formed during the Eocene–Oligocene transition, 33.5–34.0 million years ago. Modelling studies suggest that such ice-sheet formation might have been triggered when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels pCO2 atm fell below a critical threshold of approx 750 p.p.m.v., but the timing and magnitude of pCO2 atm relative to the evolution of the ice sheet has remained unclear. Here we use the boron isotope pH proxy on exceptionally well-preserved carbonate microfossils from a recently discovered geological section in Tanzania to estimate pCO2 atm before, during and after the climate transition. Our data suggest that a reduction in pCO2 atm occurred before the main phase of ice growth, followed by a sharp recovery to pre-transition values and then a more gradual decline. During maximum ice-sheet growth, pCO2 atm was between approx450 and approx1,500 p.p.m.v., with a central estimate of approx760 p.p.m.v. The ice cap survived the period of pCO2 atm recovery, although possibly with some reduction in its volume, implying (as models predict) a nonlinear response to climate forcing during melting. Overall, our results confirm the central role of declining pCO2atm in the development of the Antarctic ice sheet (in broad agreement with carbon cycle modelling) and help to constrain mechanisms and feedbacks associated with the Earth's biggest climate switch of the past 65 Myr.},

Mesoscale iron addition experiments (FeAXs) have unequivocally shown that iron supply limits production in one-third of the world ocean, where surface macronutrient concentrations are perennially high. The findings of these 12 FeAXs also reveal that iron supply exerts controls on the dynamics of plankton blooms, which in turn affect the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and sulfur and ultimately influence the Earth climate system. However, extrapolation of the key results of FeAXs to regional and seasonal scales in some cases is limited because of differing modes of iron supply in FeAXs and in the modern and paleo-oceans.

In the past, long-term changes in the slope of size spectra of research vessel catches have been related to changes in fishing effort, but such changes may simply reflect the cumulative, direct effects of fishing through selective removal of large individuals. If there is resilience in a fish community towards fishing, we may expect increases in specific components, for instance as a consequence of an associated reduction in predation and/or competition. We show on the basis of three long-term trawl surveys that abundance of small fish (all species) as well as abundance of demersal species with a low maximum length (Lmax) have steadily and significantly increased in absolute numbers over large parts of the North Sea during the last 30 years. Taking average fishing mortality of assessed commercial species as an index of exploitation rate of the fish community, it appears that fishing effort reached its maximum in the mid-1980s and has declined slightly since. If the observed changes in the community are caused by indirect effects of fishing, there must be a considerable delay in response time, because the observed changes generally proceed up to recent years, although both size and Lmax spectra suggest some levelling off, or even recovery in one of the surveys. Indeed, significant correlations between all community metrics and exploitation rate were obtained only if time lags ???6 years were introduced. ?? 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Applications of transport time scales are pervasive in biological, hydrologic, and geochemical studies yet these times scales are not consistently defined and applied with rigor in the literature. We compare three transport time scales (flushing time, age, and residence time) commonly used to measure the retention of water or scalar quantities transported with water. We identify the underlying assumptions associated with each time scale, describe procedures for computing these time scales in idealized cases, and identify pitfalls when real-world systems deviate from these idealizations. We then apply the time scale definitions to a shallow 378 ha tidal lake to illustrate how deviations between real water bodies and the idealized examples can result from: (1) non-steady flow; (2) spatial variability in bathymetry, circulation, and transport time scales; and (3) tides that introduce complexities not accounted for in the idealized cases. These examples illustrate that no single transport time scale is valid for all time periods, locations, and constituents, and no one time scale describes all transport processes. We encourage aquatic scientists to rigorously define the transport time scale when it is applied, identify the underlying assumptions in the application of that concept, and ask if those assumptions are valid in the application of that approach for computing transport time scales in real systems.},

abstract = {In soils, mycorrhiza (microscopic fungal hypha) living in symbiosis with plant roots are the biological interface by which plants obtain, from rocks and organic matter, the nutrients necessary for their growth and maintenance. Despite their central role in soils, the mechanism and kinetics of mineral alteration by mycorrhiza are poorly constrained quantitatively. Here, we report in situ quantification of weathering rates from a mineral substrate, (001) basal plane of biotite, by a surface-bound hypha of Paxillus involutus, grown in association with the root system of a Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris. Four thin-sections were extracted by focused ion beam (FIB) milling along a single hypha grown over the biotite surface. Depth-profile of Si, O, K, Mg, Fe and Al concentrations were performed at the hypha-biotite interface by scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX). Large removals of K (50-65{\%}), Mg (55-75{\%}), Fe (80-85{\%}) and Al (75-85{\%}) were observed in the topmost 40nm of biotite underneath the hypha while Si and O are preserved throughout the depth-profile. A quantitative model of alteration at the hypha-scale was developed based on solid-state diffusion fluxes of elements into the hypha and the break-down/mineralogical re-arrangement of biotite. A strong acidification was also observed with hypha bound to the biotite surface reaching pH{\textless}4.6. When consistently compared with the abiotic biotite dissolution, we conclude that the surface-bound mycorrhiza accelerate the biotite alteration kinetics between pH 3.5 and 5.8 to ???0.04??molbiotitem-2h-1. Our current work reaffirms that fungal mineral alteration is a process that combines our previously documented bio-mechanical forcing with the ??m-scale acidification mediated by surface-bound hypha and a subsequent chemical element removal due to the fungal action. As such, our study presents a first kinetic framework for mycorrhizal alteration at the hypha-scale under close-to-natural experimental conditions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.The calcite tests of foraminifera lie in marine sediments for thousands to millions of years, before being analyzed to generate trace element and isotope paleoproxy records. These sediments constitute a distinct physio-chemical environment from the conditions in which the tests formed. Storage in sediments can modify the trace element and isotopic content of foraminiferal calcite through diagenetic alteration, which has the potential to confound their paleoceanographic interpretation. A previous study of Globorotalia tumida from the Ontong Java Plateau, western equatorial Pacific, found that preferential dissolution of higher-Mg chamber calcite and the preservation of a low-Mg crust on the tests significantly reduced whole-test Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca. Here we revisit specimens with a combination of synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (sXCT) and electron probe microanalyses to reevaluate the nature of their diagenetic alteration. The dissolution of higher-Mg calcite with depth was directly observed in the sXCT data, confirming the inference of the previous study. The sXCT data further reveal a thickening of the chemically and structurally distinct calcite crust with depth. We propose that these crusts have a diagenetic origin, driven by the simultaneous dissolution of high-Mg chamber calcite and precipitation of low-Mg crust from the resulting modified pore water solution. While the breadth of the study is limited by the nature of the techniques, the observation of both dissolution and reprecipitation of foraminiferal calcite serves to demonstrate the action of two simultaneous diagenetic alteration processes, with significant impacts on the resulting paleoproxy signals. Key Points Foraminiferal calcite both dissolves and reprecipitates in the sediments The newly precipitated crust is compositionally distinct from chamber calcite These changes have the potential to affect paleoproxy records.},

This is achieved by modelling the total scattered intensity, comprising both the Bragg peak intensity and the diffuse contribution to the spectrum from the scattering density of an assembly of atoms. This assembly, which is constructed by the reverse Monte Carlo technique so as to yield a best fit with the data, is then used to calculate the average atomic thermal displacements.

abstract = {The formation of calcareous skeletons by marine planktonic organisms and their subsequent sinking to depth generates a continuous rain of calcium carbonate to the deep ocean and underlying sediments. This is important in regulating marine carbon cycling and ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange. The present rise in atmospheric CO2 levels causes significant changes in surface ocean pH and carbonate chemistry. Such changes have been shown to slow down calcification in corals and coralline macroalgae, but the majority of marine calcification occurs in planktonic organisms. Here we report reduced calcite production at increased CO2 concentrations in monospecific cultures of two dominant marine calcifying phytoplankton species, the coccolithophorids Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica. This was accompanied by an increased proportion of malformed coccoliths and incomplete coccospheres. Diminished calcification led to a reduction in the ratio of calcite precipitation to organic matter production. Similar results were obtained in incubations of natural plankton assemblages from the north Pacific ocean when exposed to experimentally elevated CO2 levels. We suggest that the progressive increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may therefore slow down the production of calcium carbonate in the surface ocean. As the process of calcification releases CO2 to the atmosphere, the response observed here could potentially act as a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 levels.},

abstract = {The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is unique in that it has continually high concentrations of major plant nutrients but low phytoplankton biomass. This enigmatic phenomenon is the focus of significant speculation that trace nutrients, including Fe, may limit phytoplankton crop size. Global climatologies indicate that the ACC is a region with low surface temperatures, weak density stratification, little summertime surface solar irradiance, and strong wind stress. These physical phenomena act to limit growth rates of the phytoplankton community. Using a photo-physiological description of phytoplankton growth in a simple one-dimensional ecosystem model forced by observations or climatologies of mixing depth and surface irradiance, we make an evaluation of the potential for massive, nutrient-exhausting, phytoplankton blooms forming in the ACC. The ACC has persistent mixed layers in excess of 50 m. Literature values and model optimization indicate that the minimal aggregate specific loss rate for phytoplankton, including respiration, sinking, and grazing, is approximately 0.2 d-1. For a minimal loss rate and typical physical conditions of stratification and surface irradiance, the model predicts that phytoplankton in the ACC would not utilize {\textgreater} 10{\%} of the available macronutrients. Without a mechanism for increasing the strength of stratification, we predict that massive Fe additions to the Southern Ocean would fail to significantly mitigate the atmospheric CO2 derived from fossil fuel.},

The grinding results are mainly determined by two contrary mechanisms: particle breakage and agglomeration of the so-created fragments. These competing phenomena often lead to a plateau in particle size above a certain energy input. The degree of agglomeration and therefore the final aggregate size can be controlled by the addition of stabilizers and by the applied shear forces. In this paper the agglomeration behavior of silica particles under different milling and stability conditions is presented. Furthermore the particle breakage behavior in the nanometer range as the other size-determining mechanism will be discussed.

abstract = {Morphometric analysis of coccoliths of various coccolithophore species from core top and culture samples has revealed that the morphology of single placoliths can be affected by environmental parameters such as temperature, salinity, and productivity. In this study, we have tested the morphological variations of placoliths of Emiliania huxleyi, the most common coccolithophore species in the modern ocean, with respect to environmental gradients. We have investigated especially the potential effect of salinity on the morphology, as it is known from culture studies that the growth of E. huxleyi placoliths is strongly influenced by varying salinities. Morphometric analysis of about 2150 placoliths from 37 globally distributed core top and plankton samples revealed that the morphology of E. huxleyi varies significantly along a sea surface salinity gradient from 33 to 38. Morphological parameters such as the mean size of placoliths are used as explaining variables in multiple regression analysis to reconstruct sea surface salinities (SSS). The best model for mean SSS yields an R2 of 0.88 with a standard error of 0.49 whereas statistical models describing surface water temperature or productivity are less reliable and accurate. Application of the best model to plankton samples allows the prediction of in-situ salinities within given error estimates. The application of the best model to fossil assemblages from the LGM, however, is more puzzling. Paleosalinity reconstructions in the South Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea, and the subtropical Atlantic are in good agreement with the published values. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Negative excess volumes exist below 20 mole{\%} MgCO 3 , and positive excess volumes exist above 20 mole{\%} MgCO 3 . Several samples of biogenic magnesian calcites in the same composition range exhibit chemical heterogeneities. Echinoid skeletal parts vary by up to 5 mole{\%} MgCO 3 . Algae has neighboring domains differing by up to 10 mole{\%} MgCO 3 . Difference in unit cell geometry with respect to synthetic phases were also observed. Cell volumes and c/a ratios for most biogenic specimens do not vary smoothly with composition and generally exceed those of synthetic phases. Minor element concentrations do not account for unit cell volume discrepancies. As a result, use of existing X-ray determinative curves based on synthetic phases can lead to errors of over 5 mole{\%} MgCO 3 in the estimation of biogenic magnesian calcite compositions.--Modified journal abstract.},

The benefits of currently available genetically modified (GM) crops in reducing waste and agrochemical use in agriculture, and the potential of the technology for further crop improvement in the future are discussed. The legal requirements for containment of novel GM crops and the roles of relevant regulatory bodies in ensuring that GM crops and food are safe are summarized. Some of the major concerns of the general public regarding GM crops and food: segregation of GM and non-GM crops and cross-pollination between GM crops and wild species, the use of antibiotic resistance marker genes, the prevention of new allergens being introduced in to the food chain and the relative safety of GM and non-GM foods are considered. Finally, the current debate on the use of GM crops in agriculture and the need for the government, scientists and industry to persevere with the technology in the face of widespread hostility is studied.},

Factors which affect radii additivity are polyhedral distortion, partial occupancy of cation sites, covalence, and metallic character. Mean Nb5+-O and Mo6+-O octahedral distances are linearly dependent on distortion. A decrease in cation occupancy increases mean Li+-O, Na+-O, and Ag+-O distances in a predictable manner. Covalence strongly shortens Fe2+-X, Co2+-X, Ni2+-X, Mn2+-X, Cu+-X, Ag+-X, and M-H- bonds as the electronegativity of X or M decreases. Smaller effects are seen for Zn2+-X, Cd2+-X, In2+-X, pb2+-X, and TI+-X.

A unified theory of solid- solution aqueous-solution equilibria as velI as the thermodynamic background of the phenomenon of "stoichiometric saturation" are teviewed. It is shown that Lippmann diagrams effectively summarize the thermodynamic basis of solid- solute aqueous-solution equilibria of sparingly soluble metal carbonate systems. Clearly, the predictive power of these diagrams may be limited due to kinetic restribtions.

abstract = {No single factor accounts fully for the persistently low phytoplankton stocks in the nutrient-rich areas of the open sea. However, grazing plays the necessary role of consuming phytoplankton produced in excess of losses due to physical processes and sinking. Without grazing, even if specific growth rate of the phytoplankton is less than optimal for the prevailing light and temperature conditions, as might be so under limitation by a trace nutrient such as Fe, the phytoplankton stock would still accumulate with attendant depletion of nutrients. Observations during spring and summer in the open subarctic Pacific argue against limitation of phytoplankton growth to the point where phytoplankton stock could not increase in the absence of grazing. An ecosystem process model of the phytoplankton-grazer interaction suggests that two processes-grazing control of phytoplankton stock and preferential utilization of NH4 by the phytoplankton-are sufficient to explain the continuously low phytoplankton stock and high concentrations of macronutrients. However, the grazing control may be exerted on a phytoplankton assemblage structured by Fe limitation. In particular, the intrinsic growth rates of potentially fast-growing diatoms seem to be depressed in the open subarctic Pacific. These conditions probably apply to two other nutrient-rich areas of the open sea, the Pacific equatorial upwelling region and the subantarctic circumpolar ocean, although in the latter region light limitation of phytoplankton growth may be more severe and silica limitation may influence the specific composition of the phytoplankton assemblage.},

Cohen's method of calculation of lattice constants for the elimination of ``drift'' and experimental errors is applied. Methods are developed for the evaluation of standard errors and fiduciary limits of results from a single film and from a set of films. The usefulness of x‐ray targets made of alloys rather than pure elements for the purpose of securing a larger number and better distribution of lines is indicated. The influence of the number and Miller indices of diffraction lines on the values of lattice constants in noncubic systems is shown. The importance of the methods of sample preparation for precision work is emphasized. In Part II, precision measurements on Al, Ni, Ag, Au, Si, Fe, Mo, W, Mg, Zn, Cd, Sb, Bi and Sn are reported for materials of a high degree of purity. The fiduciary limits of these lattice constants vary between 2 and 7 parts per hundred thousand and are so chosen that the probability of the correct value lying between the stated limits is 19 out of 20.},

An outstanding example of organic-inorganic composites is provided by mollusc seashells, whose superior mechanical properties are due to their multi-level crystalline hierarchy and the presence of a small amount (0.1-5 wt{\%}) of organic molecules. The presence of organic molecules, among other characteristics, can influence the coherence length for X-ray scattering in biogenic crystals. Here we show the results of synchrotron high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction measurements in biogenic and non-biogenic (geological) aragonite crystals. On applying the Rietveld refinement procedure to the high-resolution diffraction spectra, we were able to extract the aragonite lattice parameters with an accuracy of 10 p.p.m. As a result, we found anisotropic lattice distortions in biogenic aragonite relative to the geological sample, maximum distortion being 0.1{\%} along the c axis of the orthorhombic unit cell. The organic molecules could be a source of these structural distortions in biogenic crystals. This finding may be important to the general understanding of the biomineralization process and the development of bio-inspired 'smart' materials.},

abstract = {Reconstruction of oceanic nutrient concentrations in the past provides information about nutrient cycling and physical circulation and the role these processes have played in past climate changes. The Cd/Ca and Zn/Ca of benthic foraminifera have been used successfully to reconstruct past deep ocean nutrient concentrations. In this study we test the ability of benthic foraminiferal Cd/Ca and Zn/Ca to detect changes in thermocline nutrient concentrations using a set of 31 multicores collected in the Florida Straits. Multicore sites span depths of 173-751 m, estimated seawater Cd concentrations of 0.02-0.42 nmol kg(-1), and estimated seawater Zn concentrations of 0.3-3.1 nmol kg(-1). Cd/Ca in several taxa of benthic foraminifera captures the regional differences and general shape of the nutricline on either side of the Florida Straits, indicating that it is capable of resolving small changes in upper ocean nutrient concentrations in the past. We estimate that the upper ocean partition coefficient for calcitic Cd/Ca may be slightly higher than the established value. Low seawater Zn concentrations combined with low partition coefficients and slight laboratory contamination severely complicated the evaluation of benthic foraminiferal Zn/Ca. However, at least one species, C. pachyderma, incorporates Zn with a relatively high partition coefficient (similar to 22), minimizing these complications. C. pachyderma Zn/Ca reflects the regional differences and general shape of the nutricline on either side of the Florida Straits and demonstrates potential for thermocline paleoceanography.},

The B K-edge XANES spectra are characterized by three prominent features: a sharp peak at approximately 194 eV (the edge feature of trigonal B), a broader peak at 198-200 eV (the edge feature of tetrahedral B), and a broad peak at 201-204 eV, which is associated with contributions from both trigonal BO3 and tetrahedral BO4 groups. Using the fluorescence yield method to collect spectra, the proportion of tetrahedral B obtained for sodium borosilicate glasses is in good agreement with previous wide line 11B NMR results for R (molar Na2O/B2O3) in the range 0-1.0. The yield of tetrahedral B is consistent with the Bray et al. model for structural change in borate and borosilicate glasses, and indicates that the onset of depolymerization of silicate entities is at about R = 0.33. The XANES peaks shift systematically to lower energy with addition of Na2O, reflecting a progressive decrease in positive charge on absorber atoms. For the first time, small amounts (approximately 1{\%}) of tetrahedral B have been detected in binary B2O3-SiO2 glasses.

abstract = {Synchronized transitions in the polymorph mineralogy of the major reef-building and sediment-producing calcareous marine organisms and abiotic CaCO 3 precipitates (ooids, marine cements) throughout Phanerozoic time are believed to have been caused by tectonically induced variations in the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater (molar Mg/Ca 2Combining double low line aragonite seas", {\textless}2Combining double low line calcite seas). Here, I assess the geological evidence in support of secular variation in seawater Mg/Ca and its effects on marine calcifiers, and review a series of recent experiments that investigate the effects of seawater Mg/Ca (1.0-5.2) on extant representatives of calcifying taxa that have experienced variations in this ionic ratio of seawater throughout the geologic past.-Secular variation in seawater Mg/Ca is supported by synchronized secular variations in (1) the ionic composition of fluid inclusions in primary marine halite, (2) the mineralogies of late stage marine evaporites, abiogenic carbonates, and reef-and sediment-forming marine calcifiers, (3) the Mg/Ca ratios of fossil echinoderms, molluscs, rugose corals, and abiogenic carbonates, (4) global rates of tectonism that drive the exchange of Mg2+ and Ca2+ along zones of ocean crust production, and (5) additional proxies of seawater Mg/Ca including Sr/Mg ratios of abiogenic carbonates, Sr/Ca ratios of biogenic carbonates, and Br concentrations in marine halite.-Laboratory experiments have revealed that aragonite-secreting bryopsidalean algae and scleractinian corals and calcite-secreting coccolithophores exhibit higher rates of calcification and growth in experimental seawaters formulated with seawater Mg/Ca ratios that favor their skeletal mineral. These results support the assertion that seawater Mg/Ca played an important role in determining which hypercalcifying marine organisms were the major reef-builders and sediment-producers throughout Earth history. The observation that primary production increased along with calcification within the bryopsidalean and coccolithophorid algae in mineralogically favorable seawater is consistent with the hypothesis that calcification promotes photosynthesis within some species of these algae through the liberation of CO2.-The experiments also revealed that aragonite-secreting bryopsidalean algae and scleractinian corals, and bacterial biofilms that secrete a mixture of aragonite and high Mg calcite, began secreting an increased proportion of their calcium carbonate as the calcite polymorph in the lower-Mg/Ca experimental seawaters. Furthermore, the Mg/Ca ratio of calcite secreted by the coccolithophores, coralline red algae, reef-dwelling animals (crustacea, urchins, calcareous tube worms), bacterial biofilms, scleractinian corals, and bryopsidalean algae declined with reductions in seawater Mg/Ca. Notably, Mg fractionation in autotrophic organisms was more strongly influenced by changes in seawater Mg/Ca than in heterotrophic organisms, a probable consequence of autotrophic organisms inducing a less controlled mode of calcification simply through the removal of CO 2 via photosynthesis.-These results indicate that biomineralogical control can be partially overridden by ambient seawater Mg/Ca and suggest that modern aragonite-secreting organisms may have secreted a mixture of aragonite and low Mg calcite, and that modern high Mg calcite-secreting organisms probably secreted low Mg calcite, in calcite seas of the past. These effects of seawater Mg/Ca on the polymorph mineralogy and calcite Mg/Ca ratio of calcareous skeletons should be accounted for in thermal-chemical reconstructions of seawater that are based upon skeletal Mg/Ca.-Lastly, by identifying how marine calcifiers respond to changes in seawater Mg/Ca and absolute Ca2+ concentration, this work should enhance our interpretation of parallel studies investigating the effects of anthropogenic CO 2-induced ocean acidification on marine calcification. {\textcopyright} 2010 Author(s).},

Chamber morphogenesis is preceded by the secretion of a cytoplasmic layer rich in mitochondria. The layer expands away from the pre-existing foraminiferal shell surface in a spherical pattern. Full cytoplasm expansion is followed by the secretion of an organic matrix (OM) approximately 200 µm above the original shell surface. Cytoplasm, mitochondria and/or vesicles may play a role in OM secretion. Calcification and chamber thickening, new spine growth and pore development are documented and continue for a period of 1–7 d. Approximately 24 h prior to gamete release, the foraminiferal spines are resorbed and a veneer of calcite is deposited on the shell surface. An extensive intracellular organelle unique to foraminifera, the fibrillar system, is examined and is hypothesized to play a role in the biomineralization process. The taxonomic and functional significance of theO. universa spherical chamber is discussed with respect to other foraminiferal species.},

abstract = {The boron isotope ratio ($\delta$ 11B) of foraminifers and tropical corals has been proposed to record seawater pH. To test the veracity and practicality of this potential paleo-pH proxy in deep sea corals, samples of skeletal material from twelve archived modern Desmophyllum dianthus (D. dianthus) corals from a depth range of 274-1470m in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans, ambient pH range 7.57-8.05, were analyzed for $\delta$ 11B. The $\delta$ 11B values for these corals, spanning a range from 23.56 to 27.88, are found to be related to seawater borate $\delta$ 11B by the linear regression: $\delta$ 11B coral=(0.76±0.28) $\delta$ 11B borate+(14.67±4.19) (1 standard error (SE)). The D. dianthus $\delta$ 11B values are greater than those measured in tropical corals, and suggest substantial physiological modification of pH in the calcifying space by a value that is an inverse function of seawater pH. This mechanism partially compensates for the range of ocean pH and aragonite saturation at which this species grows, enhancing aragonite precipitation and suggesting an adaptation mechanism to low pH environments in intermediate and deep waters. Consistent with the findings of Trotter et al. (2011) for tropical surface corals, the data suggest an inverse correlation between the magnitude of a biologically driven pH offset recorded in the coral skeleton, and the seawater pH, described by the equation: $\Delta$pH=pH recorded by coral-seawater pH=-(0.75±0.12) pH w+(6.88±0.93) (1 SE). Error analysis based on 95{\%} confidence interval(CI) and the standard deviation of the regression residuals suggests that the uncertainty of seawater pH reconstructed from $\delta$ 11B coral is ±0.07 to 0.12 pH units. This study demonstrates the applicability of $\delta$ 11B in D. dianthus to record ambient seawater pH and holds promise for reconstructing oceanic pH distribution and history using fossil corals. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Foraging by mammals is a complex suite of behaviors that can entail high energetic costs associated with supporting basal metabolism, locomotion and the digestion of prey. To determine the contribution of these various costs in a free-ranging marine mammal, we measured the post-dive oxygen consumption of adult Weddell seals (N=9) performing foraging and non-foraging dives from an isolated ice hole in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Dives were classified according to behavior as monitored by an attached video-data logging system (recording activity, time, depth, velocity and stroking). We found that recovery oxygen consumption showed a biphasic relationship with dive duration that corresponded to the onset of plasma lactate accumulation at approximately 23 min. Locomotor costs for diving Weddell seals increased linearly with the number of strokes taken according to the relationship: locomotor cost = –3.78+0.04 x stroke number (r2=0.74, N=90 dives), where locomotor cost is in ml O2 kg–1. Foraging dives in which seals ingested Pleuragramma antarcticum resulted in a 44.7{\%} increase in recovery oxygen consumption compared to non-foraging dives, which we attributed to the digestion and warming of prey. The results show that the energy expended in digestion for a free-ranging marine mammal are additive to locomotor and basal costs. By accounting for each of these costs and monitoring stroking mechanics, it is possible to estimate the aerobic cost of diving in free-ranging seals where cryptic behavior and remote locations prevent direct energetic measurements.},

abstract = {Rivers are the dominant source of many elements and isotopes to the ocean. But this input from the continents is not balanced by the loss of the elements and isotopes through hydrothermal and sedimentary exchange with the oceanic crust, or by temporal changes in the marine inventory for elements that are demonstrably not in steady state. To resolve the problem of the observed imbalance in marine geochemical budgets, attention has been focused on uncertainties in the hydrothermal and sedimentary fluxes. In recent Earth history, temporally dynamic chemical weathering fluxes from the continents are an inevitable consequence of periodic glaciations. Chemical weathering rates on modern Earth are likely to remain far from equilibrium owing to the physical production of finely ground material at glacial terminations that acts as a fertile substrate for chemical weathering. Here we explore the implications of temporal changes in the riverine chemical weathering flux for oceanic geochemical budgets. We contend that the riverine flux obtained from observations of modern rivers is broadly accurate, but not representative of timescales appropriate for elements with oceanic residence longer than Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles. We suggest that the pulse of rapid chemical weathering initiated at the last deglaciation has not yet decayed away and that weathering rates remain about two to three times the average for an entire late Quaternary glacial cycle. Taking into account the effect of the suggested non-steady-state process on the silicate weathering flux helps to reconcile the modelled marine strontium isotope budget with available data. Overall, we conclude that consideration of the temporal variability in riverine fluxes largely ameliorates long-standing problems with chemical and isotopic mass balances in the ocean.},

abstract = {Much of our knowledge of past ocean temperatures comes from the foraminifera Mg / Ca palaeothermometer. Several non-thermal controls on foraminifera Mg incorporation have been identified, of which vital-effects, salinity and secular variation in seawater Mg / Ca are the most commonly considered. Ocean carbonate chemistry is also known to influence Mg / Ca, yet this is rarely considered as a source of uncertainty either because (1) precise pH and [CO32−] reconstructions are sparse, or (2) it is not clear from existing culture studies how a correction should be applied. We present new culture data of the relationship between carbonate chemistry for the surface-dwelling planktic species Globigerinoides ruber, and compare our results to data compiled from existing studies. We find a coherent relationship between Mg / Ca and the carbonate system and argue that pH rather than [CO32−] is likely to be the dominant control. Applying these new calibrations to datasets for the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) and Eocene–Oligocene Transition (EOT) enable us to produce a more accurate picture of surface hydrology change for the former, and a reassessment of the amount of subtropical precursor cooling for the latter. We show that properly corrected Mg / Ca and $\delta$18O datasets for the PETM imply no salinity change, and that the amount of precursor cooling over the EOT has been previously underestimated by ∼ 2 °C based on Mg / Ca. Finally, we present new laser-ablation data of EOT-age Turborotalia ampliapertura from St Stephens Quarry (Alabama), for which a solution ICPMS Mg / Ca record is available (Wade et al., 2012). We show that the two datasets are in excellent agreement, demonstrating that fossil solution and laser-ablation data may be directly comparable. Together with an advancing understanding of the effect of Mg / Casw, the coherent picture of the relationship between Mg / Ca and pH that we outline here represents a step towards producing accurate and quantitative palaeotemperatures using this proxy.},

The isotopic composition of seawater for both systems plays a central role in these studies and is an important interlaboratory standard. Given the long residence times of both elements (similar to 10(7) years) it is commonly assumed that seawater is isotopically homogenous for these systems, yet no systematic studies currently exist. Here we present the B and Mg isotopic composition of 26-28 seawater samples from a number of ocean basins that encompass a significant range in salinity (32 to 38 psu), temperature (-0.3 to +25.9 degrees C) and water depth (0 to 1240 m). We find no significant or systematic variation for either system in accordance with their long residence times. We recommend that the mean values we report (delta(11)B = 39.61 +/- 0.04 parts per thousand (2 s.e.; n = 28), delta(25)Mg = -0.43 +/- 0.01 parts per thousand (2 s.e.; n = 26), delta(26)Mg = -0.82 +/- 0.01 parts per thousand (2 s.e.; n = 26)) be used in future studies involving Mg and B isotopes.},

abstract = {Many insects have an innate propensity to approach conspicuous objects. We explore how such beacon aiming determines the shape of a wood ant's habitual route. We find that a single large black cylinder within an arena biases the route taken by ants as they run from a start position at one end of the arena to reach a feeder at the other. Ants learn a stable route with the first segment of their trajectory aimed at the cylinder, which becomes an intermediate goal on the way to the feeder. When in occasional tests the cylinder is removed or displaced, ants head for the usual site of the cylinder. They also aim for the same site when the cylinder is removed and the ant's normal start position is changed. This behaviour suggests that visual features of the arena are learnt from the vantage point of the cylinder and that this stored snapshot guides the ant to that site. Ants thus reinforce their ability to reach the cylinder by learning other visual features in their surroundings that can also steer them to its location. The use of beacon aiming in fixing routes has several benefits. Because the same path will be traversed on every trial, beacon aiming facilitates the acquisition of routes. Beacon aiming also increases the robustness of learnt routes: ants straying from the route will be attracted to the closest beacon and so regain their habitual paths.},

These developments constitute the second revolution in the field since the invention of the atom probe in 1967 and atom probe tomography in 1973: the invention of the three-dimensional atom probe was the first revolution. This article seeks to put this second revolution into historical perspective by recounting the essential developments that led to this point. In particular, the role of Erwin Muller, the inventor of the atom probe and related instruments, is highlighted. From the invention of the field emission electron microscope to the field ion microscope to the atom probe and beyond, he created a field of microscopy that is thriving today. Next, the state of the art in atom probe instrumentation is illustrated with a current application. Finally, a brief look toward future developments is provided, which may include superconducting detectors and integration of atom probes with transmission electron microscopes.},

abstract = {Adsorption of cationic and anionic surfactants on carbonate materials is investigated in this study. Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) are chosen as typical cationic and anionic surfactants, respectively. It is found that the cationic CPC exhibits negligible adsorption on synthetic calcite in deionized water compared with the adsorption of the anionic SDS. However, a substantial amount of adsorption of CPC is observed on natural carbonates, such as dolomite and limestone. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that that a substantial amount of silicon and aluminum exists in natural dolomite and limestone but not in synthetic calcite. The adsorption plateau of CPC on carbonates highly depends on the silicon composition in the carbonate samples due to the strong electrostatic interaction between CPC and negative binding sites in silica and/or clay. The adsorption of CPC on natural carbonates is reduced in the presence of 1 atm CO2 compared with the case under 1 atm air, while SDS precipitates out of the solution under 1 atm CO2 due to its intolerance to divalent ions released from the carbonate surface as a result of CO2 acidification. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The Mg/Ca ratio of foraminiferal calcite is a widely accepted and applied empirical proxy for ocean temperature. The analysis of foraminifera preserved in ocean sediments has been instrumental in developing our understanding of global climate, but the mechanisms behind the proxy are largely unknown. Analogies have been drawn to the inorganic precipitation of calcite, where the endothermic substitution of Mg for Ca is favoured at higher temperatures. However, evidence suggests that foraminiferal Mg incorporation may be more complex: foraminiferal magnesium is highly heterogeneous at the sub-micron scale, and high Mg areas coincide with elevated concentrations of organic molecules, Na, S and other trace elements. Fundamentally, the incorporation mode of Mg in foraminifera is unknown. Here we show that Mg is uniformly substituted for Ca within the calcite mineral lattice. The consistency of Mg-specific X-ray spectra gathered from nano-scale regions across the shell ('test') reveals that the coordination of Mg is uniform. The similarity of these spectra to that produced by dolomite shows that Mg is present in an octahedral coordination, ideally substituted for Ca in a calcite crystal structure. This demonstrates that Mg is heterogeneous in concentration, but not in structure. The degree of this uniformity implies the action of a continuous Mg incorporation mechanism, and therefore calcification mechanism, across these compositional bands in foraminifera. This constitutes a fundamental step towards a mechanistic understanding of foraminiferal calcification processes and the incorporation of calcite-bound palaeoenvironment proxies, such as Mg. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {With the realization that many calcified skeletons form by processes involving a precursor phase of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), a new paradigm for mineralization is emerging. There is evidence the Mg content in biogenic ACC is regulated by carboxylated (acidic) proteins and other macromolecules, but the physical basis for such a process is unknown. We test the hypothesis that ACC compositions express a systematic relationship to the chemistry of carboxyl-rich biomolecules. A series of inorganic control experiments were conducted to establish the dependence of Mg/Ca ratios in ACC on solution composition. We then determined the influence of a suite of simple carboxylated organic acids on Mg content. Molecules with a strong affinity for binding Ca compared with Mg promote the formation of Mg-enriched ACC that is compositionally equivalent to high-magnesium calcites and dolomite. Measurements show Mg/Ca ratios are controlled by a predictable dependence upon the binding properties of the organic molecules. The trend appears rooted in the conformation and electrostatic potential topology of each molecule, but dynamic factors also may be involved. The dependence suggests a physical basis for reports that specific sequences of calcifying proteins are critical to modulating mineralization. Insights from this study may provide a plausible explanation for why some biogenic carbonates and carbonaceous cements often contain higher Mg signatures than those that are possible by classical crystal growth processes. The findings reiterate the controls of microenvironment on mineralization and suggest an origin of compositional offsets, or vital effects, long recognized by the paleoclimate community.},

Here, we use a particular (repeated training and displacement) paradigm, in which homebound ants are made to follow a familiar landmark route repeatedly from the feeder to the nest, even after they have arrived at the nest. The results show that during the repeated landmark-guided home runs the ant's path integrator runs continually, so that the current state of the homebound vector increasingly exceeds the reference state. The dramatic result is that the homing ants run away from home. This finding implies that the ants do not rely on cartographic information about the locations of nest and feeder (e.g. that the nest is always south of the feeder), but just behave according to what the state of their egocentric path integrator tells them.},

abstract = {BEFORE the deregulation of sheep scab control measures (Sheep Scab [National Dip] Order 1990) in July 1992, the combination of summer and autumn plunge dipping of all sheep for one minute in propetamphos, diazinon or flumethrin solutions, the licensing of markets, and the statutory restriction of movement of sheep out of infected areas maintained the annual incidence of sheep scab in the UK at less than 100 outbreaks per year. Plunge dipping may involve considerable animal handling and can prove expensive; it also raises concerns about operator safety and environmental contamination. Many shepherds and farmers, therefore, no longer annually plunge dip their sheep. Some rely on systemic endectocides for sheep scab control, but nowadays many do not actively prevent the disease in their flocks. The result is that, in areas with dense sheep populations, large numbers of animals are at risk of potentially severe disease. This article argues that the way forward for controlling sheep scab is to adopt a collaborative approach, rather than rely on the efforts of individual farms, which are all too often unsuccessful.},

abstract = {The sharing and collective processing of information by certain insect societies is one of the reasons that they warrant the superlative epithet 'super-organisms' (Franks 1989, Am. Sci. 77, 138-145). We describe a detailed experimental and mathematical analysis of information exchange and decision-making in, arguably, the most difficult collective choices that social insects face: namely, house hunting by complete societies. The key issue is how can a complete colony select the single best nest-site among several alternatives? Individual scouts respond to the diverse information they have personally obtained about the quality of a potential nest-site by producing a recruitment signal. The colony then deliberates over (i.e. integrates) different incoming recruitment signals associated with different potential nest-sites to achieve a well-informed collective decision. We compare this process in honeybees and in the ant Leptothorax albipennis. Notwithstanding many differences - for example, honeybee colonies have 100 times more individuals than L. albipennis colonies - there are certain similarities in the fundamental algorithms these societies appear to employ when they are house hunting. Scout honeybees use the full power of the waggle dance to inform their nest-mates about the distance and direction of a potential nest-site (and they indicate the quality of a nest-site indirectly through the vigour of their dance), and yet individual bees perhaps only rarely make direct comparisons of such sites. By contrast, scouts from L. albipennis colonies often compare nest-sites, but they cannot directly inform one another of their estimation of the quality of a potential site. Instead, they discriminate between sites by initiating recruitment sooner to better ones. Nevertheless, both species do make use of forms of opinion polling. For example, scout bees that have formerly danced for a certain site cease such advertising and monitor the dances of others at random. That is, they act without prejudice. They neither favour nor disdain dancers that advocate the site they had formerly advertised or the alternatives. Thus, in general the bees are less well informed than they would be if they systematically monitored dances for alternative sites rather than spending their time reprocessing information they already have. However, as a result of their lack of prejudice, less time overall will be wasted in endless debate among stubborn and potentially biased bees. Among the ants, the opinions of nest-mates are also pooled effectively when scouts use a threshold population of their nest-mates present in a new nest-site as a cue to switch to more rapid recruitment. Furthermore, the ants' reluctance to begin recruiting to poor nest-sites means that more time is available for the discovery and direct comparison of alternatives. Likewise, the retirement of honeybee scouts from dancing for a given site allows more time for other scouts to find potentially better sites. Thus, both the ants and the bees have time-lags built into their decision-making systems that should facilitate a compromise between thorough surveys for good nest-sites and relatively rapid decisions. We have also been able to show that classical mathematical models can illuminate the processes by which colonies are able to achieve decisions that are relatively swift and very well informed.},

abstract = {Indian Summer Monsoon {\{}(ISM){\}} indices are characterized by large secular variation during both glacials and interglacials. Although much information about palaeomonsoon intensity is derived from such indicies, current data sets do not relate simply to precipitation. In order to directly constrain the variability of {\{}ISM{\}} freshwater flux to the Bay of Bengal, we report {\{}Ba/Ca{\}} {\{}LA-ICPMS{\}} data of the surface-dwelling foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber from core {\{}RC12–343{\}} (central Bay of Bengal) between 68 and 47 ka. Planktic foraminifera {\{}Ba/Ca{\}} directly relates to seawater {\{}Ba/Ca,{\}} in turn principally controlled by freshwater flux. Our foraminifera-derived record for the central Bay of Bengal is highly coherent with that derived from O measurements of the same material, implying that these reconstructions are not significantly biased by potential shifts in . Validating this method allows us to produce a freshwater stack for the last 80 ka for the Bay of Bengal, enabling the orbital controls on {\{}ISM{\}} precipitation to be examined for the first time. The highest freshwater flux in the last 80 ka was {\{}∼3X{\}} larger than present and occurred during the early-mid Holocene. We show that the orbital timing of this record is best explained by a combination of factors with a weighting of ∼45{\%} given to the {\{}30{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}N-equator{\}} mean summer insolation gradient and ∼55{\%} given to the variability of {\{}May–July{\}} insolation at the equator and {\{}June–July{\}} insolation at {\{}30{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}N.{\}} These processes are consistent with current mechanistic understanding of {\{}ISM{\}} forcings and demonstrate a dominant orbital control on monsoon precipitation amount on millennial timescales.},

abstract = {The source of whitings on the Great Bahama Bank and their relationship to major changes in the chemistry of Bank waters have been among the longest and most hotly debated topics in carbonate geochemistry. In this paper, we demonstrate that the reaction kinetics of calcite with Bank waters for a given saturation state are similar to, but somewhat slower (2 to 3 times) than with Gulf Stream water. The interpretation of the reaction kinetics of suspended Bank sediment with Bank water requires that the precipitating phase be about twice as soluble as aragonite. Good agreement at equivalent saturation states was found between experimental precipitation rates and those calculated for the rate of change of Bank water chemistry in the region of whitings. These results indicate that the dominant mode of carbonate removal is via precipitation on resuspended sediments rather than the rapid pseudo-homogeneous precipitation of calcium carbonate in the water column resulting in the formation of a whiting. Estimates indicate that single aragonite needles may be resuspended many times over a period of decades during which they experience repeated overgrowth. A major portion ({\textgreater}98{\%}) of suspended calcium carbonate is outside the visually dramatic whitings. Thus, as visually spectacular as they are, whitings do not represent a short-term locally massive precipitation of carbonate on the Great Bahama Bank, nor are they even likely to be the dominant sites of carbonate removal in this region. Although future refinements are needed that include seafloor processes, we have at this point arrived at a mechanistic kinetic model that provides a reasonably quantitative explanation for the hydrochemistry of the carbonate system on the northern Great Bahama Bank. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The problem of scaling, which one finds in industrial heat exchangers, particularly in atmospheric coolers in nuclear power stations, depends on calcium carbonate deposits from fresh water. To better understand this phenomenon, we have examined the eventual implication of superficial electric charge of precipitated crystal nuclei. After a bibliographical review showing a fundamental divergence from already published results, this paper describes an experimental plant to measure the zeta potential in controlled conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium, oversaturation, or undersaturation of a CaCO3-H2O-CO2 system taking into account simultaneously the three phases: gas, liquid, and solid. The zeta potential is measured by a crystalline-plug method with calcite or aragonite crystals. The potential cancels at thermodynamic equilibrium and is always negative for other conditions, in particular for oversaturation where the possibility of scaling exists. The analysis of these results suggests that the potential determining ions of the system are Ca2+ and HCO-3. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As part of a research programme designed to identify biological agents for the control of sheep scab, the pathogenicity of the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae to Psoroptes mites in the presence of sheepskin and wool was examined in the laboratory. No inhibitory effects of skin and wool were observed and high levels of infection were recorded. Subsequently the pathogenicity of formulations of both M. anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana to Psoroptes ovis was studied in vivo. For this, 36 batches of 20 adult female Psoroptes mites were confined in 25 mm diameter chambers which were attached to the backs of 6 scab-naive sheep. In some treatments, mites were exposed to the fungal pathogens for 48 h in vitro prior to being placed on the host, while other treatments involved mites with no prior exposure placed directly onto the skin of a host treated with a fungal pathogen. After 48 h on the host, mites were removed, incubated individually and all fungal infections were recorded. Fungal infection was observed in all treatments, except untreated controls. However, B. bassiana infected a significantly greater number of mites than M. anisopliae with all the formulations examined. Infection rates were highest when mites were exposed to dry conidia ({\textgreater}90{\%}) and lowest with M. anisopliae in diatomaceous earth. Overall, the infection rate was not affected by whether or not the mites were given prior exposure to the conidia, before being placed on the sheep. The results demonstrate that Psoroptes mites can become infected by entomopathogenic fungi on the skin of sheep and provides a first demonstration of the potential of this technology for the control of sheep scab. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Pollen dispersal has been recently focused on as a major issue in the risk assessment of transgenic crop plants. The shape of the pollen dispersal of individual plants is hard to determine since a very large number of plants must be monitored in order to track rare longdistance dispersal events. Conversely, studies using large plots as a pollen source provide a pollen distribution that depends on the shape of the source plot. We report here on a method based on the use of Fourier transforms by which the pollen dispersal of a single, average individual can be obtained from data using large plots as pollen sources, thus allowing the estimation of the probability of long-distance dispersal for single plants. This method is subsequently implemented on simulated data to test its susceptibility to random noise and edge effects. Its conditions of application and value for use in ecological studies, in particular risk assessment of the deliberate release of transgenic plants, are discussed.},

The work is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication. Worldwide, coral reef ecosystems are experiencing increasing pressure from a variety of anthropogenic perturbations including ocean warming and acidification, increased sedimentation, eutrophication, and overfishing, which could shift reefs to a condition of net calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) dissolution and erosion. Herein, we determine the net calcification potential and the relative balance of net organic carbon metabolism (net community production; NCP) and net inorganic carbon metabolism (net community calcification; NCC) within 23 coral reef locations across the globe. In light of these results, we consider the suitability of using these two metrics developed from total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) measurements collected on different spatiotemporal scales to monitor coral reef biogeochemistry under anthropogenic change. All reefs in this study were net calcifying for the majority of observations as inferred from alkalinity depletion relative to offshore, although occasional observations of net dissolution occurred at most locations. However, reefs with lower net calcification potential (i.e., lower TA depletion) could shift towards net dissolution sooner than reefs with a higher potential. The percent influence of organic carbon fluxes on total changes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (i.e., NCP compared to the sum of NCP and NCC) ranged from 32{\%} to 88{\%} and reflected inherent biogeochemical differences between reefs. Reefs with the largest relative percentage of NCP experienced the largest variability in seawater pH for a given change in DIC, which is directly related to the reefs ability to elevate or suppress local pH relative to the open ocean. This work highlights the value of measuring coral reef carbonate chemistry when evaluating their susceptibility to ongoing global environmental change and offers a baseline from which to guide future conservation efforts aimed at preserving these valuable ecosystems.},

abstract = {Recently, a novel "electrogenic" type of sulfur oxidation has been documented in marine sediments, whereby long filamentous cable bacteria are generating electrical currents over centimeter-scale distances. Here we propose a numerical model description that is capable of quantitatively simulating the solute depth profiles and biogeochemical transformations in such electro-active marine sediments. The model is based on a conventional reactive transport description of marine sediments, which is extended with a new model formulation for the long-distance electron transport induced by the cable bacteria. The mechanism of electron hopping is implemented to describe the electron transport along the longitudinal axis of the microbial filaments. We demonstrate that this model is capable of reproducing the observed geochemical fingerprint of electrogenic sulfur oxidation, which consists of a characteristic set of O2, pH and H2S depth profiles. Our simulation results suggest that the cable bacteria must have a high affinity for both oxygen and sulfide, and that intensive cryptic sulfur cycling takes place within the suboxic zone. A sensitivity analysis shows how electrogenic sulfur oxidation strongly impacts the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur, iron, carbon and calcium in marine sediments.},

abstract = {The growth of calcium carbonate crystals has attracted growing attention as a model system for biomineralisation processes. Organic molecules and gelatinous matrices are known to play an essential role in the formation of hard tissues. For the investigation of the function of specific influence factors, a model experiment is necessary. Several hydrogels were previously tested as growth matrices for calcium carbonate. For laboratory experiments, a double diffusion set-up for the growth of crystals in gels was established earlier. Calcium carbonate crystals were grown in polyacrylamide hydrogels. Here the influence of the polymer content in the hydrogels on the crystallisation behaviour is reported. Time-resolved and spatially resolved crystallisation experiments were conducted. The collected calcium carbonate precipitates were analysed by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The morphology of the developing crystals was found to be dependent on the polymer content of the hydrogels. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{DePaolo2011,
abstract = {A surface reaction kinetic model is developed for predicting Ca isotope fractionation and metal/Ca ratios of calcite as a function of rate of precipitation from aqueous solution. The model is based on the requirements for dynamic equilibrium; i.e. proximity to equilibrium conditions is determined by the ratio of the net precipitation rate (Rp) to the gross forward precipitation rate (Rf), for conditions where ionic transport to the growing crystal surface is not rate-limiting. The value of Rp has been experimentally measured under varying conditions, but the magnitude of Rf is not generally known, and may depend on several factors. It is posited that, for systems with no trace constituents that alter the surface chemistry, Rf can be estimated from the bulk far-from-equilibrium dissolution rate of calcite (Rb or kb), since at equilibrium Rf=Rb, and Rp=0. Hence it can be inferred that Rf???Rp+Rb. The dissolution rate of pure calcite is measureable and is known to be a function of temperature and pH. At given temperature and pH, equilibrium precipitation is approached when Rp (=Rf-Rb)???Rb. For precipitation rates high enough that Rp???Rb, both isotopic and trace element partitioning are controlled by the kinetics of ion attachment to the mineral surface, which tend to favor more rapid incorporation of the light isotopes of Ca and discriminate weakly between trace metals and Ca. With varying precipitation rate, a transition region between equilibrium and kinetic control occurs near Rp???Rb for Ca isotopic fractionation. According to this model, Ca isotopic data can be used to estimate Rf for calcite precipitation. Mechanistic models for calcite precipitation indicate that the molecular exchange rate is not constant at constant T and pH, but rather is dependent also on solution saturation state and hence Rp. Allowing Rb to vary as Rp1/2, consistent with available precipitation rate studies, produces a better fit to some trace element and isotopic data than a model where Rb is constant. This model can account for most of the experimental data in the literature on the dependence of 44Ca/40Ca and metal/Ca fractionation in calcite as a function of precipitation rate and temperature, and also accounts for 18O/16O variations with some assumptions. The apparent temperature dependence of Ca isotope fractionation in calcite may stem from the dependence of Rb on temperature; there should be analogous pH dependence at pH{\textless}6. The proposed model may be valuable for predicting the behavior of isotopic and trace element fractionation for a range of elements of interest in low-temperature aqueous geochemistry. The theory presented is based on measureable thermo-kinetic parameters in contrast to models that require hyper-fast diffusivity in near-surface layers of the solid. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The advent of new microanalytical techniques such as electron microprobe mapping (EMP) and laser ablation microsamplers coupled to mass spectrometers (LA-ICP-MS) provides a new array of possibilities to explore in great detail the trace elements distribution in foraminiferal carbonates. Here we apply these techniques to characterize diagenetic phases present in foraminiferal shells from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1240 in the Panama Basin, a region characterized by the presence of manganese-rich minerals in the sediments. The combined application of these techniques allows us to characterize the elemental and spatial distribution on the surface and across the foraminiferal shells. Results illustrate the presence of at least two different Mn-rich contaminant phases in the foraminiferal carbonates: Mn-rich carbonates and ferromanganese oxides. Elemental maps also highlight the relevance of the foraminifera shell texture and porosity in the distribution and formation of these contaminant phases. In the case of Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Mn phases form a continuous thin layer in the inner part of the chambers, whereas for Globigerinoides ruber, Mn phases have a rather patchy distribution and are usually found within the pores. Significant high magnesium concentrations are always associated with these Mn-rich phases. These new findings support the need of removing these Mn-rich contaminant phases in order to measure accurately the Mg/Ca ratios in the foraminifera shell and therefore obtain reliable Mg/Ca paleotemperature reconstructions.},

abstract = {Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are causing ocean acidification1, 2, compromising the ability of some marine organisms to build and maintain support structures3 as the equilibrium state of inorganic carbon moves away from calcium carbonate4. Few marine organisms tolerate conditions where ocean pH falls significantly below today's value of about 8.1 and aragonite and calcite saturation values below 1 (refs 5, 6). Here we report dense clusters of the vent mussel Bathymodiolus brevior in natural conditions of pH values between 5.36 and 7.29 on northwest Eifuku volcano, Mariana arc, where liquid carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide emerge in a hydrothermal setting. We find that both shell thickness and daily growth increments in shells from northwest Eifuku are only about half those recorded from mussels living in water with pH{\textgreater}7.8. Low pH may therefore also be implicated in metabolic impairment7. We identify four-decade-old mussels, but suggest that the mussels can survive for so long only if their protective shell covering remains intact: crabs that could expose the underlying calcium carbonate to dissolution are absent from this setting. The mussels' ability to precipitate shells in such low-pH conditions is remarkable. Nevertheless, the vulnerability of molluscs to predators is likely to increase in a future ocean with low pH.},

abstract = {Precipitation of calcium compounds (phosphate and carbonate) was performed on chitosan porous and dense membranes. In order to observe the influence of acetyl groups on the nature of formed precipitates, some chitosan membranes were acetylated in methanol solution before undergoing calcification. Calcification experiments were performed more quickly than using SBF. In this method, a faster precipitation is induced by soaking the membranes in calcium chloride solutions and, in sequence, immersing the same membranes into sodium phosphate or carbonate solutions. This procedure induced the formation of calcium compound precipitates on membrane surfaces, which were analysed through optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflection apparatus (FTIR-ATR) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The results indicated the biomimetic influence of the organic matrix on morphology, organization and composition of precipitates. The acetyl group induced the formation of organized calcium carbonate better than phosphate, which may correlate with the fact that these two compounds are commonly found together in nature in structures like shells and nacre. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The primary root of Arabidopsis has a simple cellular organisation. The fixed radial cell pattern results from stereotypical cell divisions that occur in the meristem. Here we describe the characterisation of schizoriza (scz), a mutant with defective radial patterning. In scz mutants, the subepidermal layer (ground tissue) develops root hairs. Root hairs normally only form on epidermal cells of wild-type plants. Moreover, extra periclinal divisions (new wall parallel to surface of the root) occur in the scz root resulting in the formation of supernumerary layers in the ground tissue. Both scarecrow (scr) and short root (shr) suppress the extra periclinal divisions characteristic of scz mutant roots. This results in the formation of a single layered ground tissue in the double mutants. Cells of this layer develop root hairs, indicating that mis-specification of the ground tissue in scz mutants is uncoupled to the cell division defect. This suggests that during the development of the ground tissue SCZ has two distinct roles: (1) it acts as a suppressor of epidermal fate in the ground tissue, and (2) it is required to repress periclinal divisions in the meristem. It may act in the same pathway as SCR and SHR.},

It also explores policy approaches to tackle diffuse pollution, discussing when decisions are made, by whom, and how science can contribute. In doing this, the paper finally explores ways in which better knowledge exchange between researchers and the users of scientific information could improve the impact of research and the robustness of future policy development. In addition to policy-makers and operational staff in environmental agencies, new audiences for research on diffuse water pollution are emerging from the development of "bottom-up" integrated catchment management initiatives.

abstract = {Studies of hydrothermal circulation within partly buried basement on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge (JFR) have shown that ridge-flank geochemical fluxes are potentially important for the global budgets of some elements. There are major uncertainties in these flux calculations, however, because the composition of these basement fluids is strongly dependent on temperature and because they may be modified by interaction with the overlying terrigenous sediments, either by diffusive exchange with basement or during upwelling to the seafloor. To better understand the nature and temperature control of basalt-fluid and sediment-fluid reactions at the JFR flank, we have conducted laboratory experiments between 51 and 350??C and at 400 bars pressure. K, Rb, and Si are leached from basalt between 150 and 351??C, and Sr and U are taken up. The direction of exchange of Li and Ca with basalt varies with temperature. Li and Sr are removed from fluid at 150??C, but isotope studies show that there is simultaneous release of both elements from basalt, indicating that uptake is controlled by the formation of secondary minerals. Moreover, our experiments confirm that Sr isotope exchange with oceanic crust occurs at moderate temperature and is not confined to high-temperature axial hydrothermal systems. Our data and field data from the JDR flank indicate that uptake of U into basalt at moderate temperature could remove between 9.9 and 106mol U yr-1 from the oceans. This is higher than a recent estimate based on measurements of U in altered ocean crust (5.7 ?? 3.3 ?? 106 mol yr-1), which concords with arguments that the ??element/heat ratios of JDR flank fluids are too large to be representative of average global flank fluids. K, Ca, Sr, Ba, Li, Si, and B are leached from terrigenous sediments between 51 and 350??C, and U is taken up. Cs and Rb are removed from the fluid below 100??C and leached from the sediment at higher temperature. Sr isotope data show that Sr is preferentially mobilised from volcanic components within terrigenous sediments, which may lead to an overestimation of the ridge-flank Sr isotope flux at the JDR if there is exchange of sediment pore fluids with basement. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Small live individuals of Globigerinoides sacculifer which were cultured in the laboratory reached maturity and produced garnets. Fifty to ninety percent of their skeleton weight was deposited under controlled water temperature (14?? to 30??C) and water isotopic composition, and a correction was made to account for the isotopic composition of the original skeleton using control groups. Comparison of. the actual growth temperatures with the calculated temperature based on paleotemperature equations for inorganic CaCO3 indicate that the foraminifera precipitate their CaCO3 in isotopic equilibrium. Comparison with equations developed for biogenic calcite give a similarly good fit. Linear regression with Craig's (1965) equation yields: t = -0.07 + 1.01 t ?? (r= 0.95) where t is the actual growth temperature and t ?? Is the calculated paleotemperature. The intercept and the slope of this linear equation show that the familiar paleotemperature equation developed originally for mollusca carbonate, is equally applicable for the planktonic foraminifer G. sacculifer. Second order regression of the culture temperature and the delta difference (??18Oc - ??18Ow) yield a correlation coefficient of r = 0.95: t ?? = 17.0 - 4.52(??18Oc - ??18Ow) + 0.03(??18Oc - ??18Ow)2 t ??, ??18Oc and ??18Ow are the estimated temperature, the isotopic composition of the shell carbonate and the sea water respectively. A possible cause for nonequilibnum isotopic compositions reported earlier for living planktonic foraminifera is the improper combustion of the organic matter. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToFSIMS) is being applied increasingly to the study of biological systems where the chemical specificity of mass spectrometry and the high lateral resolution imaging capabilities can be exploited. Here we report a comparison of two cell sample preparation methods and demonstrate how they influence the outcome of the ToFSIMS analysis for three-dimensional (3D) imaging of biological cells using our novel buncher-ToF instrument (J105 3D Chemical Imager) equipped with a C60 primary ion beam. Cells were analysed fixed and freeze-dried and non-fixed, frozen-hydrated. It is concluded that maintaining the cells in a non-fixed frozen-hydrated state during the analysis helps reduce chemical redistribution, producing cleaner spectra and improved chemical contrast in both 2D and 3D imaging. Insights into data interpretation are included and we present methods for 3D reconstruction of the data using multivariate analysis techniques.

abstract = {Individual animals routinely face decisions that are crucial to their fitness. In social species, however, many of these decisions need to be made jointly with other group members because the group will split apart unless a consensus is reached. Here, we review empirical and theoretical studies of consensus decision making, and place them in a coherent framework. In particular, we classify consensus decisions according to the degree to which they involve conflict of interest between group members, and whether they involve either local or global communication; we ask, for different categories of consensus decision, who makes the decision, what are the underlying mechanisms, and what are the functional consequences. We conclude that consensus decision making is common in non-human animals, and that cooperation between group members in the decision-making process is likely to be the norm, even when the decision involves significant conflict of interest. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Experiments involving boron co-precipitation with calcite have been carried out inorganically under controlled pH conditions (7.9 ?? 0.05, 8.3 ?? 0.05 and 8.6 ?? 0.05) to determine the dependence of the boron isotopic composition (??11B) of calcite on the pH of seawater. Another purpose of these experiments was to estimate the magnitude of the biogenic influence on the ??11B value of foraminifera by comparing their boron isotopic composition with that of the inorganic calcite over a common pH range. The results show a clear relationship between ??11B of inorganic calcite and the pH of artificial seawater. The variation of boron isotopic fractionation between seawater and calcite with pH, estimated from these experiments, is similar to that estimated for cultured O. universa and the theoretically predicted trend. The results also support the hypothesis that B(OH)4
- is the dominant species incorporated into the calcite structure. However, the boron isotopic fractionation between seawater and inorganic calcite is lower than that estimated for O. universa indicating the presence of a biogenic effect on the boron isotopic composition at least of this species of foraminifera. Most importantly, the results imply that in spite of a small biogenic influence on the boron isotopic composition of foraminifera, the variation in ??11B of foraminifera shells with pH (at least for O. universa) is comparable to that for inorganic calcite, supporting the potential of this isotopic signature in foraminifera as a reliable paleo pH proxy.

@article{Veis2003,
abstract = {The primordial earth surface exposed minerals comprised mainly of carbonates, silicates and smaller amounts of phosphates. Weathering eventually led to the dissolution of the surface rock and the leaching of their components into the rivers, lakes and oceans. There, complex chemistry depending upon the temperature, pH, pressure, and atmospheric carbon dioxide content led to the reprecipitation of the dissolved minerals into new forms as part of the sedimentary rock. The minerals themselves could be transformed by passive diagenesis to further structures. When primitive organisms emerged, they added a very significant component to the processing of the dissolved mineral constituents in the marine environment, where both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms have the ability to produce mineralized skeletal elements and mineralized fecal pellets that also accumulate in the marine sediments. The increasing diversity of plant and animal life has continually accelerated the dynamic relationship between the composition of the earths crust and the living world. The resulting minerals of biogenic origin comprise a surprisingly large portion of the earths crust, and represent a huge reservoir of sequestered carbonate, silicate and phosphate ions. The majority of the carbonates appear as calcite or aragonite, produced principally by plankton, invertebrates and so on, while the phosphates, as carbonated hydroxyapatite, are the products of vertebrates as well as the weathering of igneous rock. This chapter is focused on the mechanisms of formation of the vertebrate mineralized structures; bone, tooth enamel, tooth dentin and otoliths. Although other Chapters deal explicitly with the invertebrate and bacterial systems, we need to consider if there are any general considerations that apply to all biogenic mineralization systems. We shall begin from that perspective and inquire as to the way by which living organisms can organize their mineral phases into such complex and specific structures. BIOMINERALIZATION:},

abstract = {Meiofaunal samples were collected from intertidal mudflats in the lower, middle and upper reaches of the Tamar estuary, South West England in April and October, 1982. Species abundance and biomass patterns of nematodes and copepods did not follow the expected trends in relation to salinity: the lowest species diversity (below neutral model predictions), the steepest ranked species abundance curves and the greatest departure from the theoretical lognormal distribution of numbers and biomass of individuals among species were found at the middle rather than the upper site. Huston's (1979) dynamic equilibrium hypothesis is invoked to explain these phenomena, but the hypothesis remains to be tested. Intense macrofaunal predation and disturbance, together with more pronounced environmental fluctuations, may eliminate competitive exclusion at the upper site result-ing in a relatively high species diversity. The absence of such population reduction mechanisms at the middle site results in competitive exclusion and lowered diversity. The major nematode species at the upper site have certain opportunistic characteristics, and at the middle site conservative characteristics, which support the contention that these are respectively successional and climax communities. The lower site may represent an intermediate successional stage with the highest diversity. The apparent correlation between the abundances of 3 copepod and 1 nematode species with changes in salinity at the middle and upper sites between April and October is thought to result from passive suspension and transport of these species upstream during the summer: there is a distinct fine-scale vertical stratifica-tion of species in the sediment at the middle site, with the species in question having an extreme surficial distribution.},

Here we report results that, together with those in the literature, show that DMSP and its breakdown products (DMS, acrylate, dimethylsulphoxide, and methane sulphinic acid) readily scavenge hydroxyl radicals and other reactive oxygen species, and thus may serve as an antioxidant system, regulated in part by enzymatic cleavage of DMSP. In support of this hypothesis, we found that oxidative stressors, solar ultraviolet radiation, CO(2) limitation, Fe limitation, high Cu(2+) (ref. 9) and H(2)O(2) substantially increased cellular DMSP and/or its lysis to DMS in marine algal cultures. Our results indicate direct links between such stressors and the dynamics of DMSP and DMS in marine phytoplankton, which probably influence the production of DMS and its release to the atmosphere. As oxidation of DMS to sulphuric acid in the atmosphere provides a major source of sulphate aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei, oxidative stressors--including solar radiation and Fe limitation--may be involved in complex ocean atmosphere feedback loops that influence global climate and hydrological cycles.},

abstract = {The geochemical composition of foraminiferal tests is a valuable archive for the reconstruction of paleo-climatic, -oceanographic and -ecological changes. However, dissolution of biogenic calcite and precipitation of inorganic calcite (overgrowth and recrystallization) at the seafloor and in the sediment column can potentially alter the original geochemical composition of the foraminiferal test, biasing any resulting paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The $\delta$11B of planktic foraminiferal calcite is a promising ocean pH-proxy but the effect of diagenesis is still poorly known. Here we present new $\delta$11B, $\delta$13C, $\delta$18O, Sr/Ca and B/Ca data from multiple species of planktic foraminifera from time-equivalent samples for two low latitude sites: clay-rich Tanzanian Drilling Project (TDP) Site 18 from the Indian Ocean containing well-preserved ('glassy') foraminifera and carbonate-rich Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 865 from the central Pacific Ocean hosting recrystallized ('frosty') foraminifera. Our approach makes the assumption that environmental conditions were initially similar at both sites so most chemical differences are attributable to diagenesis. Planktic foraminiferal $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C records show offsets in both relative and absolute values between the two sites consistent with earlier findings that these isotopic ratios are strongly influenced by diagenetic alteration. Sr/Ca and B/Ca ratios in planktic foraminiferal calcite are also offset between the two sites but there is little change in the relative difference between surface and deep dwelling taxa. In contrast, $\delta$11B values indicate no large differences between well-preserved and recrystallized foraminifera suggesting that despite extensive diagenetic alteration the $\delta$11B of biogenic calcite appears robust, potentially indicative of a lack of free exchange of boron between pore fluids and the recrystallizing CaCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. Our finding may remove one potential source of uncertainty in $\delta$11B based pH reconstructions and provide us with greater confidence in our ability to reconstruct pH in the ancient oceans from at least some recrystallized foraminiferal calcite. However, further investigations should extend this approach to test the robustness of our findings across a range of taphonomies, ages and burial settings. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.},

The formation of self-assembled film was analyzed by monitoring the morphologies using atomic force microscopy. Even more noteworthy, using anhydrous ethanol as media, the ACC-to-vaterite-to-calcite transformation was also investigated, and the obtained products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The results demonstrated that organic solvent has profound influence on transformation of amorphous calcium carbonate thin films. In the air of anhydrous ethanol, the controlled synthesis of calcium carbonate films with different morphologies, such as planar films with a few sporadic particles, symmetric rhombohedral crystals, novel crystals with symmetrical terraced convexity formation of calcite, was obtained by the fine-tuning of induction time.

Since Sr and Ca concentrations in seawater have not remained constant through time, interpretation of Sr/Ca data from the coccolith-dominated sedimentary record requires knowledge about the incorporation of seawater Sr into coccolith calcite during coccolithogenesis. Here we show that Sr/Ca of Emiliania huxleyi coccoliths is linearly related to seawater Sr/Ca, meaning that the Sr exchange coefficient does not change with changing seawater Sr/Ca. The exchange coefficient for Sr in this study, 0.39, is close to values presented in the literature and is high compared with values obtained by inorganic precipitation experiments. This suggests a strong effect of cell physiology on biogenic calcite precipitation in coccolithophores. We present a conceptual model, based on the transmembrane transport of Sr and Ca, which explains the offset.},

The aragonite is much less crystalline than non-biogenic aragonite. We further show that the initially deposited mineral phase is predominantly ACC that subsequently partially transforms into aragonite. The postset juvenile shell, as well as the adult shell of Mercenaria also contains aragonite that is less crystalline than non-biogenic aragonite.

Emiliania huxleyi CCMP 371 was cultured in four temperature and PCO2 treatments at both low and high irradiance (50 and 400 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)): (i) 20 degrees C and 375 ppm CO2 (ambient control); (ii) 20 degrees C and 750 ppm CO2 (high PCOA (iii) 24 degrees C and 375 ppm CO2 (high temperature); and (iv) 24 degrees C and 750 ppm CO2 ('greenhouse'). The growth of E. huxleyi was greatly accelerated by elevated temperature at low irradiance. Photosynthesis was significantly promoted by increases in both PCO2 and temperature at both irradiances. Higher cellular C/P ratios were found in the higher CO2 treatments at high irradiance, indicating a reduced requirement for P. The PIC/POC (particulate inorganic to organic carbon) ratio remained constant at low light, regardless of CO2 or temperature conditions. However, both the cellular PIC content and PIC/POC ratio were greatly decreased by elevated irradiance, and were further decreased by increased PCO2 only at high light, indicating a combined effect of CO2 and light on calcification. These results suggest that future trends of CO2 enrichment, sea-surface warming and exposure to higher mean irradiances from intensified stratification will have a large influence on the growth of Emiliania huxleyi, and potentially on the PIC/POC 'rain ratio'. Our study demonstrates that it is possible to obtain a more complete picture of global change impacts on marine phytoplankton by designing experiments that consider multiple global change variables and their mutual interactions.},

abstract = {Current interest in boron incorporation into carbonates arises from the observation that the isotopic composition of carbonates depends on the pH of the fluid from which they precipitated. This finding opened the possibility of using boron isotopic composition of natural carbonates as a paleo-pH proxy. In this study, coprecipitation of boron by calcite was investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), as a function of pH, supersaturation and boron concentration. In situ AFM observations reported here provide experimental evidence of boron incorporation into calcite, which takes place to a greater extent at high pH (9.5) and under close to equilibrium conditions. Moreover, we report nanoscale observations that give indirect evidence of the incorporation of boron in non-lattice sites. Step-specific interactions of tetrahedrally-coordinated boron with calcite obtuse steps during growth are revealed as a reduction in the obtuse-step spreading rate as well as rounding and roughening of such steps. Our results suggest that, together with changes in pH, variations in the calcification rate or the calcite crystallographic form in which boron is incorporated are important factors to consider when using boron in carbonates as a pH proxy, as these factors could also influence the amount of boron incorporated during growth and possibly the boron isotopic signature. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

2-. Independent work has shown that a tetrahedrally coordinated boron species is preferentially incorporated at the surface during growth, yet the boron in the bulk calcite is predominantly trigonally coordinated. Hence, there is a change in nearest-neighbor coordination of boron at the surface during incorporation. A possible explanation for the step-selective incorporation of boron lies in a surface-site control over the mechanism or rate of this coordination change. The findings demonstrate that multiple, structurally distinct surface anion sites exist on calcite {\{}1014{\}} faces, and inherent differences in these sites influence element incorporation and possibly surface kinetics. This behavior parallels the known differences for incorporation among surface cation sites and further confirms that trace and minor element partitioning is strongly affected by the structural aspects of mineral surfaces. Such site selectivity and associated effects on potential coordination changes may be intrinsic to crystal growth and impurity incorporation.},

Modulations of the flux of unradiogenic Sr from active margins over geologic time scales have to be considered as an additional driving force of change in the marine Sr isotope record, supplementing temporal variations in the submarine hydrothermal flux as a source of unradiogenic Sr to seawater. Such modulations can be driven by changes in the surface exposure of volcanic arc terrains, changes in climate, ocean currents and geographic latitude due to plate tectonics, as well as topographic changes that can affect local rainfall, runoff and erosion. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Anthropogenic elevation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO2) is making the oceans more acidic, thereby reducing their degree of saturation with respect to calcium carbonate (CaCO3). There is mounting concern over the impact that future CO2-induced reductions in the CaCO3 saturation state of seawater will have on marine organisms that construct their shells and skeletons from this mineral. Here, we present the results of 60 d laboratory experiments in which we investigated the effects of CO2-induced ocean acidification on calcification in 18 benthic marine organisms. Species were selected to span a broad taxonomic range (crustacea, cnidaria, echinoidea, rhodophyta, chlorophyta, gastropoda, bivalvia, annelida) and included organisms producing aragonite, low-Mg calcite, and high-Mg calcite forms of CaCO3. We show that 10 of the 18 species studied exhibited reduced rates of net calcification and, in some cases, net dissolution under elevated pCO2. However, in seven species, net calcification increased under the intermediate and/or highest levels of pCO2, and one species showed no response at all. These varied responses may reflect differences amongst organisms in their ability to regulate pH at the site of calcification, in the extent to which their outer shell layer is protected by an organic covering, in the solubility of their shell or skeletal mineral, and in the extent to which they utilize photosynthesis. Whatever the specific mechanism(s) involved, our results suggest that the impact of elevated atmospheric pCO2 on marine calcification is more varied than previously thought.},

abstract = {Oyster shell protein and polyaspartate bound to calcite have been visualized at the atomic and molecular levels by atomic force microscopy. The identities of potential binding sites have been suggested from atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and have been evaluated by molecular modeling. Energies and conformations of binding to (110) and (110) prism faces, (001) basal calcium planes, and (104) cleavage planes are considered. The interaction with the basal plane is strongest and is essentially irreversible. Binding to (110) prism surfaces is also energetically favored and selective for orientations parallel or perpendicular to the c-axis. Binding to (110) faces is significantly weaker and orientation nonspecific. If carboxyl groups of the protein or peptide replace select carbonate ions of the (110) face, the binding energy increases significantly, favoring binding in the parallel direction. Binding to (104) cleavage surfaces is weak and probably reversible. Specific alignment of oyster shell protein molecules on calcite surfaces is shown by AFM, and the relevance to the binding model is discussed.},

This unicellular coc-colithophorid alga is a useful model for mineralization because it produces calcified scales known as coccoliths in homogeneous cell culture.

The polyanions are synthesized in medial Golgi cisternae and co-aggregate with calcium ions into discrete 25 nm particles. PartMeqaden vesicles bud from cisternal margins and fuse with a coccolith-forming saccule con-taining an organic oval-shaped scale which forms the base of the future coccolith. The particles are localized on the base before the onset of mineral deposition and are present in the coccolith saccule throughout the period of crystal (CaCO3) nucleation and growth. During the final phase of coccolith formation, the particles disappear, and the mature crystals acquire an amorphous coat containing PS-1 and PS-2 polysaccharides which remain with the mineral phase after the coccoliths are extruded from the celt. Postulated mecha-nisms of polyanion-mediated mineralization are reviewed and their relevance to the calcification of coccoliths is addressed.},

abstract = {Mg-bearing calcite was precipitated at 25??C in closed system free-drift experiments from solutions containing NaHCO3, CaCl2 and MgCl2. The chemical and isotope composition of the solution and precipitate were investigated during time course experiments of 24-h duration. Monohydrocalcite and calcite precipitated early in the experiments ({\textless}8 h), while Mg-calcite was the predominant precipitate ({\textgreater}95{\%}) thereafter. Solid collected at the end of the experiments displayed compositional zoning from pure calcite in crystal cores to up to 23 mol{\%} MgCO3 in the rims. Smaller excursions in Mg were superimposed on this chemical record, which is characteristic of oscillatory zoning observed in synthetic and natural solid-solution carbonates of differing solubility. Magnesium also altered the predominant morphology of crystals over time from the {\{}104{\}} to {\{}100{\}} and {\{}110{\}} growth forms. The oxygen isotope fractionation factor for the magnesian-calcite-water system (as 103ln??Mg-cl-H2O) displayed a strong dependence on the mol{\%} MgCO3 in the solid phase, but quantification of the relationship was difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of the precipitate. Considering only the Mg-content and ??18O values for the bulk solid, 103ln??Mg-cl-H2O increased at a rate of 0.17 ?? 0.02 per mol{\%} MgCO3; this value is a factor of three higher than the single previous estimate (Tarutani T., Clayton R.N., and Mayeda T. K. (1969) The effect of polymorphims and magnesium substitution on oxygen isotope fractionation between calcium carbonate and water. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 33, 987-996). Nevertheless, extrapolation of our relationship to the pure calcite end member yielded a value of 27.9 ?? 0.02, which is similar in magnitude to published values for the calcite-water system. Although no kinetic effect as observed on 103ln??Mg-cl-H2O for precipitation rates that ranged from 103.21 to 104.60 ??mol ?? m-2 ?? h-1, it was impossible to disentangle the potential effect(s) of precipitation rate and Mg-content on 103ln??Mg-cl-H2O due to the heterogeneous nature of the solid. The results of this study suggest that paleotemperatures inferred from the ??18O values of high magnesian calcite ({\textgreater}10 mol{\%} MgCO3) may be significantly underestimated. Also, the results underscore the need for additional experiments to accurately characterize the effect of Mg coprecipitation on the isotope systematics of calcite from a chemically homogeneous precipitate or a heterogeneous material that is analyzed at the scale of chemical and isotopic zonation.

abstract = {Evidence suggests that patterns of benthic community structure are functionally linked to estuarine processes and physical characteristics of the benthos. To assess these linkages for coarse-sediment shorelines, we used a spatially nested sampling design to quantify patterns of distribution and abundance of both macroinfauna and macroepibiota. We examined replicate beach segments within a site (???1 km), sites within areas of relatively uniform salinity and temperature (???10 km), and areas (???100 km) in the two major basins of Puget Sound, Washington. Because slight variations in physical characteristics of a beach can lead to significant alterations in biota, we minimized confounding physical influences by working only in the predominant shoreline habitat type in Puget Sound, a mixture of sand, pebbles and cobbles. Species richness decreased steadily from north to south along gradients of declining wave energy, increasing temperature and decreasing salinity. A few taxa were confined to the South Basin, but many more were found in the North. Most of the variability in population abundance was captured at the smaller spatial scales. Physical conditions tend to become increasingly different with distance among sites. Communities became more different from north to south as species intolerant of more estuarine conditions dropped out. There was significant spatial autocorrelation among populations on neighboring beach segments for 73 of the 172 species sampled. Populations of these benthic species may be connected via dispersal on scales of at least km in Puget Sound. Our results strengthen prior conclusions about the strong linkages between the biota and physical patterns and processes in estuaries. It is important for monitoring and impact-detection studies to account for natural variation of physical gradients across the sampling scales used. Nested, replicated sampling designs can facilitate the detection of environmental change at spatial scales ranging from global (e.g., warming or El Ni??o), to regional (e.g., estuary-wide changes in salinity patterns), to local (e.g., from development at a site). ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The classical marine pelagic foodweb description was ascribed to the North Sea in the 1920s; phytoplankton production supports planktonic animals such as the copepod crustacean, Calanus, which in turn feed herring and other pelagic fish. Later studies have shown how organic material not consumed in the water column supplies benthic communities and demersal fish. This paper examines the pelagic ecosystems of the North Sea. They are stressed by: (1) fisheries pressure on higher trophic levels; (2) anthropogenic enrichment with nitrates and phosphates, which encourages the blooming of some types of phytoplankton; (3) climatic change; (4) input of toxins. Difficulties in obtaining and interpreting evidence of change are reviewed. Observational evidence of change can be supplemented by understanding the nature of the pelagic ecosystem and its links with physical conditions in different parts of the North Sea. Two regions of the North Sea are examined and compared. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Ongoing ocean acidification is widely reported to reduce the ability of calcifying marine organisms to produce their shells and skeletons. Whereas increased dissolution due to acidification is a largely inorganic process, strong organismal control over biomineralization influences calcification and hence complicates predicting the response of marine calcifyers. Here we show that calcification is driven by rapid transformation of bicarbonate into carbonate inside the cytoplasm, achieved by active outward proton pumping. Moreover, this proton flux is maintained over a wide range of pCO2 levels. We furthermore show that a V-type H+ ATPase is responsible for the proton flux and thereby calcification. External transformation of bicarbonate into CO2 due to the proton pumping implies that biomineralization does not rely on availability of carbonate ions, but total dissolved CO2 may not reduce calcification, thereby potentially maintaining the current global marine carbonate production.},

abstract = {While the elemental chemistry of marine mollusk shells contains valuable environmental information, extend- ing these interpretations to freshwater bivalve shells may be problematic, given the wide range of aqueous chemistries that exist in freshwater environments. To better understand the significance of these records, 20 bivalves were collected from four freshwater streams to determine the geochemical relationships that exist between the bivalve shell and their sources streams. The concentrations of manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and calcium (Ca) were analyzed by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry across the inner (INL) and outer nacreous layer (ONL) of each shell for comparison to stream data collected over the period of shell growth. Within an individual shell, the content of Mn, Sr, and Ba were significantly higher in the INL than the ONL, while Cu concentrations were similar. Strontium and Ba concen- trations co-varied between the two layers in 1:1 relation- ships, while Mn displayed a preferential enrichment in the INL that increased from 2:1 to 5:1 as the Mn content of the shell decreased. Each elemental profile can be correlated between shell layers, except for the trace element Cu, which appeared to be more closely related to the organic content of the shell. These results suggest that the major eochemistry of the shell layers differentially reflect the aqueous chemistry of the water in which a bivalve lived, but that these records are most likely overprinted by physiological processes specific to the mantle tissue from which a particular shell layer is secreted. Distribution coefficients (shellM/Ca:waterM/Ca, where M=trace element of interest) were calculated using the median molar elemental concentration for each shell (by layer), and the appropriate water concentration. Bivalves from a contam- inated site were excluded from this analysis because their shells were anomalous in size and color. For the remaining 15 shells, distribution coefficients (INL and ONL) were: Mn (0.50 and 0.21), Sr (0.26 and 0.17), and Ba (0.05: INL only). Inner nacreous layer values were comparable to the upper end of published estimates for freshwater bivalves and fish otoliths, while the ONL values were comparable to the lower range of values. Inclusion of shells from the contaminated site resulted in the calculation of distribution coefficients that fell outside the range of published estimates. These results suggest that exposure to pollutants may have a bearing on the biological factors that control the elemental concentration of bivalve shells in freshwater environments. While researchers generally avoid sampling shell material from the INL because of the potential for shell dissolution, the similarity in elemental profile trends observed here suggests that both the INL and ONL record accurate geochemical information, but in distinct forms. An obvious advantage of INL analysis is the relative increase in elemental concentration, but this is afforded at the expense of spatial resolution. Considered collectively, these results suggest that valuable information can be gleaned from the elemental concentration of freshwater bivalve shells when care is taken in the choice of material from which these records are extracted. element},

Results of a series of physical characterizations applied to reference skeletal materials reveal the inadequacy of this liquid-filled chamber model to account for structural and chemical properties of the shell building units. Simultaneously, these data provide convergent pieces of evidence for a specific mode of crystallization developed throughout various invertebrate phyla, supporting the hypothesized “common strategy” based on a multi-scaled control exerted on formation of their calcareous hard parts.},

abstract = {[1] We constructed a high-resolution Mg/Ca record on the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides sacculifer in order to explore the change in sea surface temperature (SST) due to the shoaling of the Isthmus of Panama as well as the impact of secondary factors like diagenesis and large salinity fluctuations. The study covers the latest Miocene and the early Pliocene (5.6-3.9 Ma) and was combined with delta O-18 to isolate changes in sea surface salinity (SSS). Before 4.5 Ma, SSTMg/Ca and SSS show moderate fluctuations, indicating a free exchange of surface ocean water masses between the Pacific and the Atlantic. The increase in delta O-18 after 4.5 Ma represents increasing salinities in the Caribbean due to the progressive closure of the Panamanian Gateway. The increase in Mg/Ca toward values of maximum 7 mmol/mol suggests that secondary influences have played a significant role. Evidence of crystalline overgrowths on the foraminiferal tests in correlation with aragonite, Sr/Ca, and productivity cyclicities indicates a diagenetic overprint on the foraminiferal tests. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analyses, however, do not show significantly increased Mg/Ca ratios in the crystalline overgrowths, and neither do calculations based on pore water data conclusively result in significantly elevated Mg/Ca ratios in the crystalline overgrowths. Alternatively, the elevated Mg/Ca ratios might have been caused by salinity as the delta O-18 record of Site 1000 has been interpreted to represent large fluctuations in SSS, and cultivating experiments have shown an increase in Mg/Ca with increasing salinity. We conclude that the Mg/Ca record {\textless} 4.5 Ma can only reliably be considered for paleoceanographical purposes when the minimum values, not showing any evidence of secondary influences, are used, resulting in a warming of central Caribbean surface water masses after 4.5 Ma of similar to 2 degrees C.},

O. umbonatus originated in the Late Cretaceous and remains extant, whereas N. umbonifera originated in the Eocene and is the closest extant relative to Nuttallides truempyi, which ranges from the Late Cretaceous through the Eocene. We measured B/Ca in both species in 35 Holocene sediment samples from the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern Oceans. B/Ca values in epifaunal N. umbonifera ({\~{}}85-175$\mu$mol/mol) are consistently lower than values reported for epifaunal Cibicidoides (Cibicides) wuellerstorfi (130-250$\mu$mol/mol), though the sensitivity of $\delta$[CO32-] on B/Ca in N. umbonifera (1.23±0.15) is similar to that in C. wuellerstorfi (1.14±0.048). In addition, we show that B/Ca values of paired N. umbonifera and its extinct ancestor, N. truempyi, from Eocene cores are indistinguishable within error. In contrast, both the B/Ca (35-85$\mu$mol/mol) and sensitivity to $\delta$[CO32-] (0.29±0.20) of core-top O. umbonatus are considerably lower (as in other infaunal species), and this offset extends into the Paleocene. Thus the B/Ca of N. umbonifera and its ancestor can be used to reconstruct bottom water $\delta$[CO32-], whereas O. umbonatus B/Ca appears to be buffered by porewater [CO32-] and suited for constraining long-term drift in seawater B/Ca. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Biomass and production of phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria were measured during July 1995 along 3 onshore-offshore transects in the NW Mediterranean Sea (Gulf of Lions). The trophic status of the investigated stations varied from weakly oligotrophic to mesotrophic. Two distinct groups of stations were separated when examining the relationships between primary producers, bacteria and nutrients. The 2 groups of stations exhibited a different relationship between the ratio of integrated bacterial production to integrated primary production (IBP/IPP) and IPP. However, there was no longer a difference between the 2 groups when taking into account the phytoplankton efficiency (PE/i.e. IPP in mg C m-2 h-1 divided by integrated chlorophyll in mg m-2) instead of IPP. Indeed, the most striking feature was a highly significant power fit of IBP/IPP versus PE, for a larger set of data collected in the Mediterranean Sea despite large differences in location, season, physical structure, nutrient and biological status of the stations (IBP/IPP = 25.1PE-0.68). For a large range of PE (i.e. higher than 1.0 mg C mg-1 chl h-1) the ratio remained below 25{\%}, but increased dramatically for lower values of PE. This relationship may help to explain the considerable variation (2 to 190{\%}) in bacterial production/primary production ratio previously found in the world's oceans.},

Photosynthate allocation to tree roots and their mycorrhizal fungi is hypothesized to fuel the active secretion of protons and organic chelators that enhance calcium dissolution at fungal-mineral interfaces. This was tested using (14)CO2 supplied to shoots of Pinus sylvestris ectomycorrhizal with the widespread fungus Paxillus involutus in monoxenic microcosms, revealing preferential allocation by the fungus of plant photoassimilate to weather grains of limestone and silicates each with a combined calcium and magnesium content of over 10 wt.{\%}. Hyphae had acidic surfaces and linear accumulation of weathered calcium with secreted oxalate, increasing significantly in sequence: quartz, granite {\textless} basalt, olivine, limestone {\textless} gabbro. These findings confirmed the role of mineral-specific oxalate exudation in ectomycorrhizal weathering to dissolve calcium bearing minerals, thus contributing to the geochemical carbon cycle.},

abstract = {The cornerstone of autotrophy, the CO(2)-fixing enzyme, d-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), is hamstrung by slow catalysis and confusion between CO(2) and O(2) as substrates, an "abominably perplexing" puzzle, in Darwin's parlance. Here we argue that these characteristics stem from difficulty in binding the featureless CO(2) molecule, which forces specificity for the gaseous substrate to be determined largely or completely in the transition state. We hypothesize that natural selection for greater CO(2)/O(2) specificity, in response to reducing atmospheric CO(2):O(2) ratios, has resulted in a transition state for CO(2) addition in which the CO(2) moiety closely resembles a carboxylate group. This maximizes the structural difference between the transition states for carboxylation and the competing oxygenation, allowing better differentiation between them. However, increasing structural similarity between the carboxylation transition state and its carboxyketone product exposes the carboxyketone to the strong binding required to stabilize the transition state and causes the carboxyketone intermediate to bind so tightly that its cleavage to products is slowed. We assert that all Rubiscos may be nearly perfectly adapted to the differing CO(2), O(2), and thermal conditions in their subcellular environments, optimizing this compromise between CO(2)/O(2) specificity and the maximum rate of catalytic turnover. Our hypothesis explains the feeble rate enhancement displayed by Rubisco in processing the exogenously supplied carboxyketone intermediate, compared with its nonenzymatic hydrolysis, and the positive correlation between CO(2)/O(2) specificity and (12)C/(13)C fractionation. It further predicts that, because a more product-like transition state is more ordered (decreased entropy), the effectiveness of this strategy will deteriorate with increasing temperature.},

The concentrations of DMS (61–18 665 nm) and DMSP (1978–54 381 nm) measured in mucus rope samples are the highest yet reported in the marine environment. The values exceed concentrations of DMS and DMSP reported from highly productive polar waters and sea ice algal communities. Concentrations of DMSP in coral mucus ranged from 1226 to 25 443 nm, with mucus from Acropora formosa containing the highest levels of DMSP. Dimethylsulphide and DMSP in surface microlayer samples from three coral reefs were two to four times subsurface (0.5 m) concentrations. In coral-reef sediment pore waters, concentrations of DMS and DMSP were substantially higher than water-column concentrations, suggesting that coral sediments may be a significant source of these two compounds to reef waters. Overall, the results strongly suggest that coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef are significant sources of these two sulphur substances.},

abstract = {Stable oxygen isotope ratios of foraminiferal calcite are widely used in paleoceanography to provide a chronology of temperature changes during ocean history. It was recently demonstrated that the stable oxygen isotope ratios in planktonic foraminifera are affected by changes of the seawater chemistry carbonate system: the ??18O of the foraminiferal calcite decreases with increasing CO3
2- concentration or pH. This paper provides a simple explanation for seawater chemistry dependent stable oxygen isotope variations in the planktonic foraminifera Orbulina universa which is derived from oxygen isotope partitioning during inorganic precipitation. The oxygen isotope fractionation between water and the dissolved carbonate species S = [H2CO3] + [HCO3
-] + [CO3
2-] decreases with increasing pH. Provided that calcium carbonate is formed from a mixture of the carbonate species in proportion to their relative contribution to S, the oxygen isotopic composition of CaCO3 also decreases with increasing pH. The slope of shell ??18O vs. [CO3
2-] of Orbulina universa observed in culture experiments is -0.0022??? (??mol kg-1)-1 (Spero et al., 1997), whereas the slope derived from inorganic precipitation is -0.0024??? (??mol kg-1)-. The theory also provides an explanation of the nonequilibrium fractionation effects in synthetic carbonates described by Kim and O'Neil (1997) which can be understood in terms of equilibrium fractionation at different pH. The results presented here emphasize that the oxygen isotope fractionation between calcium carbonate and water does not only depend on the temperature but also on the pH of the solution from which it is formed.},

abstract = {Whilst of lesser prevalence than B deficient soils, B-rich soils are important, causing B toxicity in the field and decreased crop yields in different regions of the world. The highest naturally occurring concentrations of soil B are in soils derived from marine evaporites and marine argillaceous sediment. In addition, various anthropogenic sources of excess B may increase soil B to levels toxic for plants. The most important source is irrigation water, but others include wastes from surface mining, fly ash, and industrial chemicals. Ameliorating high-B soils is extremely difficult. A commonly used method of reclaiming high B soils is to extensively leach with low B water. Though used successfully, leaching may not be a permanent solution and causes difficulties with the disposal of the leachates. Other amelioration methods include the use of soil amendments (e.g. lime, gypsum) and the planting of plant genotypes that are tolerant of high external B concentrations. Although there are various methods available to determine the levels of B in soils, soil analysis can provide little more than a general risk assessment for B toxicity. Similarly, diagnosing B toxicity in plants, either by visible symptoms or tissue analysis has limited applicability. Thus at present, neither soil nor plant analysis can be recommended to precisely predict the growth of plants on high soil B. Recent physiological and genetic studies have provided some understanding of genetic variation in the response of plants to high concentrations of B. Moreover, these studies have facilitated the breeding of tolerant genotypes for cultivation on high B soils. Considerable genetic variation in response to high B has been identified in a wide range of plant species, most of which share a similar tolerance mechanism – reduced uptake of B in both shoots and roots. The tolerance mechanism appears to be under the control of several major additive genes, and specific chromosomal locations have been identified for the genes in some species. Considerable success has been achieved in breeding for tolerance to B toxicity, a process that is greatly aided by the ease with which genotypic variation for this characteristic can be assessed and the range of methods available to screen breeding populations.},

We show that a simple hydrophilic peptide, with the same carboxyl-rich character as that of macromolecules isolated from sites of calcification, increases calcite Mg content by up to 3 mole percent. Comparisons to previous studies correlating Mg content of carbonate minerals with temperature show that the Mg enhancement due to peptides results in offsets equivalent to 7 degrees to 14 degrees C. The insights also provide a physical basis for anecdotal evidence that organic chemistry modulates the mineralization of inorganic carbonates and suggest an approach to tuning impurity levels in controlled materials synthesis.},

abstract = {The foraminifera Mg/Ca palaeothermometer contributes significantly to our understanding of palaeoceanic temperature variation. However, since seawater Mg/Ca has undergone large secular variation and the relationship between seawater and test Mg/Ca has not been calibrated in detail for any species with a substantial fossil record, it is only possible to assess relative temperature changes in pre-Pleistocene fossil samples. In order to establish the basis of accurate quantitative Mg/Ca-derived deep-time temperature reconstructions, we have calibrated the relationship between test Mg/Ca, seawater chemistry and temperature in laboratory cultures of the shallow-dwelling large benthic species Operculina ammonoides. Operculina has a fossil range extending back to the early Paleogene and is the nearest living relative of the abundant genus Nummulites. We find a temperature sensitivity of 1.7{\%}°C-1 and a linear relationship between the Mg distribution coefficient and seawater Mg/Ca (Mg/Casw) with m=-1.9×10-3, within error of the equivalent slope for inorganic calcite. The higher test Mg/Ca of O. ammonoides compared to inorganic calcite may be explained by an elevated pH of the calcifying fluid, implying that these foraminifera do not modify the Mg/Ca ratio of the seawater from which they calcify, differentiating them in this respect from most other perforate foraminifera. Applying these calibrations to previously published fossil data results in palaeo-Mg/Casw reconstruction consistent with independent proxy evidence. Furthermore, our data enable accurate absolute palaeotemperature reconstructions if Mg/Casw is constrained by another technique (e.g. ridge flank vein carbonate; fluid inclusions). Finally, we examine Li, Na, Sr and Ba incorporation into the test of O. ammonoides and discuss the control exerted by temperature, seawater chemistry, saturation state and growth rate on these emerging proxies.},

abstract = {In this research, means to increase the removal of natural organic matter (NOM) during drinking water treatment were investigated. Specifically, the modification of calcium carbonate surfaces by cationic polyelectrolytes was tested as a way to improve humic acid adsorption to floc surfaces during lime softening. Results demonstrated that under high pH conditions (pH 9.5), coating the particles with high charge density cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) significantly increased the adsorption of humic acid, while coating the particles with low charge density CPAM had no positive effect. The amount of humic acid adsorbed also depended on the molecular weight of CPAM, with high molecular weight coatings being more effective at enhancing adsorption than low molecular weight coatings. Electrophoretic mobility measurements demonstrated that the cationic polymer reduced repulsive electrostatic interactions between humic acid and the particle surface. Under low pH conditions (pH 7.5), adsorption of polyacrylamide was low, and coating the particles had less effect on the amount of humic acid adsorbed. The results presented here suggest that the modification of calcium carbonate floc surfaces using cationic polymers with high charge density may enhance natural organic matter removal during drinking water treatment.

The separation factor increased with a decrease in the boric acid concentration of external solution from 1.008 (0.501 mol/l) to 1.016 (0.010 mol/l). The value of the separation factors obtained experimentally were compared with those estimated on the basis of the theory of the two-phase distribution of isotopes.},

Throughout the oceans, the more abundant elements have near constant ratios to salinity (a measure of total dissolved salts). Thus, records of their past concentrations in sea-water should tell us how active these sources and sinks were over long time scales. However, reliable archives of past seawater chemistry have been difficult to find (1). On page 1114 of this issue, Coggon et al. address this problem by measuring magnesium/calcium and strontium/calcium ratios in calcium carbonate (calcite) veins recovered from ocean crust buried under sediments (2). Their Mg/Ca record for the past 180 million years agrees with previous work (1), but the Sr/Ca record does not (3). The results have implications not only for seawater chemistry but also for climate change.},

abstract = {Photosynthesis by marine phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean, and the associated uptake of carbon, is thought to be currently limited by the availability of iron. One implication of this limitation is that a larger iron supply to the region in glacial times could have stimulated algal photosynthesis, leading to lower concentrations of atmospheric CO2. Similarly, it has been proposed that artificial iron fertilization of the oceans might increase future carbon sequestration. Here we report data from a whole-ecosystem test of the iron-limitation hypothesis in the Southern Ocean, which show that surface uptake of atmospheric CO2 and uptake ratios of silica to carbon by phytoplankton were strongly influenced by nanomolar increases of iron concentration. We use these results to inform a model of global carbon and ocean nutrients, forced with atmospheric iron fluxes to the region derived from the Vostok ice-core dust record. During glacial periods, predicted magnitudes and timings of atmospheric CO2 changes match ice-core records well. At glacial terminations, the model suggests that forcing of Southern Ocean biota by iron caused the initial approximately 40 p.p.m. of glacial-interglacial CO2 change, but other mechanisms must have accounted for the remaining 40 p.p.m. increase. The experiment also confirms that modest sequestration of atmospheric CO2 by artificial additions of iron to the Southern Ocean is in principle possible, although the period and geographical extent over which sequestration would be effective remain poorly known.},

Deep-sea temperatures warmed by approximately 2 degrees C between 19 and 17 thousand years before the present (ky B.P.), leading the rise in atmospheric CO2 and tropical-surface-ocean warming by approximately 1000 years. The cause of this deglacial deep-water warming does not lie within the tropics, nor can its early onset between 19 and 17 ky B.P. be attributed to CO2 forcing. Increasing austral-spring insolation combined with sea-ice albedo feedbacks appear to be the key factors responsible for this warming.},

We tested the impact of early marine diagenesis on CAS by comparing the CAS extractions to the sulfur and oxygen isotope composition of the associated pore fluid sulfate, to determine the degree of pore fluid incorporation during carbonate recrystallization. Neither the sulfur nor the oxygen isotope composition of CAS are completely overprinted by incorporation of pore fluid sulfate. We compare our record to the sulfur and oxygen isotope records of coeval barite. The sulfur isotope record is in agreement with the barite record within ??2???, except where very young ({\textless}2 Ma) sediments are in the presence of highly evolved pore fluid sulfate (??S34=70???). A simple recrystallization model is used to illustrate the sensitivity of CAS ??SSO434 to sedimentation rate, and to emphasize that careful sample selection, along with an analysis of early diagenetic environmental conditions is crucial when interpreting CAS sulfur isotopes. Oxygen isotopes in CAS are more complex and do not reproduce similar values to those of coeval barite. We conclude that oxygen isotopes in sulfate may remain a useful proxy but merit closer attention in the future. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The isotopic ratio and concentration of B in foraminiferal calcite appear to reflect the pH and bicarbonate concentration of seawater. The use of B as a chemical proxy tracer has the potential to transform our understanding of the global carbon cycle, and ocean acidification processes. However, discrepancies between the theory underpinning the B proxies, and mineralogical observations of B coordination in biomineral carbonates call the basis of these proxies into question. Here, we use synchrotron X-ray spectromicroscopy to show that B is hosted solely as trigonal BO3 in the calcite test of Amphistegina lessonii, and that B concentration exhibits banding at the micron length scale. In contrast to previous results, our observation of trigonal B agrees with the predictions of the theoretical mechanism behind B palaeoproxies. These data strengthen the use of B for producing palaeo-pH records. The observation of systematic B heterogeneity, however, highlights the complexity of foraminiferal biomineralisation, implying that B incorporation is modulated by biological or crystal growth processes.},

abstract = {Total alkalinity (TA) is one of the few measurable quantities that can be used together with other quantities to calculate concentrations of species of the carbonate system (CO2, HCO3-, CO32-, H+, OH-). TA and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are conservative quantities with respect to mixing and changes in temperature and pressure and are, therefore, used in oceanic carbon cycle models. Thus it is important to understand the changes of TA due to various biogeochemical processes such as formation and remineralization of organic matter by microalgae, precipitation and dissolution of calcium carbonate. Unfortunately deriving such changes from the common expression for TA in terms of concentrations of non-conservative chemical species (HCO3-, CO32-, B(OH)4-, H+, OH-, etc.) is rarely obvious. Here an expression for TA (TAec) in terms of the total concentrations of certain major ions (Na+, Cl-, Ca2+ etc.) and the total concentrations of various acid-base species (total phosphate etc.) is derived from Dickson's original definition of TA under the constraint of electroneutrality. Changes of TA by various biogeochemical processes are easy to derive from this so-called explicit conservative expression for TA because each term in this expression is independent of changes of temperature or pressure within the ranges normally encountered in the ocean and obeys a linear mixing relation. Further, the constrains of electroneutrality for nutrient uptake by microalgae and photoautotrophs are discussed. A so-called nutrient-H+-compensation principle is proposed. This principle in combination with TAec allows one to make predictions for changes in TA due to uptake of nutrients that are consistent with observations. A new prediction based on this principle is the change in TA due to nitrogen fixation followed by remineralization of organic matter and subsequent nitrification of ammonia which implies a significant sink of TA in tropical and subtropical regions where most of the nitrogen fixation takes place. ?? 2007.},

Decreases in 234 Th activity with time in the fertilized mixed layer (0–50 m) exceeded those in unfertilized waters, indicating enhanced export of 234 for POC and bSiO2 out of the mixed layer by about 300{\%}.

The actual concentration of phosphate in phosphorus-limited waters is largely unknown because commonly used chemical and radiochemical techniques overestimate the concentration. Here, using a new steady-state radiobioassay to survey a diverse set of lakes, we report phosphate concentrations in lakes that are orders of magnitude lower than estimates made spectrophotometrically or with the frequently used Rigler radiobioassay. Our results, combined with those from the literature, indicate that microbes can achieve rapid turnover rates at picomolar nutrient concentrations. This occurs even though these concentrations are about two orders of magnitude below the level where phosphate uptake is estimated to be half the saturation level for the pico-plankton community. Also, while phosphate concentration increased with the concentration of total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus in the lakes we sampled, the proportion of phosphate in the total phosphorus pool decreased from oligotrophic to eutrophic lakes. Such information, as revealed by the phosphate assay that we use here, should allow us to address hypotheses concerning the concentration of phosphate available to planktonic microorganisms in aquatic systems.},

In contrast to previous experiments on Mg partitioning into calcite, here the layer-growth mechanism was observed in situ and step speeds precisely measured with fluid cell atomic force microscopy over a range of temperatures, degrees of supersaturation, and solution Mg concentrations. Data collected from 15° to 30°C yield an activation energy for calcite precipitation of 33 kJ/mol for solutions with [Mg] = 5 × 10-5 molal. Electron microprobe analyses of large hillocks grown at corresponding conditions demonstrate that Mg has a strong preference for incorporation at negative (acute) step edges, rather than at positive (obtuse) edges when growth rate is limited by surface reactions. This preference is reversed when growth is instead limited by diffusion of reactants through a boundary layer at the mineral-solution interface. These findings show that temperature is not the only strong control on the extent of Mg incorporation and distribution in calcite; transport conditions during mineral growth may also be a first-order factor governing the compositions of natural calcite samples.

abstract = {1. Little is known about the pollinators of rare plants, which is cause for concern given that pollination is essential for the long-term survival of most plant species. The aim of this study was to determine the probable pollinators of three species of rare arable weed: red hemp-nettle Galeopsis angustifolia, small-flowered catchfly Silene gallica and spreading hedge-parsley Torilis arvensis. Species of arable weed are among those suffering the greatest declines in the UK. 2. Five field sites were chosen, two of which were sampled in 2 years. Visitation and pollen transport webs were constructed for the entire plant-pollinator community at each site. Visitation webs described the frequency with which each insect species visited each plant species. Pollen transport webs quantified which insect species transported the pollen of which plant species. 3. A wide range of insect species visited the three plant species. A pollinator importance index was calculated that combined information on both the relative abundance of each insect carrying the pollen of the rare plant and its pollen fidelity. Using this method Galeopsis angustifolia was most likely to be pollinated by Bombus pascuorum at one site and Sphaerophoria scripta at another. Silene gallica was also likely be pollinated by Sphaerophoria scripta. 4. The pollinator fauna of the three plant species varied considerably across their geographical range, but less from one year to the next. 5. Synthesis and applications. All three species of rare plant were linked to other plant species in the community by shared pollinators. In many cases these other plant species constituted the primary food sources for the shared pollinators. Therefore, the long-term survival of rare plant populations is likely to depend on the more common plant species in the community. We recommend that management of the rare plants studied here should also include the protection and management of populations of some of the more common plant species in their respective communities.},

After a temperature-dependent induction time, during stage 2 the Mg-ACC partially dehydrates and orders prior to its rapid ({\textless}5 min) crystallization to non-stoichiometric proto-dolomite. This occurs via the dissolution of Mg-ACC, followed by the secondary nucleation of proto-dolomite from solution. The proto-dolomite crystallization proceeds via spherulitic growth that follows a growth front nucleation mechanism with a de-nuovo and continuous formation of nanocrystalline proto-dolomite subunits that form spherical aggregates. In stage three of the reaction, the proto-dolomite transforms to highly crystalline and stoichiometric dolomite on a much longer timescale (hours to days), via an Ostwald-ripening mechanism. Such a three-stage crystallization can explain microbially induced proto-dolomites observed in modern hypersaline settings and may also be the route by which the Cryogenian cap dolomite deposits of the Neoproterozoic formed.

abstract = {The review provides an overview of the features of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in their European geographical and socio-political context. To reach sustainability in the wider sense the common society has to meet the 7 tenets - that management actions have to be environmentally sustainable, economically viable, technologically feasible, socially desirable (or at least tolerable), legally permissible, administratively achievable and politically expedient. Each of these are explained and discussed using examples from the two seas including pollution control, physical resource exploitation (such as aggregates, habitat loss, renewable energy and oil and gas), and biological resources exploitation (fisheries and aquaculture). This paper discusses the similarities between the areas in terms of their management regimes, population in the catchment, history of anthropogenic changes, derivation of objectives against a wealth of information and understanding, and the history of management and control. In contrast, the differences between the areas centre on their differing hydrographic regimes, including residence and flushing times, biological features, nature of the pollutants discharged, dominant types of fishing and type of control indicated by a predominant Eastern Bloc for the Baltic as opposed to European Union control in the North Sea. The review ends with an assessment of future challenges and examples of the way in which environmental problems have been addressed in the two areas. In particular, it sets the features against a background of management designed to achieve the Ecosystem Approach within the prevailing European marine management framework. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Within a single foraminiferal test from a core top sample comprising both ontogenetic calcite and outer crust, ??18O values vary from 0.5??? to 3.7??? [PDB], exceeding the range of equilibrium ??18O in the specimens' habitat by a factor of three. The isotopic difference between the ontogenetic calcite and the crust averages 1.8???. Neither of the two types of foraminiferal calcite precipitates in equilibrium with ambient seawater. The ontogenetic calcite exhibits a negative vital effect ??18O(M-E) (??18O(measured) - ??18O(equilibrium)) ranging from - 0.5 to - 1???. The largest negative fractionation is associated to the inner walls of juvenile chambers. In contrast, a positive vital effect of about 0.8??? was observed in the crust with respect to the highest equilibrium ??18O values at water depths below 200??m. Hence two vital effects that are opposite in sign are effective within a single foraminiferal test, indicating that 'whole test' values of this species are highly sensitive to the degree of encrustation and amplify or attenuate environmental signals. The negative vital effect of the ontogenetic calcite was verified by ion microprobe analysis of four nonencrusted net-sampled specimens reflecting three different depth intervals. Intra-ontogenetic oxygen isotope ratios in these juvenile tests range from 0.6 to 3.0??? and exhibit a negative vital effect even larger than that observed in core top samples. Based on these data, the large range of 'apparent' vital effects reported for this foraminiferal species can be assessed by a mass balance calculation, assuming that the degree of encrustation is variable. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Till date all the estimates about life span of planktonic foraminifers are based on the extrapolation of growth rates obtained in culture experiments and range from a few days to a few weeks, varying widely. Here the use of sediment trap technique is proposed to get much better estimates of life spans of planktonic foraminifers. On the basis of sediment trap results, it is hypothesized that in general the life spans of planktonic foraminiferal species are of the order of few months instead of few days to few weeks, as reported earlier.},

abstract = {Through the process of biomineralization living organisms use macromolecules to direct nucleation and growth of nanophases of a variety of inorganic materials. Evidence shows this is a widespread strategy for controlling the timing, polymorphism, morphology, and crystallographic orientation of CaCO3 nuclei. In the past decade, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols have been used as a simple model to reproduce the controls of organic substrates. However, despite the importance of nucleation phenomena in the crystallization of inorganic materials our understanding of the reaction dynamics is extremely limited because, until recently, there was no experimental tool that possessed the spatial and temporal resolution needed to capture the formative events in the process. Issues such as the formation of amorphous precursors, and polymorph selection during the initial stages of nucleation, as well as the structural relationships and energetic controls of the inorganic matrix on the emerging nucleus have not been fully explored. To address these gaps in our understanding we have developed a suite of in situ methods and applied them, along with synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopies, to CaCO3 nucleation. We used these methods to observe CaCO3 nucleation rates on alkanethiol SAMs. We found that for two carboxyl-terminated alkanethiol SAMs with odd (mercaptoundecanoic acid) and even (mercaptohexadecanoic acid) carbon chains, the effective interfacial energy is reduced from about 109 mJ m-2 in solution to 81 mJ m-2 and 72 mJ m-2, respectively, showing that templating is driven by a reduction in the thermodynamic barrier to nucleation. We also report in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of crystal nucleation and growth in solution at the nanometre scale and video rates. This capability is enabled by the combination of a custom designed TEM stage and fluid cell. Significantly, the design of the cell and holder ensures temperature and electrochemical control over the reaction environment, allowing for direct investigation of nucleation. Our first results show that CaCO3 nucleates via nanoparticles of an apparent metastable precursor- most likely ACC-followed by consolidation and faceting. Finally, we report insights from the use of synchrotron-based near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) into the evolution of the SAM during the nucleation process. Based on measurements of SAM monomer orientation, we argue that the ability of the SAM to reorganize during the nucleation process is a key feature of an organic matrix that successfully directs mineralization.},

We present Sr, O, and C isotopic data from river and rain water, bedload, and bedrock samples for the western and central Nepal Himalaya and Bangladesh, including the monsoon season. Central Himalayan rivers receive Sr from several sources: carbonate and clastic Tethyan sediments, High Himalayan Crystalline (HHC) gneisses and granitoids with minor marbles, carbonates and metasediments of the Lesser Himalaya (LH), and Miocene-Recent foreland basin sediment from the Siwaliks group and the modern flood plain. In the Tethyan Himalayan rivers have dissolved [Sr] {\~{}} 6 ??mol/l and 87Sr/86Sr {\~{}} 0.717, with a large condition from moderately radiogenic carbonate. Rivers draining HHC gneisses are very dilute with [Sr] {\~{}} 0.2 ??mol/l and 87Sr/86Sr {\~{}} 0.74. Lesser Himalayan streams also have low [Sr] {\~{}} 0.4 ??mol/l and are highly radiogenic (87Sr/86Sr ??? 0.78). Highly radiogenic carbonates of the LH do not contribute significantly to the Sr budget because they are sparse and have very low [Sr]. In large rivers exiting the Himalaya, Sr systematics can be modeled as a mixture between Tethyan rivers, where slightly radiologenic carbonates (mean 87Sr/86Sr {\~{}} 0.715) are the main source of Sr, and Lesser Himalaya waters, where extremely radiogenic silicates ({\textgreater}0.8) are the main source of Sr. HHC waters are less important because of their low [Sr]. Rivers draining the Siwaliks foreland basin sediments have [Sr] {\~{}} 4 ??mol/l and 87Sr/86Sr {\~{}} 0.725. Weathering of silicates in the Siwaliks and the flood plain results in a probably significant radiogenic (0.72-0.74) input to the Ganges and Brahmaputra (G-B), but quantification of this flux is limited by uncertainties in the hydrologic budget. The G-B in Bangladesh show strong seasonal variability with low [Sr] and high 87Sr/86Sr during the monsoon. Sr in the Brahmaputra ranges from 0.9 ??mol/l and 0.722 in March to 0.3 ??mol/l and 0.741 in August.

abstract = {A principal limitation of cryo-transmission electron microscopy performed on cells or tissues is the accessible specimen thickness. This is exacerbated in tomography applications, where the aspect ratio (and thus the apparent specimen thickness) changes considerably during specimen tilting. Cryo-ultramicrotomy is the most obvious way of dealing with this problem; however, frozen-hydrated sections suffer from potentially inconsistent compression that cannot be corrected with certainty, and furthermore, yields of sections that satisfy all of the conditions necessary for tomographic imaging are poor. An alternative approach that avoids mechanical deformations is the use of focused ion beam (FIB) instrumentation, where thinning of the frozen-hydrated specimen occurs through the process of sputtering with heavy ions, typically gallium. Here, we use correlative cryo-fluorescence microscopy to navigate large cellular volumes and to localize specific cellular targets. We show that the selected targets in frozen-hydrated specimens can be accessed directly by focused ion beam milling. We also introduce a novel cryo-planing procedure as a method that could facilitate thinning of large areas of vitreous ice prior to cryo-fluorescence, FIB thinning, and cryo-electron tomography. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In nature, proteins play a significant role in biomineral formation. One of the ultimate goals of bioinspired materials science is to develop highly stable synthetic molecules that mimic the function of these natural proteins by controlling crystal formation. Here, we demonstrate that both the morphology and the degree of acceleration or inhibition observed during growth of calcite in the presence of peptoids can be rationally tuned by balancing the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, with hydrophobic interactions playing the dominant role. While either strong electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions inhibit growth and reduces expression of the {\{}104{\}} faces, correlations between peptoid-crystal binding energies and observed changes in calcite growth indicate moderate electrostatic interactions allow peptoids to weakly adsorb while moderate hydrophobic interactions cause disruption of surface-adsorbed water layers, leading to growth acceleration with retained expression of the {\{}104{\}} faces. This study provides fundamental principles for designing peptoids as crystallization promoters, and offers a straightforward screening method based on macroscopic crystal morphology. Because peptoids are sequence-specific, highly stable, and easily synthesized, peptoid-enhanced crystallization offers a broad range of potential applications.},

abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity of U/Ca, Mg/Ca, and Sr/Ca to changes in seawater [CO32-] and temperature in calcite produced by the two planktonic foraminifera species, Orbulina universa and Globigerina bulloides, in laboratory culture experiments. Our results demonstrate that at constant temperature, U/Ca in O. universa decreases by 25 ± 7{\%} per 100 $\mu$mol [CO32-] kg-1, as seawater [CO32-] increases from 110 to 470 $\mu$mol kg-1. Results from G. bulloides suggest a similar relationship, but U/Ca is consistently offset by ∼+40{\%} at the same environmental [CO32-]. In O. universa, U/Ca is insensitive to temperature between 15°C and 25°C. Applying the O. universa relationship to three U/Ca records from a related species, Globigerinoides sacculifer, we estimate that Caribbean and tropical Atlantic [CO32-] was 110 ± 70 $\mu$mol kg-1 and 80 ± 40 $\mu$mol kg-1 higher, respectively, during the last glacial period relative to the Holocene. This result is consistent with estimates of the glacial-interglacial change in surface water [CO32-] based on both modeling and on boron isotope pH estimates. In settings where the addition of U by diagenetic processes is not a factor, down-core records of foraminiferal U/Ca have potential to provide information about changes in the ocean's carbonate concentration. Below ambient pH (pH {\textless} 8.2), Mg/Ca decreased by 7 ± 5{\%} (O. universa) to 16 ± 6{\%} (G. bulloides) per 0.1 unit increase in pH. Above ambient pH, the change in Mg/Ca was not significant for either species. This result suggests that Mg/Ca-based paleotemperature estimates for the Quaternary, during which surface-ocean pH has been at or above modern levels, have not been biased by variations in surface-water pH. Sr/Ca increased linearly by 1.6 ± 0.4{\%} per 0.1 unit increase in pH. Shell Mg/Ca increased exponentially with temperature in O. universa, where Mg/Ca = 0.85 exp (0.096*T), whereas the change in Sr/Ca with temperature was within the reproducibility of replicate measurements.

- and the pH dependence of B speciation. The implications of these results for the distribution of B isotopes in seawater and sediment porewaters are briefly discussed. ?? 1987.},

abstract = {The authors review some of the new concepts of multicomponent electrolyte solutions and show how they can be applied to seawater. It is hoped that the application of these methods to the medium of seawater will provide a new approach to understanding the physical chemistry of seawater. Although the ion pairing models have proven to be very useful in discussing the interactions in seawater, it is not necessary to use this model to examine the physical chemistry of seawater. By using some of the new models for multicomponent electrolyte interaction, it is possible to estimate and treat the ionic interactions in seawater without invoking the concept of ion-pairing (even though ion pairing may occur). The authors attempt to answer such fundamental questions as: Can the physical chemical properties of seawater be treated as a simple electrolyte (e.g., sea salt). What are the properties of this sea salt. How do the properties of sea salt depend on the major components of seawater.},

abstract = {Demersal fishing alters seabed habitats and affects the structure and functioning of benthic invertebrate communities. At a critical level of disturbance, such communities may approach an equilibrium disturbed state in which a further increase in disturbance has little additional impact. Such arguments have been used to suggest that an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) should protect lightly fished areas and deflect fishing activity into areas that are already intensively fished. In this study, the effects of variation in fishing disturbance on the secondary production, species diversity, abundance, biomass, and community structure of benthic infauna were examined in a region of the German Bight (North Sea) that has been intensively trawled for decades. Variation in fishing disturbance across the study area was determined using automated position registration and vessel monitoring through satellite. Even in such a heavily fished area, linear regression analyses revealed that biomass, species richness, and production decreased significantly with increasing fishing intensity. Although redundancy analyses (RDA) showed that sediment characteristics were influential in determining the structure of the infauna community, partial RDA revealed that fishing continued to have an impact on community structure in terms of biomass. These results suggest that, in implementing an EAFM, managers will need to consider the possibility that, even in areas with high chronic fishing disturbance, further increases in fishing activity may still cause additional damage to benthic invertebrate communities.},

Here, we present laboratory evidence that calcification and net primary production in the coccolithophore species Emiliania huxleyi are significantly increased by high CO2 partial pressures. Field evidence from the deep ocean is consistent with these laboratory conclusions, indicating that over the past 220 years there has been a 40{\%} increase in average coccolith mass.

abstract = {The marine calcifying algae Emiliania huxleyi (coccolithophores) was grown in laboratory cultures under varying conditions with respect to the environmental parameters of temperature and carbonate ion concentration [CO3 2] concentration. The Ca isotope composition of E. huxleyi's coccoliths reveals new insights into fractionation processes during biomineralization. The temperature-dependent Ca isotope fractionation resembles previous calibrations of inorganic and biogenic calcite and aragonite. Unlike inorganically precipitated calcite, the [CO3 2] concentration of the medium has no significant effect on the Ca isotope composition of the coccoliths. These results indicate a decoupling of the chemical properties of the bulk medium and the calcifying vesicle. Cellular Ca pathways of E. huxleyi indicate that fractionation cannot occur at the crystal surface, as occurs during inorganic precipitation. The dominant processes leading to the observed Ca isotope fractionation pattern in E. huxleyi are most likely the dehydration of the Ca aquocomplex at the plasma membrane and the attachment of dissolved Ca to proteins of Ca channels. The independence of Ca isotope fractionation from [CO3 2] and the small temperature dependence of E. huxleyi are also important for defining the isotopic signature of the oceanic Ca sink. Since coccolithophores contribute to about half the global CaCO3 production, a relatively uniform isotopic composition of the oceanic Ca sink is further supported.},

Natural single crystals of calcite were coated with a thermally sputtered oxide thin film and then annealed in a CO2 gas at 1 atm total pressure and temperatures from 550 to 800 °C. Diffusion coefficient values were derived from the depth profiles obtained by ion microprobe analysis. The resultant activation energies for Mg tracer diffusion and Ca self-diffusion are, respectively: Ea(Mg) = 284 ± 74 kJ/mol and Ea(Ca) = 271 ± 80 kJ/mol. For the temperature ranges in these experiments, the diffusion of Mg is faster than Ca. The results are generally consistent in magnitude with divalent cation diffusion rates obtained in previous studies, and provide a means of interpreting the thermal histories of carbonate minerals, the mechanism of dolomitization, and other diffusion-controlled processes. The results indicate that cation diffusion in calcite is relatively slow and cations are the rate-limiting diffusing species for the deformation of calcite and carbonate rocks. Application of the calcite-dolomite geothermometer to metamorphic assemblages will be constrained by cation diffusion and cooling rates. The direct measurement of Mg tracer diffusion in calcite indicates that dolomitization is unlikely to be accomplished by Mg diffusion in the solid state but by a recrystallization process.},

abstract = {Cadmium mimics the distribution of the macronutrient phosphate in the oceans, and has uses as a palaeoproxy of past ocean circulation and nutrient utilization. Isotopic analyses of dissolved Cd in modern seawater show potential as a new tool for disentangling phytoplankton utilization of Cd from abiotic processes, such as ocean mixing. Extending this information into the past requires the Cd isotope signal to be captured and faithfully preserved in a suitable sedimentary archive. However, the role that environmental factors, such as temperature, may play in controlling Cd isotope fractionation into such archives has not been assessed. To this end, we have performed controlled inorganic CaCO3 precipitation experiments in artificial seawater solutions. We grew calcite under different precipitation rates, temperatures, salinities, and ambient [Mg2+], before measuring Cd isotopic compositions by double spike MC-ICPMS. We find that the isotopic ($\alpha$CaCO3-Cdaq) in seawater is always less than one (i.e. light isotopes of Cd are preferred in calcite). The fractionation factor has a value of 0.99955±0.00012 and shows no response to temperature, [Mg2+], or precipitation rate across the range studied. The constancy of this fractionation in seawater suggests that marine calcites may provide a record of the local seawater composition, without the need to correct for effects due to environmental variables. We also performed CaCO3 growth in freshwater and, in contrast to calcite precipitated from artificial seawater solutions, no isotopic offset was recorded between the growth solution and calcite ($\alpha$CaCO3-Cdaq=1.0000±0.0001). Cadmium isotope fractionation during calcite growth can be explained by a kinetic isotope effect during the largely unidirectional incorporation of Cd at the mineral surface. Further, the rate of Cd uptake and isotopic fractionation can be modulated by increased ion blocking of crystal surface sites at high salinity. The fractionation of Cd isotopes observed during precipitation of calcite has the same direction and similar magnitude to that implicated for Cd removal from the surface ocean by seawater measurements. However, flux calculations show that CaCO3 precipitation is unlikely to play a significant role in setting the Cd isotope composition in seawater, compared to Cd utilization in phytoplankton soft tissue. Marine carbonates therefore record seawater Cd isotope chemistry - with potential as a palaeoceanographic proxy - rather than drive oceanic Cd isotope compositions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Specific binding of the antigen recognized by these antibodies was similar to the hybridoma-derived antibody. Transformants having bold gamma- or kappa-chain cDNAs without leader sequences gave poor expression of the proteins. The increased abundance of both bold gamma-and kappa-chains in transformants expressing assembled gamma-kappa complexes was not reflected in increased mRNA levels. The results demonstrate that production of immunoglobulins and assembly of functional antibodies occurs very efficiently in tobacco.

abstract = {Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios were determined on a single species of planktonic foraminiferan, Globigerinoides ruber (white), collected from the Gulf of Eilat and cultured in seawater at five different salinities (32 to 44), five temperatures (18 to 30 °C) and four pH values (7.9 to 8.4). The Mg/Ca-temperature calibration of cultured G. ruber (with an exponential slope of 8 ± 3{\%}/°C) agrees well with previously published calibrations from core-tops and sediment traps. However, the dependence of Mg/Ca on salinity (with an exponential slope of 5 ± 3{\%}/psu) is also significant and should be included in the calibration equation. With this purpose, we calculated a calibration equation for G. ruber dependent on both temperature and salinity within the 95{\%} confidence limits:Mg / Ca (mmol/mol) = e x p [0.06 (± 0.02) * S (psu) + 0.08 (± 0.02) * T (° C) 2.8 (± 1.0)], R2 = 0.95 The influence of pH on Mg/Ca ratios is negligible at ambient seawater pH (8.1 to 8.3). However, we observe a dominating pH control on shell Mg/Ca when the pH of seawater is lower than 8.0. Sr/Ca in G. ruber shows a significant positive correlation with average growth rate. Presumably, part of the variability in shell Sr/Ca in the geological record is linked to changes in growth rates of foraminifera as a response to changing environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Equilibrium boron isotopic fractionations between trigonal B(OH)3 and tetragonal B(OH)4- aqueous species have been calculated at high P-T conditions using measured vibrational spectra (Raman and IR) and force-field modeling to compute reduced partition function ratios for B-isotopic exchange following Urey's theory. The calculated isotopic fractionation factor at 300 K, $\alpha$3/4 = 1.0176(2), is slightly lower than the formerly calculated value of $\alpha$3/4 = 1.0193 (Kakihana and Kotaka, 1977), due to differences in the determined vibrational frequencies. The effect of pressure on $\alpha$3/4 up to 10 GPa and 723 K is shown to be negligible relative to temperature or speciation (pH) effects. Implications for the interpretation of boron fractionation in experimental and natural systems are discussed. We also show that the relationship between seawater-mineral B isotope fractionation and pH can be expressed using two variables, $\alpha$3/4 on one hand, and the pKa of the boric acid-borate equilibrium on the other hand. This latter value is given by the equilibrium of boron species in water for the carbonate-water exchange, but could be governed by mineral surface properties in the case of clays. This may allow defining intrinsic paleo-pHmeters from B isotope fractionation between carbonate and authigenic minerals. Finally, it is shown that fractionation of boron isotopes can be rationalized in terms of the changes in 1) coordination of B from trigonal to tetrahedral in both fluids and minerals; and 2) the ligand nature around B from OH- in the fluid and some hydrous minerals to non-hydrogenated O in many minerals. Relationships are established that allow predicting the isotopic fractionation factor of B between minerals and fluid. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Stony corals build hard skeletons of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) by combining calcium with carbonate ions derived, ultimately, from seawater. Te concentration of carbonate ions relative to other carbonate species in seawater is rather low, so corals expend energy to raise the pH of seawater sequestered in an isolated, extracellular compartment where crystal growth occurs. Tis action converts plentiful bicarbonate ions to the carbonate ions required for calcification, allowing corals to produce CaCO3 about 100 times faster than it could otherwise form. It is this rapid and efficient production of CaCO3 crystals that enables corals to build coral reefs. Ocean acidification reduces the pH and thus the abundance of carbonate ions in seawater. Corals living in acidified seawater continue to produce CaCO3 and expend as much energy as their counterparts in normal seawater to raise the pH of the calci- fying fluid. However, in acidified seawater, corals are unable to elevate the concentra- tion of carbonate ions to the level required for normal skeletal growth. In several experiments, we found that boosting the energetic status of corals by enhanced heterotrophic feeding or moderate increases in inorganic nutrients helped to offset the negative impact of ocean acidification. However, this built-in defense is unlikely to benefit corals as levels of CO2 in the atmosphere continue to rise. Most climate models predict that the availability of inorganic nutrients and plankton in the surface waters where corals live will decrease as a consequence of global warming. Tus, corals and coral reefs may be significantly more vulnerable to ocean acidification than previously thought.},

abstract = {The well-known phenomenon of the blocking of crystal growth at low supersaturations by a low density of immobile impurities adsorbed on the crystal surface has been investigated by the Monte Carlo technique. The computer simulations were carried out for [100] steps on the (OO1) face of a solid-on-solid Kossel crystal covered by a square array of immobile impurities. Above and slightly below the roughening temperature, blocking of crystal growth was found to be due to the creation of an extra internal surface free energy as a result of the incorporation of impurities. Here the width of the dead supersaturation zone is inversely proportional to the squared distance between the impurities. At lower temperatures growth is blocked by pinning of the growth steps at the impurity centres as proposed in an early paper by Cabrera and Vermilyea (1958), in which the width of the "dead zone" is inversely proportional to the impurity separation. Further issues addressed to in this paper are a kinetic impurity blocking for rough faces and the blocking of step propagation by randomly deposited impurities as well as by the smallest possible impurities of one growth unit in size.

abstract = {A fundamental concept in the study of biomineralization concerns the molecular recognition of inorganic materials at organized organic macromolecular substrates1. Here we investigate this concept through the use of stearic acid monolayers in the controlled crystallization of CaCO3 from supersaturated solutions. Whereas crystallization in the absence of a monolayer results in rhombohedral calcite crystals, the presence of an organized monolayer gives rise to oriented vaterite formation. The vaterite nuclei are aligned with their (0001) face parallel to the plane of the organic substrate and develop initially in the form of disk-shaped single crystals. The degree of compression of the monolayer dictates the homogeneity of vaterite nucleation. In particular, partially compressed films are optimal for controlled crystallization, suggesting that the mobility of organic surfaces may be of general importance. Our results can be explained by electrostatic and stereochemical interactions at the inorganic–organic interface and these observations support current theories of biomineralization, as well as being of potential significance in the crystal engineering of microscopic inorganic assemblies2.},

It is proposed that these coupled changes are the result of secular variation in seawater chemistry controlled primarily by fluctuations in the mid-ocean ridge hydrother- mal brine flux, which in turn have been driven by fluctuations in the rate of ocean crust production. Quantitative predictions based on this hypothesis yield secular variation in limestone and potash evaporite mineralogies that closely match the observed variation over the past 600 m.y., providing strong support for the thesis that seawater chemistry, rather than remaining constant, has oscillated significantly over geologic time.

abstract = {The use of MC-ICP-MS for B isotopic measurements offers some advantages compared with other techniques such as the absence of interferences with atomic masses 10 and 11 and an enhanced speed of data acquisition. We have developed a fast and simple protocol for the separation by ion-exchange resins and concentration of B from natural waters, carbonates, phosphates, and silicates. Normalization of sample isotopic ratios to the NIST reference NBS 951 leads to an external reproducibility of ± 0.3$\delta$ unit at 95{\%} confidence level. The ionization yield is about 2 ions per 106 atoms of B in the analyzed solution. At least 2 $\mu$g of boron is required to obtain the above good-quality external reproducibility. Replicated analyses of Mediterranean seawater provided a $\delta$11 B of 40.26 ± 0.29 (n=11). Aragonite-secreting fauna (corals and bivalves) living in tropical seawater have $\delta$11B close to 25‰ that are much higher than calcite-secreting invertebrates such as brachiopods from tropical to high latitudes with $\delta$11B ranging from 16.8‰ to 19.6‰. The first application to this method was to reevaluate the boron isotopic fractionation between calcite and water as a function of pH. We analyzed the calcitic shell of present-day brachiopods living in marine waters (surface down to 450 m) with pH varying from 7.6 to 8.4. By combining our data with those obtained by Sanyal et al. [Paleoceanography 11 (1996) 513] on cultured foraminifera, we derived an isotopic fractionation curve ($\alpha$calcite-seawater = 0.023x[B(OH)4

This necessitated a new assessment of kidney pathological findings, and the results remained controversial. An Appeal Court action in Germany (M{\"{u}}nster) allowed public access in June 2005 to all the crude data from this 90-day rat-feeding study. We independently re-analyzed these data. Appropriate statistics were added, such as a multivariate analysis of the growth curves, and for biochemical parameters comparisons between GMO-treated rats and the controls fed with an equivalent normal diet, and separately with six reference diets with different compositions. We observed that after the consumption of MON863, rats showed slight but dose-related significant variations in growth for both sexes, resulting in 3.3{\%} decrease in weight for males and 3.7{\%} increase for females. Chemistry measurements reveal signs of hepatorenal toxicity, marked also by differential sensitivities in males and females. Triglycerides increased by 24–40{\%} in females (either at week 14, dose 11{\%} or at week 5, dose 33{\%}, respectively); urine phosphorus and sodium excretions diminished in males by 31–35{\%} (week 14, dose 33{\%}) for the most important results significantly linked to the treatment in comparison to seven diets tested.

From the results it is concluded that they can be categorized into two types, each with a different location, structure and composition which reflect distinct differences in function. Thus it is apparent that one type is concerned with processes of ion regulation and pH balance of the body fluids and the other is concerned primarily with the detoxification of certain metals. Furthermore, from the evidence presented in the review, it is proposed that the concept presented can be applied to the systems of intracellular mineralization which operate in the tissues of other molluses and animals from other phyla. ?? 1981.},

Our experiments show that the calcite growth rate is reduced by the presence of Mg2+. The higher the Mg/Ca ratio in the solution, the lower the growth rate in a CaCO3 supersaturated solution. The inhibition of calcite growth by the presence of Mg2+ is caused by Mg2+ being incorporated into the original calcite seed surfaces and developing new crystal surfaces. The Mg2+ distribution on the calcite surfaces is not uniform as there is likely to be different Mg2+ densities on the newly developed surfaces than on the original surfaces of the calcite seeds. This causes the calcite crystal morphology to change. The significance of creating error in using the initial rate data rather than the equilibrium rate data for the prediction of the calcite precipitation kinetics is discussed.},

The extent to which this intergenomic colinearity is confounded at the micro level by gene duplication and micro-rearrangements is still an open question. Nevertheless, it is clear that the elucidation of the organization of the economically important grasses with larger genomes, such as maize (2n = 10, 4,500 Mb DNA), will, to a greater or lesser extent, be predicted from sequence analysis of smaller genomes such as rice, with only 400 Mb, which in turn may be greatly aided by knowledge of the entire sequence of Arabidopsis, which may be available as soon as the turn of the century.

Across this pH range, the abundances of carbonate, bicarbonate, and borate ions also change (+530, -500, and +170??molkg-1, respectively). Thus specific carbonate system control(s) on B/Ca remain unclear, complicating interpretation of paleorecords. B/Ca in cultured O. universa also increases with salinity (55-72??molmol-1 from 29.9-35.4???) and seawater boron concentration (62-899??molmol-1 from 4-40ppm B), suggesting that these parameters may need to be taken into account for paleorecords spanning large salinity changes ({\~{}} 2???) and for samples grown in seawater whose boron concentration ([B]SW) differs from modern by more than 0.25ppm. While our results are consistent with the predominant incorporation of the charged borate species BOH4-into foraminiferal calcite, the behavior of the partition coefficient KD (defined as [B/Ca]calcite/BOH4-/HCO3-seawater) cannot be explained by borate incorporation alone, and suggests the involvement of other pH-sensitive ions such as CO3
2- For a given increase in seawater B(OH)4-, the corresponding increase in B/Ca is stronger when B(OH)4- is raised by increasing [B]SW than when it is raised by increasing pH. These results suggest that B incorporation controls should be reconsidered. Additional insight is gained from laser-ablation ICP-MS profiles, which reveal variable B/Ca distributions within individual shells. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Ocean pH is particularly sensitive to atmospheric carbon dioxide content(1-3). Records of ocean pH can therefore be used to estimate past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. The isotopic composition of boron (delta B-11) contained in the carbonate shells of marine organisms varies according to pH, from which ocean pH can be reconstructed(4-11). This requires independent estimates of the delta B-11 of dissolved boron in sea water through time. The marine delta B-11 budget, however, is still largely unconstrained. Here we show that, by incorporating the global flux of riverine boron (as estimated from delta B-11 measurements in 22 of the world's main rivers), the marine boron isotope budget can be balanced. We also derive ocean delta B-11 budgets for the past 120 Myr. Estimated isotope compositions of boron in sea water show a remarkable consistency with records of delta B-11 in foraminiferal carbonates(9-11), suggesting that foraminifera delta B-11 records may in part reflect changes in the marine boron isotope budget rather than changes in ocean pH over the Cenozoic era.},

Interferometer control implemented in both microscopes allows the precise measurement of the transverse position of the zone plate relative to the sample. Long-term positional stability and compensation for transverse displacement during translations of the zone plate have been achieved. The interferometer also provides low-distortion orthogonal x, y imaging. Two different control systems have been developed: a digital control system using standard VXI components at beamline 7.0, and a custom feedback system based on PC AT boards at beamline 5.3.2. Both microscopes are diffraction limited with the resolution set by the quality of the zone plates. Periodic features with 30 nm half period can be resolved with a zone plate that has a 40 nm outermost zone width. One microscope is operating at an undulator beamline (7.0), while the other is operating at a novel dedicated bending-magnet beamline (5.3.2), which is designed specifically to illuminate the microscope. The undulator beamline provides count rates of the order of tens of MHz at high-energy resolution with photon energies of up to about 1000 eV. Although the brightness of a bending-magnet source is about four orders of magnitude smaller than that of an undulator source, photon statistics limited operation with intensities in excess of 3 MHz has been achieved at high energy resolution and high spatial resolution. The design and performance of these microscopes are described.},

abstract = {Transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase II at the 3' end of genes encoding poly(A)+ mRNAs is thought to require two distinct cis-active elements: a functional poly(A) signal and a downstream transcriptional pause site. An important requirement for efficient termination is to prevent transcriptional interference of downstream-located promoters. We have therefore investigated whether these two elements, individually or in combination, can prevent transcriptional interference of RNA polymerase II-activated promoters. For this purpose, we constructed an expression plasmid containing two tandem retroviral long terminal repeats (LTRs) derived from HIV-1. When transfected into HeLa cells, this construct resulted in transcriptional interference of the LTR promoters. Using this assay, we were able to show that a single poly(A) signal was able to protect an otherwise occluded promoter. This effect depended on the RNA-processing strength of the poly(A) signal. Furthermore, transcriptional pause sites provided adequate protection against promoter occlusion even when tested alone. Finally, a combined element consisting of a poly(A) signal followed by a pause site was more efficient in promoter protection than either element on its own. These results indicate that an interference-blocking element can take various forms: a poly(A) signal, a transcriptional pause site or a combination of both.},

Here we show that HCO3- uptake by the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii is modulated by the partial pressure of CO2 and by the concentration of inorganic Zn (for which Cd and Co may substitute in carbonic anhydrase). This result leads naturally to a 'zinc hypothesis' which, like the standing 'iron hypothesis'(10), posits that Zn (Fe) may limit oceanic production and influence the global carbon cycle. Because of the large C-13 enrichment of HCO3- over CO2, our results may be important for the interpretation of delta(13)C measurements in seawater and sediments.},

abstract = {Coccolithophores are important ecological and geochemical components of the global oceans. A global three-dimensional model was used to simulate their distributions in a multi-phytoplankton context. The realism of the simulation was supported by comparisons of model surface nutrients and total chlorophyll with in situ and satellite observations. Nitrate, silica, and dissolved iron surface distributions were positively correlated with in situ data across major oceanographic basins. Global annual departures were +18.9{\%} for nitrate (model high), +5.4{\%} for silica, and +45.0{\%} for iron. Total surface chlorophyll was also positively correlated with satellite and in situ data sets across major basins. Global annual departures were -8.0{\%} with Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) (model low), +1.1{\%} with Aqua, and -17.1{\%} with in situ data. Global annual primary production estimates were within 1{\%} and 9{\%} of estimates derived from SeaWiFS and Aqua, respectively, using a common primary production algorithm. Coccolithophore annual mean relative abundances were 2.6{\%} lower than observations, but were positively correlated across basins. Two of the other three phytoplankton groups, diatoms and cyanobacteria, were also positively correlated with observations. Distributions of coccolithophores were dependent upon interactions and competition with the other phytoplankton groups. In this model, coccolithophores had a competitive advantage over diatoms and chlorophytes by virtue of a greater ability to utilize nutrients and light at low values. However, their higher sinking rates placed them at a disadvantage when nutrients and light were plentiful. In very low nutrient conditions, such as the mid-ocean gyres, coccolithophores were unable to compete with the efficient nutrient utilization capability and low sinking rate of cyanobacteria. Comparisons of simulated coccolithophore distributions with satellite-derived estimates of calcite concentration and coccolithophore blooms showed some agreement, but also areas of departure. Vast blooms observed in the North Atlantic were well-represented by the model. However, model coccolithophores were nearly absent in the North Pacific, while calcite estimates suggested widespread abundance in summer. In situ observations supported the satellite calcite, suggesting a deficiency in the model. New satellite estimates of phytoplankton groups indicated good agreement of diatoms in one case, and poor agreement in general in another. Comparisons of phytoplankton group primary production with other models showed wide disparity. The divergence among models and satellite estimates is common for such an emerging field of research. The quantitative comparisons with in situ observations are encouraging, but disparities with model and satellite estimates suggested that further research is needed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Neogloboquadrina dutertrei (P-D) intergrades and Globoconella inflata from core-top, dredge and plankton tow material from the Southwest Pacific Ocean. The presence of outer crusts on each foraminifera test was determined using a scanning electron microscope, after trace element analysis using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). Our laser ablation profiles allow an arbitrary distinction between crust and inner calcite Mg/Ca values, with the former exhibiting consistently lower Mg/Ca by up to 56{\%} depending on both the species and core-top location analyzed. The lower crust Mg/Ca values suggest that 1) crust formation may be initiated at a specific (low) temperature or, 2) crust-calcite no longer follows the Mg to Ca thermodynamic relationship typically associated with foraminiferal primary calcite. For Sr/Ca ratios, we did not observe any difference between crust in and inner calcite. The thickness of the crust between measured individual chambers varied, such that whole test Mg/Ca were affected by variable crustal thickness across all chambers. This study shows that increasing ratios of crust to non crust-bearing tests in N. incompta, P-D intergrades and G. inflata have the potential to lower the bulk composition of Mg/Ca, thus resulting in biased cooler temperature reconstructions. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Stable amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is a unique material produced naturally exclusively as a biomineral. It was demonstrated that proteins extracted from biogenic stable ACC induce and stabilize synthetic ACC in vitro. Polyphosphate molecules were similarly shown to induce amorphous calcium carbonate formation in vitro. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that biogenic ACC induction and stabilization is mediated by the phosphorylated residues of phosphoproteins. We show that extracellular organic matrix extracted from gastroliths of the red claw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus induce stable ACC formation in vitro. The proteinaceous fraction of this organic matrix is highly phosphorylated and is incorporated into the ACC mineral phase during precipitation. We have identified the major phosphoproteins of the organic matrix and showed that they have high calcium binding capacity. Based on the above, in vitro precipitation experiments with single phosphoamino acids were performed, indicating that phosphoserine or phosphothreonine alone can induce the formation of highly stable ACC. The results indicate that phosphoproteins may play a major role in the control of ACC formation and stabilization and that their phosphoamino acid moieties are key components in this process. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The symbiosis between reef-building corals and their algal endosymbionts (zooxanthellae of the genus Symbiodinium) is highly sensitive to temperature stress, which makes coral reefs vulnerable to climate change. Thermal tolerance in corals is known to be substantially linked to the type of zooxanthellae they harbour and, when multiple types are present, the relative abundance of types can be experimentally manipulated to increase the thermal limits of individual corals. Although the potential exists for this to translate into substantial thermal acclimatization of coral communities, to date there is no evidence to show that this takes place under natural conditions. In this study, we show field evidence of a dramatic change in the symbiont community of Acropora millepora, a common and widespread Indo-Pacific hard coral species, after a natural bleaching event in early 2006 in the Keppel Islands (Great Barrier Reef). Before bleaching, 93.5{\%} (n=460) of the randomly sampled and tagged colonies predominantly harboured the thermally sensitive Symbiodinium type C2, while the remainder harboured a tolerant Symbiodinium type belonging to clade D or mixtures of C2 and D. After bleaching, 71{\%} of the surviving tagged colonies that were initially C2 predominant changed to D or C1 predominance. Colonies that were originally C2 predominant suffered high mortality (37{\%}) compared with D-predominant colonies (8{\%}). We estimate that just over 18{\%} of the original A. millepora population survived unchanged leaving 29{\%} of the population C2 and 71{\%} D or C1 predominant six months after the bleaching event. This change in the symbiont community structure, while it persists, is likely to have substantially increased the thermal tolerance of this coral population. Understanding the processes that underpin the temporal changes in symbiont communities is key to assessing the acclimatization potential of reef corals.},

The 14C technique for measuring calcification was evaluated with calcifying and noncalcifying coccolithophore strains. Shipboard bloom observations showed physiological evidence of stratification between surface and deep populations within the surface mixed layer. Photosynthesis and calcification rates were enhanced within hours of addition of KNO3 or nitrate-rich deep water (to the same final concentration). Such rates were strongly temperature dependent in laboratory cultures, decreasing over a factor of two from 15 to 20°C. Calcification was considerably less light-dependent than photosynthesis and consistently had a measurable dark rate. In culture, maximum calcification rates and degree of cell plating were limited to logarithmic growth phase. This was followed by rapid increase in the coccolith shedding rate 1 day prior to the onset of stationary phase which continued several days after cell division stopped. The regional significance of these features to total organic and inorganic carbon production as well as calcite burial is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Amino acid analysis and N-terminal sequencing revealed that this mixture of intracrystalline macromolecules consists predominantly of glycine-rich polypeptides. In vitro calcium carbonate precipitation experiments indicate that the SOM accelerates the conversion of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) into its final crystalline product. From this observation and from the discovery of ACC in other closely related taxa, it is suggested that substitution of magnesium into the calcite lattice through a transient precursor phase may be a universal phenomenon prevalent across the phylum echinodermata.},

They can cope with their inherent physiological flexibility, evolve or adapt to new conditions, or migrate away to areas consistent with survival. The main factors dictating survival are the rates of change and capacities of species to cope. Articulated brachiopods are known as a group that employ low energy solutions and exhibit slow rates in life histories characters, especially in growth and metabolic rates. This way of life carries with it a range of consequences, including poor abilities to raise metabolic rates to perform work. This brings with it poor abilities to cope with elevated temperature. Slow growth, deferred maturity and low feeding rates make them less likely to produce novel adaptations compared with other marine invertebrate taxa. Being largely restricted to hard substrata and low energy supply environments also makes it harder for them to migrate to new sites compared to other groups, because of the large geographic distances between colonisable areas. The only clear area they may have that gives them advantages is in the flexibility of their larval release strategies, where settlement can be from very short, millimetre-scale distances to hundreds of kilometres. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2008 Royal Society of Edinburgh.},

abstract = {Calcium isotope fractionation was measured on skeletal aragonite and calcite from different marine biota and on inorganic calcite. Precipitation temperatures ranged from 0 to 28°C. Calcium isotope fractionation shows a temperature dependence in accordance with previous observations: 1000 {\textperiodcentered} ln($\alpha$cc) = -1.4 + 0.021 {\textperiodcentered} T (°C) for calcite and 1000 {\textperiodcentered} ln($\alpha$ar) = -1.9 + 0.017 {\textperiodcentered} T (°C) for aragonite. Within uncertainty the temperature slopes are identical for the two polymorphs. However, at all temperatures calcium isotopes are more fractionated in aragonite than in calcite. The offset in $\delta$44/40Ca is about 0.6‰. The underlying mechanism for this offset may be related to the different coordination numbers and bond strengths of the calcium ions in calcite and aragonite crystals, or to different Ca reaction behavior at the solid-liquid interface. Recently, the observed temperature dependence of the Ca isotope fractionation was explained quantitatively by the temperature control on precipitation rates of calcium carbonates in an experimental setting (Lemarchand et al., 2004). We show that this mechanism can in principle also be applied to CaCO3 precipitation in natural environments in normal marine settings. Following this model, Ca isotope fractionation in marine Ca carbonates is primarily controlled by precipitation rates. On the other hand the larger Ca isotope fractionation of aragonite compared to calcite can not be explained by different precipitation rates. The rate control model of Ca isotope fractionation predicts a strong dependence of the Ca isotopic composition of carbonates on ambient CO32- concentration. While this model is in general accordance with our observations in marine carbonates, cultured specimens of the planktic foraminifer Orbulina universa show no dependence of Ca-isotope fractionation on the ambient CO32- concentration. The latter observation implies that the carbonate chemistry in the calcifying vesicles of the foraminifer is independent from the ambient carbonate ion concentration of the surrounding water.

abstract = {This study summarizes the relationships between various biological and optical properties of a mesoscale coccolithophore bloom observed in the North Atlantic during June 1991. Backscattering and coccolith concentration were positively correlated. Backscattering and concentration of suspended calcite were even better correlated because atomic absorption analyses of calcite calcium were equally accurate whether calcite was attached or detached from cells, whereas it was difficult to enumerate the numbers of coccoliths attached to cells by means of microscopy. As the bloom aged, the ratio of detached coccoliths to plated cells increased. Dilution experiments provided the most precise relationships between coccolith backscattering and coccolith abundance. The calcite-specific scattering coefficient was estimated from measurements of beam attenuation, absorption, and calcite concentration. The contribution of coccolith backscattering to total scattering was modeled as a function of coccolith concentration and chlorophyll concentration. Even outside the coccolithophore bloom, coccoliths were responsible for 5-30{\%} of the total backscattering. Anomalous diffraction theory was used to show that calcite-specific scattering is the highest for I-3-pm spheres, which correspond to the diameters of Emiliania huxleyi coccoliths (this prediction was close to the observed values). The calcite-specific scattering coefficients of larger calcite particles (e.g. plated coccolithophore cells, foraminifera, pteropods) would be expected to be considerably lower. These data were used to test an approach for predicting coccolith concentration from water-leaving radiance in the blue and green wavelengths.},

abstract = {Partial or selective dissolution of planktonic foraminiferal tests on the seafloor has been shown to alter original test Mg/Ca compositions and thus may limit the accuracy of Mg/Ca-based thermometry for reconstructions of past sea surface temperatures. We have employed laser ablation ICPMS to determine the extent of dissolution-caused changes in Mg/Ca distribution across individual chamber walls of the planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides sacculifer and Orbulina universa. G. sacculifer samples collected from a core-top depth transect in the NE Indian Ocean and laboratory dissolution experiments show little if any evidence of preferential removal of Mg-rich calcite layers by progressive dissolution of the tests. We attribute the absence of selective dissolution to the banded distribution of Mg across the chamber walls of these foraminiferal species and to the minimal presence of calcite crusts with relatively low-Mg composition on the outer surfaces of tests. Mg/Ca microanalyses of G. sacculifer from core-top samples further indicate that for samples collected above the calcite lysocline the effect of postdepositional dissolution on Mg/Ca sample mean values is minimal and within the uncertainty of Mg/Ca thermometry (i.e. ±0.4mmol/mol; ±0.8°C at {\~{}}28°C). Comparison with previously published results for G. sacculifer supports these observations. Simple modelling of G. sacculifer test dissolution indicates that selective removal of calcite with high-Mg/Ca values from within the final chamber of G. sacculifer test appears insufficient to cause the {\~{}}10{\%} decrease in Mg/Ca values observed above calcite lysocline. These changes in test composition might be related to development/removal as a function of $\Delta$[CO32-] of a thin diagenetic surface coating which has a relatively high-Mg/Ca composition (i.e. 20-25mmol/mol). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Sandeels are known to be negatively affected by climate change in a number of ways. This study investigated whether these changes are affecting the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), a species which consumes sandeels. Porpoise diet was examined in spring (March-May), a critical time of year for survival when sandeels are important prey, from 1993 to 2001 to provide baseline information on the proportion of sandeels consumed. When data from spring 2002 and 2003 were compared to these baseline data, the diet was found to be substantially different, with a significant and substantially smaller proportion of sandeels being consumed in March and May. There were also differences in the number of porpoises starving between the two time periods (33{\%} in spring 2002 and 2003 died of starvation, but only 5{\%} in the baseline period). This suggests that a lower proportion of sandeels in the diet of porpoises in spring increases the likelihood of starvation. Therefore, we suggest that the negative effects of climate change on sandeel availability may have serious negative effects on harbour porpoise populations in the North Sea by increasing the likelihood of starvation in spring.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Writing plays a central role in the communication of scientific ideas and is therefore a key aspect in researcher education, ultimately determining the success and long-term sustainability of their careers. Despite the growing popularity of e-learning, we are not aware of any existing study comparing on-line vs. traditional classroom-based methods for teaching scientific writing.METHODS:Forty eight participants from a medical, nursing and physiotherapy background from US and Brazil were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 24 per group): An on-line writing workshop group (on-line group), in which participants used virtual communication, google docs and standard writing templates, and a standard writing guidance training (standard group) where participants received standard instruction without the aid of virtual communication and writing templates. Two outcomes, manuscript quality was assessed using the scores obtained in Six subgroup analysis scale as the primary outcome measure, and satisfaction scores with Likert scale were evaluated. To control for observer variability, inter-observer reliability was assessed using Fleiss{\&}apos;s kappa. A post-hoc analysis comparing rates of communication between mentors and participants was performed. Nonparametric tests were used to assess intervention efficacy.RESULTS:Excellent inter-observer reliability among three reviewers was found, with an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) agreement = 0.931882 and ICC consistency = 0.932485. On-line group had better overall manuscript quality (p = 0.0017, SSQSavg score 75.3 +/- 14.21, ranging from 37 to 94) compared to the standard group (47.27 +/- 14.64, ranging from 20 to 72). Participant satisfaction was higher in the on-line group (4.3 +/- 0.73) compared to the standard group (3.09 +/- 1.11) (p = 0.001). The standard group also had fewer communication events compared to the on-line group (0.91 +/- 0.81 vs. 2.05 +/- 1.23; p = 0.0219).CONCLUSION:Our protocol for on-line scientific writing instruction is better than standard face-to-face instruction in terms of writing quality and student satisfaction. Future studies should evaluate the protocol efficacy in larger longitudinal cohorts involving participants from different languages.},

abstract = {Historically, Archaias angulatus has been a major contributor to foraminiferal assemblages and sediments in coral-reef environments throughout the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic. A variety of anomalous features were observed in the tests of A. angulatus individuals collected live from the Florida reef tract in 2004 and 2005. Six types of anomalies were documented using scanning electron microscopy: microborings, microbial biofilm, pitted surfaces, dissolution, calcification abnormalities and growth abnormalities. Calcification abnormalities included mineralogical projections, lacy crusts and repair marks. These abnormalities were found among both juvenile and adult A. angulatus, and similar features were also found among Cyclorbiculina compressa and Laevipeneroplis proteus specimens collected live in the same samples. The implications of these observations are at least twofold. First, in studies of fossil assemblages, damage to tests and changes in test-surface textures should not be assumed to have occurred postmortem and may provide evidence of environmental stressors acting upon living populations. In addition, we speculate that test dissolution in larger miliolid foraminifers when alive can indicate declining carbonate saturation in seawater, which can result locally from salinity changes or increasing benthic respiration rates, as well as globally from rising concentration of atmospheric CO2.},

abstract = {Foraging adaptations include behavioral and physiological responses, but most optimal foraging models deal exclusively with behavioral decision variables, taking other dimensions as constraints. To overcome this limitation, we measured behavioral and physiological responses of European starlings Sturnus vulgaris to changes in food availability in a laboratory environment. The birds lived in a closed economy with a choice of two foraging modes (flying and walking) and were observed under two treatments (hard and easy) that differed in the work required to obtain food. Comparing the hard with the easy treatment, we found the following differences. In the hard treatment, daily amount of work was higher, but daily intake was lower. Even though work was greater, total daily expenditure was smaller, partly because overnight metabolism was lower. Body mass was lower, but daily oscillation in body mass did not differ. Feces' caloric density was lower, indicating greater food utilization. Energy expenditure rate expressed as multiples of basal metabolic rate (BMR) increased during the working period from 3.5 x BMR (easy) to 5.2 x BMR (hard), but over the 24-h period, it was close to 2.4 x BMR in both treatments. We also found that rate of expenditure during flight was very high in both treatments (52.3 W in easy and 45.5 W in hard), as expected for short (as opposed to cruising) flights. The relative preferences between walking and flying were incompatible with maximizing the ratio of energy gains per unit of expenditure (efficiency) but compatible with maximizing net gain per unit of time during the foraging cycle (net rate). Neither currency explained the results when nonforaging time was included. Time was not a direct constraint: the birds rested more than 90{\%} of the time in both treatments. Understanding this complex picture requires reasoning with ecological, physiological, and cognitive arguments. We defend the role of optimality as an appropriate tool to guide this integrative perspective.},

Determining the biogenicity of such ancient fossils is the subject of ongoing debate. However, many obstacles to interpretation of the fossils are overcome in the SPC because of the broad extent, excellent preservation and morphological variety of its stromatolitic outcrops--which provide comprehensive palaeontological information on a scale exceeding other rocks of such age. Here we present a multi-kilometre-scale palaeontological and palaeoenvironmental study of the SPC, in which we identify seven stromatolite morphotypes--many previously undiscovered--in different parts of a peritidal carbonate platform. We undertake the first morphotype-specific analysis of the structures within their palaeoenvironment and refute contemporary abiogenic hypotheses for their formation. Finally, we argue that the diversity, complexity and environmental associations of the stromatolites describe patterns that--in similar settings throughout Earth's history--reflect the presence of organisms.},

abstract = {The carbon dioxide (CO2) content of the atmosphere has varied cyclically between approximately 180 and approximately 280 parts per million by volume over the past 800,000 years, closely coupled with temperature and sea level. For earlier periods in Earth's history, the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) is much less certain, and the relation between pCO2 and climate remains poorly constrained. We use boron/calcium ratios in foraminifera to estimate pCO2 during major climate transitions of the past 20 million years. During the Middle Miocene, when temperatures were approximately 3 degrees to 6 degrees C warmer and sea level was 25 to 40 meters higher than at present, pCO2 appears to have been similar to modern levels. Decreases in pCO(2) were apparently synchronous with major episodes of glacial expansion during the Middle Miocene (approximately 14 to 10 million years ago) and Late Pliocene (approximately 3.3 to 2.4 million years ago).},

abstract = {We assembled a dataset of C-14-based productivity measurements to understand the critical variables required for accurate assessment of daily depth-integrated phytoplankton carbon fixation (PPeu) from measurements of sea surface pigment concentrations (C-sat). From this dataset, we developed a light-dependent, depth-resolved model for carbon fixation (VGPM) that partitions environmental factors affecting primary production into those that influence the relative vertical distribution of primary production (P-z) and those that control the optimal assimilation efficiency of the productivity profile (P-opt(B)). The VGPM accounted for 79{\%} of the observed variability in P-z and 86{\%} of the variability in PPeu by using measured values of P-opt(B). Our results indicate that the accuracy of productivity algorithms in estimating PPeu is dependent primarily upon the ability to accurately represent variability in P-opt(B). We developed a temperature-dependent P-opt(B), model that was used in conjunction with monthly climatological images of C-sat, sea surface temperature, and cloud-corrected estimates of surface irradiance to calculate a global annual phytoplankton carbon fixation (PPannu) rate of 43.5 Pg C yr(-1). The geographical distribution of PPannu was distinctly different than results from previous models. Our results illustrate the importance of focusing P-opt(B) model development on temporal and spatial, rather than the vertical, variability.},

abstract = {Soft computing is an emerging field that consists of complementary elements of fuzzy logic, neural computing and evolutionary computation. Soft computing techniques have found wide applications. One of the most important applications is image segmentation. The process of partitioning a digital image into multiple regions or sets of pixels is called image segmentation. Segmentation is an essential step in image processing since it conditions the quality of the resulting interpretation. Lots of approaches have been proposed and a dense literature is available In order to extract as much information as possible from an environment, multicomponent images can be used. In the last decade, multicomponent images segmentation has received a great deal of attention for soft computing applications because it significantly improves the discrimination and the recognition capabilities compared with gray-level image segmentation methods. In this paper, the main aim is to understand the soft computing approach to image segmentation.},

abstract = {The provision of a refuge from fish predation for large-bodied Cladocera among stands of submerged macrophytes is thought to be an important stabilising mechanism against nutrient-induced phytoplankton increases in clear water shallow lakes. The occurrence of any refuge effect in relation to the seasonal impact of both macrophyte development and recruitment of zooplanktivorous fish was monitored over the summer months (May to September) in three lakes (Cromes Broad, Hoveton Little Broad/Pound End, and Upton Broad) of variable trophic status, fish community structure and nature and extent of macrophyte cover, in the Norfolk Broads in Eastern England. At all sites, Daphnia spp. exhibited a early summer peak of abundance but had declined rapidly by July probably as a result of predation from underyearling fish. In extensive macrophyte stands (Cromes Broad) Daphnia spp. persisted after its elimination in open water, indicating some refuge effect. At sites with macrophyte cover and/or low fish predation pressure, Daphnia spp. was replaced by Ceriodaphnia spp., both with and without Simocephalus sp., thus maintaining large populations of grazing Cladocera, apparently capable of exerting a high grazing pressure on phytoplankton. This occurred, even under high predation pressure from a relatively high density of zooplanktivorous 0+ fish (Cromes Broad), consistent with the refuge hypothesis. In addition, at this site, significant positive associations of cladoceran abundance with increasing macrophyte cover were apparent throughout the summer. From information on the distribution of fish it is suggested that dense macrophytes offer the most suitable refuge through provision of predator-free space.},

All strains grew on ammonium, nitrate, and urea, although growth of CCMP379 on urea was low. Responses to other dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) sources varied. CCMP379 did not grow on any DON source other than urea. All other strains grew on one of the two tested amino acids: CCMP370 and CCMP373 on glutamine, and CCMP374 on alanine. All three of these strains also grew on hypoxanthine; in addition, two grew well on acetamide and one on ethanolamine. E. huxleyi strains also differed in their susceptibility to predation by the ciliate Strobilidium sp. CCMP374 was ingested at substantially higher rates than CCMP373 regardless of E. huxleyi growth condition. Ciliate feeding rates also depended on E. huxleyi growth condition. For CCMP374, feeding rates were 2?? higher on growing E. huxleyi cells than on non-growing cells (average 27.5 versus 15.6 cells ciliate

abstract = {1 A method has been developed for rapid and precise simultaneous determination of nine element/Ca ratios in foraminiferal tests directly from intensity ratios using external, matrix-matched standards on a quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). All quantification isotopes are determined in pulse mode to avoid cross-calibration. Small argide (Ar-40 Mg-26) interferences on Zn-66 are corrected by using two additional Mg and Zn standards. A stable signal, conducive for high-precision measurements, is obtained by cone conditioning. Variable calcium concentration has negligible effect on Li, Al, Mn, and Sr, but Ca concentrations for standards and samples need to be constrained at a similar level for precise measurements of Zn, Cd, and U. Aliquots of samples are first analyzed for Ca concentrations on an inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES), and the remaining solutions are diluted to Ca concentration of 100 ppm for ratio measurements to assure data quality. The long-term reproducibility of the method yielded precisions of Li/Ca = 2.4{\%}, B/Ca = 4.2{\%}, Mg/Ca = 1.4{\%}, Al/Ca = 14{\%}, Mn/Ca = 0.9{\%}, Zn/Ca = 2.8{\%} 1.2 similar to 7.8 mu mol/ mol) and 5.1{\%} (0.5 similar to 1.2 mu mol/mol), Sr/ Ca = 0.9{\%}, Cd/Ca = 2.4{\%} (0.07 similar to 0.24 mu mol/mol) and 4.8{\%} (0.01 similar to 0.07 mu mol/mol), and U/Ca = 2.5{\%} for foraminiferal samples as small as 60 mu g.},

abstract = {Although solid solutions play important roles in controlling the concentrations of minor metal ions in natural waters, uncertainties regarding their compositions, thermodynamics, and kinetics usually prevent them from being considered. A range of precipitation rates was used here to study the nonequilibrium and equilibrium partitioning behaviors of Sr2+, Ba2+, and Cd2+ to calcite (CaCO3(s)). The distribution coefficient of a divalent metal ion Me2+ for partitioning from an aqueous solution into calcite is given by DMe = (XMeCO3(s)/[Me2+])/(XCaCO3(s)/[Ca 2+]). The X values are solid-phase mole fractions; the bracketed values are the aqueous molal concentrations. In agreement with prior work, at intermediate to high precipitation rates R (nmol/mg-min), DSr, DBa, and DCd were found to depend strongly on R. At low R, the values of DSr, DBa, and DCd became constant with R. At 25??C, the equilibrium values for DSr, DBa, and DCd for dilute solid solutions were estimated to be 0.021 ?? 0.003, 0.012 ?? 0.005, and 1240 ?? 300, respectively. Calculations using these values were made to illustrate the likely importance of partitioning of these ions to calcite in groundwater systems. Due to its large equilibrium DMe value, movement of Cd2+ will be strongly retarded in aquifers containing calcite; Sr2+ and Ba2+ will not be retarded nearly as much.},

abstract = {The fast mixing of aqueous solutions of calcium chloride and sodium carbonate could immediately result in amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). Under vigorous stirring, the formed ACC in the precipitation system will dissolve first and, then, transform within minutes to produce crystalline forms of vaterite and calcite. After that, the solution-mediated mechanism dominates the transformation of the thermodynamically unstable vaterite into the thermodynamically stable calcite. Although ACC is the least stable form of the six anhydrous phases of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), it could be, however, produced and stabilized by a variety of organisms. To better understand the formation-transformation mechanism of ACC and vaterite into calcite, ex-situ methods (i.e., scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy) were used to characterize the formation-transformation process of ACC and vaterite in aqueous systems without organic additives, showing that ACC sampled at different conditions has different properties (i.e., lifetime, morphology, and spectrum characterization). It is also very interesting to capture the obviously polycrystalline particles of CaCO3 during the transformation process from vaterite to calcite, which suggests the formation mechanism for the calcite superstructure with multidimensional morphology. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {High-precision Mg isotope measurements by multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry were applied for determinations of magnesium isotopic fractionation of biogenic calcium carbonates from seawater with a rapid Mg purification technique. The mean $\delta$(26)Mg values of scleractinian corals, giant clam, benthic foraminifera, and calcite deep-sea corals were -0.87‰, -2.57‰, -2.34‰, and -2.43‰, suggesting preferential precipitation of light Mg isotopes to produce carbonate skeleton in biomineralization. Mg isotope fractionation in deep-sea coral, which has high Mg calcite skeleton, showed a clear temperature (T) dependence from 2.5 °C to 19.5 °C: 1,000 × ln($\alpha$) = -2.63 (±0.076) + 0.0138 (±0.0051) × T(R(2) = 0.82, p {\textless} 0.01). The $\delta$(26)Mg values of large benthic foraminifera, which are also composed of a high-Mg calcite skeleton, can be plotted on the same regression line as that for deep-sea coral. Since the precipitation rates of deep-sea coral and benthic foraminifera are several orders of magnitude different, the results suggest that kinetic isotope fractionation may not be a major controlling factor for high-Mg calcite. The Mg isotope fractionation factors and the slope of temperature dependence from deep-sea corals and benthic foraminifera are similar to that for an inorganically precipitated calcite speleothem. Taking into account element partitioning and the calcification rate of biogenic CaCO(3), the similarity among inorganic minerals, deep-sea corals, and benthic foraminiferas may indicate a strong mineralogical control on Mg isotope fractionation for high-Mg calcite. On the other hand, $\delta$(26)Mg in hermatypic corals composed of aragonite has been comparable with previous data on biogenic aragonite of coral, sclerosponges, and scaphopad, regardless of species differences of samples.},

abstract = {The physiological performance of two coccolithophore species, Emiliania huxleyi and Coccolithus braarudii, was investigated during long-term exposure to elevated pCO2 levels. Mono-specific cultures were grown over 152 (E. huxleyi) and 65 (C. braarudii) generations while pCO2 was gradually increased to maximum levels of 1150 $\mu$atm (E. huxleyi) and 930 $\mu$atm (C. braarudii) and kept constant thereafter. Rates of cell growth and cell quotas of particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) and total particulate nitrogen (TPN) were determined repeatedly throughout the incubation period. Increasing pCO2 caused a decrease in cell growth rate of 9{\%} and 29{\%} in E. huxleyi and C. braarudii, respectively. In both species cellular PIC:TPN and PIC:POC ratios decreased in response to rising pCO2, whereas no change was observed in the POC:TPN ratios of E. huxleyi and C. braarudii. These results are consistent with those obtained in shorter-term high CO2 exposure experiments following abrupt pertubations of the seawater carbonate system, indicating that for the strains tested here i) a gradual CO2 increase does not alleviate CO2/pH sensitivity, and ii) observed CO2 sensitivities are persistent over multiple generations.   },

Levels of phagocytosis increased significantly during the exposure period, suggesting an immune response induced by the experimental set-up. However, this induced stress response was suppressed when mussels were exposed to acidified sea water. Acidified sea water did not have any significant effects on other immuno-surveillance parameters measured (superoxide anion production, total and differential cell counts). These results suggest that ocean acidification may impact the physiological condition and functionality of the haemocytes and could have a significant effect on cellular signalling pathways, particularly those pathways that rely on specific concentrations of calcium, and so may be disrupted by calcium carbonate shell dissolution.},

abstract = {The formation and secretion of heterococcoliths by the non-motile life phase of the coccolithophore Coccolithus pelagicus was investigated using electron microscopy and time-lapse bright field imaging. Coccolithogenesis in C. pelagicus exhibited sequential mineralization of single coccoliths in Golgi-derived and nuclear-associated vesicles, a pattern similar to the formation of heterococcoliths in Emiliania huxleyi. Our TEM data show that only on maturation does the single coccolith vesicle migrate away from the nucleus before secretion. A reticular body, distinct from the Golgi body, was also clearly visible at the distal surface of the developing coccolith vesicle, suggesting this is a common structural feature in placolith cells that mineralize and secrete coccoliths one at a time. Time-lapse imaging revealed that the coccolith secretion process is rapid, taking 60-190 seconds, and involves considerable contractile activity to eject and position the coccolith on the surface of the cell. An intact flagellar root apparatus was discovered at the anterior pole of this non-motile cell from which polarized secretion of coccoliths occurs, which may indicate a novel role for such cytoskeletal structures. Freeze-fracture preparations revealed columnar deposits and adhesions linking the scales and coccolith baseplates to the cell, across the periplasmic space providing points of attachment for cellular movement. Rotatory movements of the cell relative to external coccoliths were exhibited by all actively calcifying cells. These movements enable the cell, while exhibiting morphologically polarized secretion, to locate and secrete a mature coccolith in a spatially well-defined manner. Finally, the time-lapse imaging approach described here provides an opportunity to quantify the regulation of coccolith production in single cells with high temporal resolution allowing responses of calcification to rapidly fluctuating environmental conditions such as light-dark transitions to be examined in detail, which has not been possible with bulk calcification studies.},

abstract = {Ostracod shells are valuable sources of calcite for geochemical analysis. Over the past two decades, research has provided much insight into the controls on trace-element partitioning and stable-isotope fractionation into ostracod shell calcite both in non-marine and marine settings. This chapter provides an overview of the con-trols and illustrates the application of the techniques to environmental reconstruc-tion using examples. Trace-element work has concentrated on Mg and Sr uptake, which relate to water chemistry and temperature, both in lakes and the oceans. Oxygen-and carbon-isotope analyses of ostracods have concentrated on lacustrine environments, from which other carbonate microfossils are largely absent. In hy-drologically-closed lakes, especially in dryland regions, geochemical signatures provide information on variations in hydrology, and may reflect changes in effec-tive precipitation. In temperate deep lakes with an isothermal hypolimnion and negligible evaporative enrichment, isotopic analyses of benthic ostracod shells re-flect the isotopic composition of lake water, which may reflect the regional pre-cipitation signal. In shallow hydrologically-open lakes, geochemical signatures are more complex, although Mg content of ostracod shells may reflect water tempera-ture, provided lake-water ionic composition has not changed. In marginal-marine environments, ostracod shell chemistry may indicate salinity changes that arise from mixing of marine and meteoric waters. Finally, in the deep oceans, the Mg content of benthic ostracods reflects ocean bottom-water temperature. In addition to these well-established approaches, ostracod shells also have potential as indicators of past metal pollution in the aquatic environment through measurements of heavy metal content of the shells, and as material for dating.},

Equations are derived for the calculation of sample concentrations and LOD when time-resolved data acquisition is employed, sensitivity calibration is obtained from reference materials with known analyte concentrations and naturally occurring internal standards are used to correct for the multiplicative correction factors of drift, matrix effects and the amount of material ablated and transported to the ICP.},

We also demonstrate how groups can make consensus decisions, even though informed individuals do not know whether they are in a majority or minority, how the quality of their information compareswith that of others, or even whether there are any other informed individuals.

It also predicts that (v) males on a restricted diet should accept fewer matings, (vi) testes size should shrivel during the day, (vii) the correlation coefficient between copulation duration and sequence number should decrease with increasing initial sperm reserve and with increasing number of copulations performed on a given day.$\backslash$nThere are two essential differences between our model and a model of Parker (1992). (i) Our model assumes that males optimize per day. Parker's model assumes that males optimize per mating bout, one bout comprising many days.

Tissue death in Montipora spp. appeared as a black layer that spread rapidly across the colony surface, though this appeared as the final phase of disease progression (with three previous disease phases now identified, S. Anthony, unpublished). Culture and molecular-based microbial analysis of this layer did not identify a likely microbial pathogen. Despite this, DNA sequencing of microbial 16S rDNA indicated a shift in the bacterial population associated with affected coral tissue. A clone library of the healthy coral sample predominantly contained sequences within the gamma-Proteobacteria. A disease coral sample representing the margin of the black lesion and healthy coral tissue was dominated by sequences, which demonstrated low sequence identity to a range of alpha-Proteobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria and cyanobacteria. The microbes identified in the diseased Montipora spp. samples are likely to be opportunistic rather than the causative agent of the observed lesion. Studies are in progress to further characterise the ecology of this disease and describe the potential microbial pathogen(s).},

abstract = {Central place foraging in ants is expected to maximize colony efficiency by minimizing the lengths of established trails. Short trails reduce both the time and energy costs of delivering food back to the nest, but which is most important? To examine trail route choice in the wood ant Formica rufa, we used a series of bridges, each with two alternative routes allowing the comparison of combinations of horizontal, vertical or time-expensive detours of differing lengths or delays. The ants preferred the shortest, quickest routes in all cases, although when vertical and horizontal deviations were equal in length they preferred the former, probably because this represents a reduced risk in terms of navigation errors. When comparing a range of bridge combinations, we were able to separate the relative differences in time versus energy saving represented within a series of successive choices. Contrary to earlier evidence, savings in energy explained significantly more of the variation in ant trail preferences than savings in time. We suggest that our results can be explained by wood ants adaptively adjusting their speed when walking in the vertical plane in response to the additional potential energy costs encountered.},

abstract = {Amorphous calcium carbonate is formed by a surprisingly large number of organisms, bearing in mind how unstable it is. Organisms use amorphous calcium carbonate as temporary storage sites for ions, as precursor phases that transform into more stable crystalline calcium carbonate polymorphs, or in a stabilized form for mechanical purposes. Here one example is examined that fulfils the latter function; the so-called antler shaped spicules formed by the ascidian Pyura pachydermatina. These spicules are composed of amorphous calcium carbonate containing 16{\%} (w/w) water and 14 mole{\%} phosphate. A detailed X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study of the calcium K-edge in the spicules shows a first co-ordination shell with seven/eight oxygen atoms, and a second co-ordination shell with four/five carbon atoms. The best fit was obtained using monohydrocalcite as model, and is consistent with a slightly expanded hydrated structure. It is noteworthy that the XAS spectrum of these spicules is quite different from that reported previously for the amorphous calcium carbonate of plant cystoliths. This raises the intriguing possibility that the biogenic amorphous phases differ structurally from each other, and that the differences can account for their diverse modes of formation and function.},

abstract = {Articulated fossil brachiopod shells have been used extensively to extract primary chemical information of Phanerozoic seawater. Despite the selection of well-preserved shells using trace element, microstructure and cathodoluminescence criteria, there are still concerns as to whether the selected brachiopod shells do indeed contain original seawater signals. Analyzed in-situ by Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LAICPMS), Sr, Na, Mg, Mn, B and Ba distribute symmetrically in shell transects of the modern brachiopods Magellania flavescens and Terebratulina septentrionalis. Symmetry of the trace element distribution pattern is considered an intrinsic and original ontogenetic property of the brachiopod shell chemistry. The trace element distribution is symmetrical in a well-preserved shell of the Devonian brachiopod Independatrypa lemma, indicating that the selected shell by the conventional criteria has preserved its original seawater signal for 400 Ma. In another specimen of I. lemma that is considered diagenetically altered, trace element concentrations are asymmetrically distributed in the shell. The agreement between the distribution criteria and the conventional methods indicates the latter can be used to select brachiopod shells with original seawater chemistry. The average element concentration in the whole shell of unaltered brachiopods should be a reflection of the seawater chemistry, while its change in different part of a shell reflects ontogenetic effect, and its high frequent fluctuations in a transect are results of changes in environmental parameters with seasonal or annual characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The “oceanic genotype” represents only the potential biological capacity and sets an upper constraint on pos- sible pathways and ecosystem rates. The realized structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, the “oceanic phenotype”, reflects the complex interactions of individuals and populations with their physical and chemical environment and with each other. A comprehensive exploitation of the wealth of new genomic data therefore requires a close synergy with interdisciplinary ocean research. Incorporating the information from environmental genomics, targeted process studies, and ocean observing systems into numerical models will improve predictions of the ocean's response to environmental perturbations.

abstract = {Permeability coefficients (Pm) across planar egg lecithin/decane bilayers and bulk hydrocarbon/water partition coefficients (Kw--{\textgreater}hc) have been measured for 24 solutes with molecular volumes, V, varying by a factor of 22 and Pm values varying by a factor of 10(7) to explore the chemical nature of the bilayer barrier and the effects of permeant size on permeability. A proper bulk solvent which correctly mimics the microenvironment of the barrier domain was sought. Changes in Pm/Kw--{\textgreater}hc were then ascribed to size-dependent partitioning and/or size-dependent diffusivity. The diffusion coefficient-size dependency was described by Dbarrier = Do/Vn. When n-decane was used as a reference solvent, the correlation between log Pm/Kw--{\textgreater}hc and log V was poor (r = 0.56) with most of the lipophilic (hydrophilic) permeants lying below (above) the regression line. Correlations improved significantly (r = 0.87 and 0.90, respectively) with more polarizable solvents, 1-hexadecene and 1,9-decadiene. Values of the size selectivity parameter n were sensitive to the reference solvent (n = 0.8 +/- 0.3, 1.2 +/- 0.1 and 1.4 +/- 0.2, respectively, for decane, hexadecene, and decadiene). Decadiene was selected as the most suitable reference solvent. The value for n in bilayer transport is higher than that for bulk diffusion in decane (n = 0.74 +/- 0.10), confirming the steep dependence of bilayer permeability on molecular size. Statistical mechanical theory recently developed by the authors suggests that a component of this steep size dependence may reside in size-dependent solute partitioning into the ordered chain region of bilayers. This theory, combined with the above diffusion model, yielded the relationship, Pm/Kw--{\textgreater}hc = D(o)exp(-alpha V)Vn. A fit of the experimental data to this model gave the best fit (r = 0.93) with alpha = 0.0053 +/- 0.0021 and n = 0.8 +/- 0.3, suggesting that both diffusion and partitioning mechanisms may play a role in determining the size dependence of lipid bilayer permeabilities.},

abstract = {Plate tectonics is the horizontal motion of Earth's thermal boundary layer (lithosphere) over the convecting mantle (asthenosphere) and is mostly driven by lithosphere sinking in subduction zones. Plate tectonics is an outstanding example of a self organizing, far from equilibrium complex system (SOFFECS), driven by the negative buoyancy of the thermal boundary layer and controlled by dissipation in the bending lithosphere and viscous mantle. Plate tectonics is an unusual way for a silicate planet to lose heat, as it exists on only one of the large five silicate bodies in the inner solar system. It is not known when this mode of tectonic activity and heat loss began on Earth. All silicate planets probably experienced a short-lived magma ocean stage. After this solidified, stagnant lid behavior is the common mode of planetary heat loss, with interior heat being lost by delamination and "hot spot" volcanism and shallow intrusions. Decompression melting in the hotter early Earth generated a different lithosphere than today, with thicker oceanic crust and thinner mantle lithosphere; such lithosphere would take much longer than at present to become negatively buoyant, suggesting that plate tectonics on the early Earth occurred sporadically if at all. Plate tectonics became sustainable (the modern style) when Earth cooled sufficiently that decompression melting beneath spreading ridges made thin oceanic crust, allowing oceanic lithosphere to become negatively buoyant after a few tens of millions of years. Ultimately the question of when plate tectonics began must be answered by information retrieved from the geologic record. Criteria for the operation of plate tectonics includes ophiolites, blueschist and ultra-high pressure metamorphic belts, eclogites, passive margins, transform faults, paleomagnetic demonstration of different motions of different cratons, and the presence of diagnostic geochemical and isotopic indicators in igneous rocks. This record must be interpreted individually; I interpret the record to indicate a progression of tectonic styles from active Archean tectonics and magmatism to something similar to plate tectonics at similar to 1.9 Ga to sustained, modern style plate tectonics with deep subduction - and powerful slab pull - beginning in Neoproterozoic time.},

abstract = {The shell secreted by molluscs is one of the most remarkable examples of a matrix-mediated mineralisation performed outside living tissues. The calcifying matrix is a mixture of proteins, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides that precisely self-assemble and control the CaCO3 polymorph (calcite, aragonite), the size, the shapes of the crystallites, and finally, the texture of the shell. In spite of several biochemical studies, the molecular aspects of the shell building are far from being understood. The present article makes an overview of the most recent molecular data on the proteinaceous components of the shell matrix. These data put into question the classical models of molluscan mineralisation. Furthermore, they show that shell proteins are diverse and multifunctional and that they may have different origins.

Its world-class authors provide guidance on all aspects of Bayesian data analysis and include examples of real statistical analyses, based on their own research, that demonstrate how to solve complicated problems. Changes in the new edition include: Stronger focus on MCMCRevision of the computational advice in Part IIINew chapters on nonlinear models and decision analysisSeveral additional applied examples from the authors' recent researchAdditional chapters on current models for Bayesian data analysis such as nonlinear models, generalized linear mixed models, and moreReorganization of chapters 6 and 7 on model checking and data collectionBayesian computation is currently at a stage where there are many reasonable ways to compute any given posterior distribution. However, the best approach is not always clear ahead of time. Reflecting this, the new edition offers a more pluralistic presentation, giving advice on performing computations from many perspectives while making clear the importance of being aware that there are different ways to implement any given iterative simulation computation. The new approach, additional examples, and updated information make Bayesian Data Analysis an excellent introductory text and a reference that working scientists will use throughout their professional life.},

All Rights Reserved.Compilations of paleoceanographic observations for the deep sea now contain a few hundred points along the oceanic margins, mid-ocean ridges, and bathymetric highs, where seawater conditions are indirectly recorded in the chemistry of buried benthic foraminiferal shells. Here we design an idealized experiment to test our predictive ability to reconstruct modern-day seawater properties by considering paleoceanographic-like data. We attempt to reconstruct the known, modern-day global distributions by using a state estimation method that combines a kinematic tracer transport model with observations that have paleoceanographic characteristics. When a modern-like suite of observations ($\Theta$, practical salinity, seawater $\delta$18O, $\delta$13CDIC, PO4, NO3, and O2) is used from the sparse paleolocations, the state estimate is consistent with the withheld data at all depths below 1500 m, suggesting that the observational sparsity can be overcome. Physical features, such as the interbasin gradients in deep $\delta$13CDIC and the vertical structure of Atlantic $\delta$13CDIC, are accurately reconstructed. The state estimation method extracts useful information from the pointwise observations to infer distributions at the largest oceanic scales (at least 10,000 km horizontally and 1500 m vertically) and outperforms a standard optimal interpolation technique even though neither dynamical constraints nor constraints from surface boundary fluxes are used. When the sparse observations are more realistically restricted to the paleoceanographic proxy observations of $\delta$13C, $\delta$18O, and Cd/Ca, however, the large-scale property distributions are no longer recovered coherently. At least three more water mass tracers are likely needed at the core sites in order to accurately reconstruct the large-scale property distributions of the Last Glacial Maximum.},

abstract = {Ice II, one of the high-pressure polymorphs of ice, d. 1.17, has 12H2O mols. in a rhombohedral unit cell with a 7.78 A., and alpha = 113.1 Deg. According to the Laue symmetry shown in single-crystal photographs, the space group should be either R.hivin.3m, R3m, or R32. Centrosymmetry is indicated by a statistical test with essentially 3-dimensional intensity data. However, the Patterson function indicates a pseudostructure in space group R.hivin.3c. The true structure must be appreciably distorted from this because of moderately strong violation of the c-glide extinction condition. The distortion could degrade the space group to R32, but the resulting structure has unsatisfactory features and does not conform well with the exptl. data. Structural reasoning indicates space group R.hivin.3. The observed R.hivin.3m Laue symmetry must therefore be the result of intimate twinning of R.hivin.3 individuals. The structure in R.hivin.3 can be refined, under the assumption of twinning, and with the inclusion of H atoms, to R = 0.08. The basic R.hivin.3c structure contains ice-I-like units built out of puckered "6-rings" of H2O-mols. These units are linked together in a more compact way than in ice I. Each O atom is bonded to 4 nearest neighbors at 2.80 +- 0.04 A. and has in addn. a nextnearest neighbor at 3.24 A. The distortion of the true structure from the pseudostructure leaves the bond lengths essentially unaltered but changes the bond angles appreciably. It constitutes evidence that the H atoms are in ordered arrangement in the crystal, rather than disordered, as in ice I. The particular ordered arrangement actually realized can be deduced from detailed features of the structure. This arrangement gives better agreement with the x-ray data than any other, although the x-ray distinction among various arrangements is necessarily marginal. The ordering energy in ice II, formulated in terms of the H.sbd.bond strain, must involve significantly the effects of both donor and acceptor misorientation. The acceptor strain energy contribution depends primarily not on deviation from tetrahedral bond orientation relative to the accepting H2O, but on deviation from the "accepting plane" that bisects the H.sbd.O.sbd.H angle of the mol. The H2O environment in ice II deviates greatly from an ideal tetrahedral one, yet the H.sbd.bond strain energy, although greater than in ice I, is small enough to be offset by the extra van der Waals energy, so that the energy of ice II is only 0.01 kcal./mole greater than that of ice I. The measured entropy difference between I and II is a direct reflection of the entropy of proton disorder in ice I. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {Minerals from the Hamersley banded iron formation, Western Australia, were analyzed for Y and rare earth elements (YREEs) by laser ablation ICP-MS to investigate diagenetic pathways, from precursor phases to BIF minerals. One group of apatites carries the seawater REE signature, giving evidence that P and REEs, thoroughly scavenged from the water column by Si-ferrihydrite particles, were released upon microbial Fe3+ reductive dissolution of Si-ferrihydrite in pore-water and finally sequestered mainly in authigenic apatite. The absence of fractionation between apatite and seawater suggests that REE were first incorporated into an amorphous calcium phosphate as fully hydrated cations, i.e. as outer-sphere complexes. The iron oxides and carbonates carry only a small fraction of the whole-rock REE budget. Their REE patterns are distinctly enriched in Yb and show some M-type tetrad effect consistent with experimental Kd(REE) between solid and saline solution with low carbonate ion concentrations. It is deduced that hematite formed at an incipient stage of Fe2+-catalyzed dissolution of Si-ferrihydrite, via a dissolution-reprecipitation pathway. The REE pattern of greenalite, found as sub-micron particles in quartz in a chert-siderite sample, is consistent with its authigenic origin by precipitation in pore-water after dissolution of a small amount of Si-ferrihydrite. Magnetite carries very low YREEs (ppb-level), has an homogeneous pattern distinctly enriched in the mid-REEs compared to hematite, and includes a late population depleted in light-REEs, Ba and As. Magnetite forming aggregates and massive laminae is tentatively interpreted as reflecting some fluid-aided hematite-magnetite re-equilibration or transformation at low-grade metamorphic temperatures.},

abstract = {The study of biomineralization is not only important to gain an understanding of how mineral- rich tissues are created in vivo but also because it is a great source of inspiration for the design of advanced materials.1-7 Mineralized tissues have remarkable hierarchical structures that have evolved over time to achieve great functions in a large variety of organisms. Organic phases play a key role in templating the structure of mineralized tissues; therefore, their matrices are often hybrid in composition, varying widely in the relative content of organic and inorganic substances. Understanding the complex integration of hard and soft phases that biology achieves in mineralized matrices across scales and its link to properties is knowledge of great value to materials chemistry. At the same time, the synthetic mechanisms used by biology to create mineralized matrices could also offer some useful strategies to create synthetic hybrid materials. Often, the amount of organic material utilized by Nature to modify mechanical properties of mineralized structures is vanishingly small. One example is the role of occluded proteins in the toughness of biogenic calcite.8 The study of mammalian bone and teeth in the biomineralization and biomimetic context is particularly interesting since the information derived could contribute a significant biomedical impact on therapies and strategies to repair or regenerate human mineralized tissues. This is an important area given the continually rising average life span of humans. The materials of interest could be highly sophisticated bioactive scaffolds to regenerate bone and possibly dental tissues as well. This review focuses on the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) in synthetic systems designed primarily in the biomimetic context of bone or enamel mineralization for therapeutic approaches in repair of human tissues. Bone and enamel share the same mineral composition, HA, but have different morphologies and organic content. Enamel is almost entirely inorganic in composition, and bone has a relatively high organic composition. Knowledge acquired in this field may inspire the chemical synthesis of novel hybrid materials, including apatite-based structures for the regeneration of human bone and dental tissues.},

abstract = {North Sea environmental and biological data were analysed to examine 30-year changes in production and consumption in the fish foodweb. The analysis revealed that the demand for secondary production placed on the ecosystem by fish declined from approximately 20 g C m-2 y-1 in the 1970s to 16 g C m-2 y-1 in the 1990s. Over the same period, the proportion of demand provided by zooplankton production increased from around 70{\%} to 75{\%}. The overall decrease was mainly due to a reduction in piscivorous demersal fish. Average secondary production by omnivorous zooplankton was estimated to be 35 g C m-2 y-1, and annual fluctuations were positively correlated with the gross production of planktivorous fish. The results suggest a "bottom-up" control of the pelagic foodweb. Individual planktivore species have been impacted by fishing, but the populations of other functionally similar species have expanded to fill the vacant niches, thus maintaining the planktivore role in the system. In contrast, the results indicate that benthos production was more "top-down" controlled. Overall, demersal fish species have been depleted by fishing, with no obvious species expansions to fill the vacant niche, releasing the benthos from predation pressure, and leading to an increase in benthic production and fisheries for invertebrates.

abstract = {Modern Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida, Thecideida and a few inarticulated brachiopods were collected live or soon after death at 30 locations from depths of 2-3940 m, from the equator to high latitudes covering the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Caribbean and Mediterranean Oceans/Seas. Well-preserved fibers of the secondary layer combined with Sr (450-1928 mg/kg), Mn (1-199 mg/kg) and Fe (1-610 mg/kg) contents confirm, with few exceptions, the excellent preservation of the modern brachiopod material. Evaluation of the stable isotope compositions was conducted on 276 specimens and on 374 published samples for a total database of 650 samples from 80 locations. It revealed that oxygen isotope incorporation into shell calcite (secondary layer) of modern articulated brachiopods, in most cases, occurs in equilibrium with the ambient water and as such reflects surrounding environmental conditions. Thecideida as a group (shallow water and low latitude) incorporate oxygen isotopes (-3.04‰ to +0.35‰) into shell calcite in equilibrium with their ambient water. A large majority of genera and species of the Terebratulida (shallow water and low-mid latitude) also incorporate oxygen (-2.30‰ to +3.48‰) into shell calcite in isotopic equilibrium with their surrounding water. In contrast, equilibrium incorporation of oxygen isotopes into shell calcite by the Rhynchonellida is uncertain, but a vital effect probably applies to the Craniida. The question of equilibrium/disequilibrium incorporation of carbon isotopes into shell calcite of modern brachiopods remains unresolved at this time. Isotope compositions range up to 4.5‰, 5.6‰ and 1.5‰ for $\delta$13C, and up to 5.5‰, 5.9‰ and 0.3‰ for $\delta$18O, for shallow-water low, mid, and high latitude brachiopods, respectively. Strontium isotopes of modern brachiopods, as expected, show no significant variation with location, latitude, water depth, temperature, salinity and general water conditions. Once local habitat and ecological influences of fossil brachiopods from similar latitudes are considered, their isotopic/elemental values should be valuable diagenetic indicators and important oceanographic/chemostratigraphic proxies. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The ability of the oceanic species to outgrow coastal ones at low [Zn2+] was due almost entirely to a reduced growth requirement for cellular Zn rather than to an increased capability for uptake. All isolates exhibited similar sigmoidal relationships between cellular Zn:C ratios and [Zn2+] with minimal slopes at [Zn2+] of 10(-10.5) to approximately 10(-9.5) M and increasing slopes above and below this range. The minimal slopes at intermediate [Zn2+] could be explained by negative feedback regulation of a high-affinity Zn uptake system, while increased slopes at high [Zn2+] appeared to be related to uptake by a low-affinity site. Measured relationships between cellular Zn:C ratios and [Zn2+] agreed well with those computed from a modified Redfield model based on depth profiles for Zn and PO4 concentrations and Zn chelation in the nutricline of the North Pacific. This agreement provides evidence that Zn concentrations in the nutricline are controlled by biological uptake and regeneration as occurs for major nutrients.},

The variations in ostracod Mg/Ca ratios reveal that fossil ostracod samples cleaned by ultrasonic methanol yield lower values than those by other methods, including increasingly rigorous reductive cleaning. In our sample sets, shell Mg/Ca decreases similar to 1.5 mmol/mol during clay removal. Sample Sr/Ca results do not seem to vary significantly under the equivalent cleaning steps. For ostracod analysis, pre-treatment using multiple methanol ultrasonic cleaning is suggested to be used for gaining an appropriate result.},

abstract = {The 20 standard amino acids (together with a few more that are not used in the biosynthesis of proteins) constitute a versatile tool box for synthesis of surfactants. Anionic, cationic and zwitterionic amphiphiles can be prepared and surfactants with several functional groups can be obtained by the proper choice of starting amino acid. This review gives examples of procedures used for preparation and discusses important physicochemical properties of the amphiphiles and how these can be taken advantage of for various applications. Micelles with a chiral surface can be obtained by self-assembly of enantiomerically pure surfactants and such supramolecular chirality can be utilized for asymmetric organic synthesis and for preparation of mesoporous materials with chiral pores. Surfactants based on amino acids with two carboxyl groups are effective chelating agents and can be used as collectors in mineral ore flotation. A surfactant based on cysteine readily oxidizes into the corresponding cystine compound, which can be regarded as a gemini surfactant. The facile and reversible cysteine-cystine transformation has been taken advantage of in the design of a switchable surfactant. A very attractive aspect of surfactants based on amino acids is that the polar head-group is entirely natural and that the linkage to the hydrophobic tail, which is often an ester or an amide bond, is easily cleaved. The rate of degradation can be tailored by the structure of the amphiphile. The ester linkage in betaine ester surfactants is particularly susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis and this surfactant type can be used as a biocide with short-lived action. This paper is not intended as a full review on the topic. Instead it highlights concepts that are unique to amino acid-based surfactants and that we believe can have practical implications.},

abstract = {Incorporation of boron into foraminiferal shells is thought to be primarily governed by the carbonate chemistry of the ambient seawater, suggesting that it can be reconstructed from B/Ca ratios. To this end, B/Ca ratios of the benthic foraminifer Planulina wuellerstorfi from South Atlantic core top samples have been analyzed using laser ablation−inductively coupled plasma−mass spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS) to provide additional information on intratest trace element heterogeneity. Results show that boron is heterogeneously distributed within and between shells, with content variations of approximately ±43{\%} displayed within a single shell. B/Ca is higher in the youngest chambers, opposite to the observed between-chamber vari- ability of Mg/Ca. This may be explained by ontogenetic changes of physiological processes that increase the pH of the calcifying fl uid and thus the borate concentration while decreasing Mg/Ca to promote calcifi cation. Despite this heterogeneity, mean B/Ca ratios are positively correlated with the deepwater calcite saturation state (∆[CO3 2–]), in line with previous studies. We apply this empirical relationship to reconstruct ∆[CO3 2–] for the late Pleistocene to Holo- cene using samples from a depth transect in the equatorial Atlantic. Reconstructed ∆[CO3 2–] values confi rm previous studies suggesting that CaCO3 -oversaturated North Atlantic Deep Water was reduced during glacial periods, whereas CaCO3 -undersaturated Antarctic Bottom Water expanded vertically and propagated northwards. In summary, our data demonstrate that bulk B/Ca in P. wuellerstorfi reliably refl ects variations in ∆[CO3 2–], despite the strong physiological control of boron incorporation.},

abstract = {Environmental variables such as temperature and salinity cannot be directly measured for the past. Such variables do, however, influence the chemistry and biology of the marine sedimentary record in a measurable way. Reconstructing the past environment is therefore possible by 'proxy'. Such proxy reconstruction uses chemical and biological observations to assess two aspects of Earth' climate system - the physics of ocean-atmosphere circulation, and the chemistry of the carbon cycle. Early proxies made use of faunal assemblages, stable isotope fractionation of oxygen and carbon, and the degree of saturation of biogenically produced organic molecules. These well-established tools have been complemented by many new proxies. For reconstruction of the physical environment, these include proxies for ocean temperature (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, $\delta$44Ca) and ocean circulation (Cd/Ca, radiogenic isotopes, 14C, sortable silt). For reconstruction of the carbon cycle, they include proxies for ocean productivity (231Pa/230Th, U concentration); nutrient utilization (Cd/Ca, $\delta$15{\textgreater}N, $\delta$30Si); alkalinity (Ba/Ca); pH ($\delta$11B); carbonate ion concentration (foraminiferal weight, Zn/Ca); and atmospheric CO2 ($\delta$11B, $\delta$13C). These proxies provide a better understanding of past climate, and allow climate-model sensitivity to be tested, thereby improving our ability to predict future climate change. Proxy research still faces challenges, however, as some environmental variables cannot be reconstructed and as the underlying chemistry and biology of most proxies is not well understood. Few proxies have been applied to pre-Pleistocene times - another challenge for future research. Only by solving such challenges will proxies provide a full understanding of the range of possible climate variability on Earth and of the mechanisms causing this variability. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {A method has been developed using laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for rapid high resolution analysis of B, Mg, Sr, Ba, and U in corals. Corals represent a challenge for a microbeam technique due to their compositional and structural heterogeneity, their nonsilicate matrix, and their unusual range of trace element compositions relative to available standards. The method employs an argon-fluoride excimer laser (lambda = 193 nm), masked to produce a beam 600 mu m wide by 20 mu m across to average ablation sampling over a range of structural features. Coral sections are scanned at a constant rate beneath the laser to produce a continuous sampling of the coral surface. Sensitivity drift is controlled by careful preconditioning of the ICP-MS to carbonate material, and standardisation is carried out by bracketing each traverse down the coral sample by analyses of a CaSiO3 glass synthesised from coral powder. The method demonstrates excellent reproducibility of both the shape and magnitude of coralline trace element profiles, with typical precisions of between 1.0 and 3.7{\%} based on analysis of the synthetic standard. Accuracy varies between 3.8{\%} for B and 31{\%} for U. Discrepancies are attributed to heterogeneities in the: synthetic standard, and matrix differences between the silicate standard and carbonate sample. The method is demonstrated by analysis of a coral collected from Australia's Great Barrier Reef near a weather station recording in-situ sea-surface-temperature (SST), The elements B, Mg, Sr, and U show seasonal compositional cycles, and tentative calibrations against SST have been derived. Using independent ICP-MS solution estimates of the coral composition to correct for standardisation uncertainties, the following calibrations have been derived: B/Ca (mu mol/mol)= 1000 (+/-20) - 20.6 (+/-0.8) x SST Mg/Ca (mmol/mol)= 0.0 (+/-0.3) + 0.16 (+/-0.01) x SST Sr/Ca (mmol/mol)= 10.8 (+/-0.1) - 0.070 (+/-0.004)x SST U/Ca (mu mol/mol) = 2.24 (+/-0.07) - 0.046 (+/-0.003) x SST1 These calibrations agree with literature within experimental errors, except for ME which displays a 35{\%} greater temperature dependence than reported previously.

These measurements, the first made in conjunction with calcification temperature (magnesium/calcium ratios) and average shell mass measurements, indicate that pH is not the sole environmental variable controlling B in planktonic foraminiferal calcite. Our data are consistent with calcification temperature exerting a primary control on B concentration and isotopic composition in planktonic foraminifera. If so, calcification temperature must be taken into account if pH for past oceans and atmospheric pCO2 are to be estimated from B isotope measurements in foraminiferal calcite. Doing so will substantially increase the uncertainty of pH estimates. Although this work was designed as a temporal study, its results define new aspects of calibrating the d11B paleo-pH tracer.},

We characterize the first extremely acidic proteins purified from biomineralized aragonite. These abalone nacre proteins are two variants of 8.7 and 7.8 kDa designated AP8 (for aragonite proteins of approximately 8 kDa). The AP8 proteins have compositions dominated by Asx ( approximately 35 mol {\%}) and Gly ( approximately 40 mol {\%}) residues, suggesting that their structures have high Ca(2+)-binding capacity and backbone flexibility. The growth of asymmetrically rounded CaCO(3) crystals in the presence of AP8 reveals that both proteins preferentially interact with specific locations on the crystal surface. In contrast, CaCO(3) crystals grown with nacre proteins depleted of AP8 retain the morphology of unmodified calcite rhombohedra. Our observations thus identify sites of protein-mineral interaction and provide evidence to support the long-standing theory that acidic proteins are more effective crystal-modulators than other proteins from the same biomineralized material.},

abstract = {Synapsin I (protein I) is a major neuron-specific endogenous substrate for cAMP-dependent and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases that is widely distributed in synapses of the central and peripheral nervous system (De Camilli, P., R. Cameron, and P. Greengard, 1983, J. Cell Biol. 96:1337-1354). We have now carried out a detailed analysis of the ultrastructural localization of synapsin I in the synapse. For this purpose we have developed a novel immunocytochemical technique that involves the labeling of isolated synaptosomes immobilized in a thin agarose gel. Special fixation conditions were designed to maximize accessibility of synapsin I to marker molecules. Immunoferritin and immunoperoxidase studies of this preparation indicated that synapsin I is localized in the presynaptic compartment and that it is present in close to 100{\%} of all nerve endings. Immunoferritin labeling also indicated that, inside the nerve ending, synapsin I is specifically associated with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles. In agreement with these immunoferritin results, the labeling produced by immunoperoxidase was compatible with a specific association of synapsin I with synaptic vesicle membranes. However, at variance with the very specific distribution of immunoferritin, immunoperoxidase reaction product was also found on other membranes of the terminals, presumably as a result of its diffusion over a short distance from the synaptic vesicles. Anti-synapsin I immunoperoxidase staining of tissue sections for electron microscopy produced an uneven labeling of terminals of the neuropile, in agreement with results of a previous study (Bloom, F. E., T. Ueda, E. Battenberg, and P. Greengard, 1979, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 76:5982-5986). A comparison with results obtained in isolated synapses indicates that the limited labeling of nerve endings in tissue sections results from limited and uneven penetration by marker molecules. The specific association of synapsin 1 with synaptic vesicle membranes in the great majority of nerve terminals suggests a prominent role for this phosphoprotein in the regulation of synaptic vesicle function.},

Stem cell maintenance is an active process requiring constant communication between neighboring groups of SAM cells. Information flows via a ligand-receptor signal transduction pathway, resulting in the formation of a spatial feedback loop that stabilizes the size of the stem cell population. Termination of stem cell activity during flower development is achieved by a temporal feedback loop involving both stem cell maintenance genes and flower patterning genes.

Efforts to address climate change have primarily focused on mitigation, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and more recently on addressing the impacts of climate changeadaptation. However, international political consensus on the need to reduce emissions has been very slow in coming, and there is as yet no agreement on the emissions reductions needed beyond 2012. As a result global emissions have continued to increase by about 3{\%} per year (Raupach et al. 2007), a faster rate than that projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (IPCC 2001)7 even under its most fossil fuel intensive scenario (A1FI8) in which an increase in global mean temperature of about 4C (2.4 to 6.4C) by 2100 is projected (Rahmstorf et al. 2007). The scientifi c community is now becoming increasingly concerned that emissions will not be reduced at the rate and magnitude required to keep the increase in global average temperature below 2C (above pre-industrial levels) by 2100. Concerns with the lack of progress of the political processes have led to increasing interest in geoengineering approaches. This Royal Society report presents an independent scientifi c review of the range of methods proposed with the aim of providing an objective view on whether geoengineering could, and should, play a role in addressing climate change, and under what conditions.},

abstract = {The osmo-ionoregulatory responses of sub- adult Port Jackson sharks, Heterodontus portusjacksoni (Meyer, 1793), and the stingaree Trygonoptera testacea (Mu{\`{E}} ller and Henle, 1841), were investigated following the transfer from full-strength seawater (100{\%} SW) to either 75 or 50{\%} SW for up to 168 h. The plasma os- motic pressure was similarly reduced in both species and remained slightly hyper-osmotic to the diluted seawater after 168 h. The increase in the body weight of H. portusjacksoni transferred to diluted seawater was double that of T. testacea, with the greater haemodilu- tion re¯ected by a short-term reduction in haematocrit and in haemoglobin concentration. The haemodilution exhibited by H. portusjacksoni also resulted in a greater reduction in plasma [Na], [Cl], [urea] and [trimethyl- amine oxide] compared with T. testacea. The ability of T. testacea to minimize body-weight gain in diluted seawater was most probably due to increased net water e ux. The persistent elevation in the body weight of both species, despite the apparent recovery of plasma- water volume, was indicative of elevated tissue water. Chronic exposure of H. portusjacksoni to 50{\%} SW altered erythrocyte ion concentrations and plasma/ery- throcyte ion ratios, which could have serious implica- tions for cellular homeostasis, respiratory gas transport and acid-base status. The greater control of water and ionic status exhibited by T. testacea, compared with that of H. portusjacksoni, allows the stingarees to penetrate into the more dilute, upper estuarine waters.},

abstract = {A procedure is described for forming a flat face on a frozen piece of plant tissue, which may then be observed fully-hydrated or lightly etched, and coated or uncoated with a metal film, in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The frozen sample was planed with a glass knife at -80 degrees C in a cryo-ultramicrotome. The sections were discarded, and the planed block face placed on the cold stage in the microscope column, either for observation uncoated at low kV, or for light etching (-90 degrees C) to reveal the cell outlines. If a higher accelerating voltage was needed, the face was given an evaporative coating of Al in the cryo-preparation chamber and returned to the column. The advantages of the planed face over the usual fracture face are illustrated: imaging at a chosen rather than a chance position; clearer cellular and subcellular detail; preservation of hydrated gels like mucilage and swollen cell walls; the possibility of making serial parallel sections through the same piece of tissue; opportunities for accurate morphometric analyses on the planed face; capacity to produce longitudinal sections; preservation of very delicate structures that are destroyed by fixation and drying. A major advantage of the Al-coated planed face is the increased accuracy of energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalyses on a smooth rather than a rough surface. Tests are included which show that neither the light etching employed, nor successive planing, interferes with the analyses of elements in the frozen face. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Melt ponds are an important characteristic of Arctic sea ice because of their control on the surface radiation balance. Little is known about the physical nature of these features and to date there is no operational method for detection of their formation or estimation of their aerial fraction. Coincident in situ observations, aerial surveys and synthetic aperture radar data from a field site in Arctic Canada are compared in an evaluation of the physical, radiative and electrical properties of melt ponds on first-year and multiyear sea ice. Results show that the interrelationships between the thermal diffusivity and conductivity of the snow cover control the mechanisms of snow ablation. Aerial fractions of snow patches, and light and dark coloured melt ponds, show considerable variation both as a function of proximity to land and due to ice type. First-year sea ice is shown to have a water background with discrete snow patches distributed throughout. Multiyear sea ice consists of discrete 'particles' within a snow background. Morphological measurements indicate that snow patches range in size with average areas of from 5 to 20 m(2). Pond sizes over multiyear sea ice are also highly variable with averages ranging from 15 to 20 m(2). The integrated shortwave albedo was measured in the field and averaged to: snow patches (0.64+/-0.07); light melt ponds (0.29 +/- 0.04); and dark melt ponds (0.14 +/- 0.03). Snow patch size statistics explained a statistically significant proportion of the surface shortwave albedo. We found that microwave scattering could be used to obtain a measure of the onset of melt and had utility in detecting subtle details of the thermodynamic transition from winter through early melt into pond formation. We formalized a statistical relationship between microwave scattering and surface climatological albedo (sigma degrees-alpha relationship). We found the relationship valid only for landfast first-year sea ice under windy conditions. We conclude with a discussion of the role of surface wind stress and diurnal cycling in specification of the sigma degrees-alpha relationship.},

abstract = {1 Over the past decade, the ratio of Mg to Ca in foraminiferal tests has emerged as a valuable paleotemperature proxy. However, large uncertainties remain in the relationships between benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca and temperature. Mg/Ca was measured in benthic foraminifera from 31 high-quality multicore tops collected in the Florida Straits, spanning a temperature range of 5.8 degrees to 18.6 degrees C. New calibrations are presented for Uvigerina peregrina, Planulina ariminensis, Planulina foveolata, and Hoeglundina elegans. The Mg/Ca values and temperature sensitivities vary among species, but all species exhibit a positive correlation that decreases in slope at higher temperatures. The decrease in the sensitivity of Mg/Ca to temperature may potentially be explained by Mg/Ca suppression at high carbonate ion concentrations. It is suggested that a carbonate ion influence on Mg/Ca may be adjusted for by dividing Mg/Ca by Li/Ca. The Mg/Li ratio displays stronger correlations to temperature, with up to 90{\%} of variance explained, than Mg/Ca alone. These new calibrations are tested on several Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) samples from the Florida Straits. LGM temperatures reconstructed from Mg/Ca and Mg/Li are generally more scattered than core top measurements and may be contaminated by high-Mg overgrowths. The potential for Mg/Ca and Mg/Li as temperature proxies warrants further testing.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification is expected to lower the net accretion of coral reefs yet little is known about its effect on coral photophysiology. This study investigated the effect of increasing CO2 on photosynthetic capacity and photoprotection in Acropora formosa. The photoprotective role of photorespiration within dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium) has largely been overlooked due to focus on the presence of a carbon-concentrating mechanism despite the evolutionary persistence of a Form II Rubisco. The photorespiratory fixation of oxygen produces phosphoglycolate that would otherwise inhibit carbon fixation though the Calvin cycle if it were not converted to glycolate by phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGPase). Glycolate is then either excreted or dealt with by enzymes in the photorespiratory glycolate and/or glycerate pathways adding to the pool of carbon fixed in photosynthesis. We found that CO2 enrichment led to enhanced photoacclimation (increased chlorophyll a per cell) to the subsaturating light levels. Light-enhanced dark respiration per cell and xanthophyll de-epoxidation increased, with resultant decreases in photosynthetic capacity (Pnmax) per chlorophyll. The conservative CO2 emission scenario (A1B; 600–790 ppm) led to a 38{\%} increase in the Pnmax per cell whereas the ‘business-as-usual' scenario (A1F1; 1160–1500 ppm) led to a 45{\%} reduction in PGPase expression and no change in Pnmax per cell. These findings support an important functional role for PGPase in dinoflagellates that is potentially compromised under CO2 enrichment.},

abstract = {The high spatial resolution of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) microanalysis of speleothems and biogenic calcium carbonates makes it possible to improve our understanding of past climatic conditions. However, there are analytical problems associated with this method, such as molecular interferences, elemental fractionation, and mass-load-dependent matrix effects, when using NIST silicate reference glasses for calibration.Our study with a sector-field ICP-MS shows that many masses are affected by interferences, such as 24Mg + by 48Ca ++ or 31P + by 15N 16O +. Elemental fractionation and mass-load-dependent matrix effects have been detected for both 213 and 193nm Nd:YAG lasers. They are small for refractory lithophile elements, in particular for the 193nm laser ({\textless}5{\%}). For chalcophile/siderophile trace elements with low boiling points, however, these effects are large (up to 40{\%} and 20{\%} for the 213 and 193nm lasers, respectively), and variable for the NIST glasses and carbonates.In this paper, a protocol for precise and accurate LA-ICP-MS analysis of calcium carbonates is established. Isotopes for interference-free measurements at low (M/$\delta$M {\~{}}. 300) and medium (M/$\delta$M {\~{}}. 4000) mass resolution have been identified. The NIST glasses are suitable for calibration of refractory lithophile element concentrations. However, matrix-matched calibration with carbonate reference materials, such as USGS MACS-1 or MACS-3, is necessary for accurate analysis of chalcophile/siderophile elements with low boiling points. Analytical reproducibility (RSD) is a factor of {\~{}}. 2 better using the 193. nm laser than the 213. nm laser. As shown by the analysis of MACS-1 and MACS-3, LA-ICP-MS analyses yield results that agree with the reference values within relative uncertainties of ca. 5-10{\%} at the 95{\%} confidence level.We have applied LA-ICP-MS for the determination of trace element concentrations in calcite and aragonite layers of a stalagmite and found large variations for Mg, Zn, Sr, and U. In ostracod shells, the concentrations of some trace elements (. e.g., Sr and Ba) vary significantly, indicating the potential for paleoclimate research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The calcium phosphates and oxalates are among the most frequently encountered biomineral phases and numerous kinetics studies have been made of their crystallization and dissolution in supersaturated and undersaturated solutions, respectively. These have focused mainly on parameters such as solution composition, ionic strength, pH, temperature, and solid surface characteristics. There is considerable interest in extending such studies to solutions more closely simulating the biological milieu. The constant composition method is especially useful for investigating the mechanisms of these reactions, and in the present work, the interfacial tensions between water and each of these surfaces have been calculated from measured contact angles using surface tension component theory. Values for the calcium phosphate phases such as dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD), octacalcium phosphate (OCP), hydroxyapatite (HAP), and fluorapatite (FAP) may be compared with data calculated from dissolution kinetics experiments invoking different reaction mechanisms. Agreement between the directly measured interfacial energies and those calculated from the kinetics experiments provides valuable corroborative information about individual growth and dissolution mechanisms. For the calcium phosphates, the much smaller interfacial tensions of OCP and DCPD in contact with water as compared with those of HAP and FAP support the suggestion that the former phases are precursors in HAP and FAP biomineralization. The ability of a surface to nucleate mineral phases is closely related to the magnitude of the interfacial energies. Constant composition studies have also shown that HAP is an effective nucleator of calcium oxalate monohydrate, both of which are frequently observed in renal stones.},

abstract = {The extent to which calcium carbonate deposition in an anaerobic reactor can be reduced by adding inhibitors (phosphate and iron) of calcium carbonate crystal growth was investigated. At several concentrations of the additive, the extent of precipitation was assessed in continuous experiments with laboratory-scale reactors. In the reactor, phosphate concentrations as low as 0.5-5 mg total-P dm-3 were found to severely inhibit CaCO3 precipitation. However, iron did not inhibit the deposition of CaCO3, which was found to be due to the fact that iron, in contrast to phosphate, only inhibits the growth of calcite and not the formation of aragonite. The results led to the conclusion that only additives which inhibit the formation of both aragonite and calcite can be used as effective inhibitors during anaerobic digestion. A chemical equilibrium model was developed and shown to be a useful tool to calculate the extent of calcium carbonate deposition during anaerobic digestion provided the proper apparent solubility product of calcium carbonate can be estimated.{\textcopyright} 1999 Society of Chemical Industry},

Because so many biomineral products are derived from an initial solution phase and are either completely crystalline or include crystalline components, an understanding of the physical principles of crystallization from solutions is an important tool for students of biomineralization. However, crystal growth is a science of great breadth and depth, about which many extensive texts have been written. In addition, there are already other thorough reviews that specifically address the crystal growth field of study as it relates to biomineral formation. Consequently, the goals of this chapter are both modest and specific. It is intended to provide: 1) a simple narrative explaining the physical principles behind crystallization for those who are completely new to the topic, 2) a few basic equations governing nucleation and growth for those who wish to apply those principlesat least in a semi-quantitative fashionto experimental observations of mineralization, and 3) an overview of some recent molecular-scale studies that have revealed new insights into the control of crystal growth by small molecules, both organic and inorganic.},

abstract = {We analyzed the redox sensitive elements V, Mo, U, Re and Cd in surface sediments from the Northwest African margin, the U.S. Northwest margin and the Arabian Sea to determine their response under a range of redox conditions. Where oxygen penetrates 1 cm or less into the sediments, Mo and V diffuse to the overlying water as Mn is reduced and remobilized. Authigenic enrichments of U, Re and Cd are evident under these redox conditions. With the onset of sulfate reduction, all of the metals accumulate authigenically with Re being by far the most enriched. General trends in authigenic metal accumulation are described by calculating authigenic fluxes for the 3 main redox regimes: oxic, reducing where oxygen penetrates ???1 cm, and anoxic conditions. Using a simple diagenesis model and global estimates of organic carbon rain rate and bottom water oxygen concentrations, we calculate the area of sediments below 1000 m water depth in which oxygen penetration is ???1 cm to be 4{\%} of the ocean floor. We conclude that sediments where oxygen penetrates ???1 cm release Mn, V and Mo to seawater at rates of 140{\%}-260{\%}, 60{\%}-150{\%} and 5{\%}-10{\%} of their respective riverine fluxes, using the authigenic metal concentrations and accumulation rates from this work and other literature. These sediments are sinks for Re, Cd and U, with burial fluxes of 70{\%}-140{\%}, 30{\%}-80{\%} and 20{\%}-40{\%}, respectively, of their dissolved riverine inputs. We modeled the sensitivity of the response of seawater Re, Cd and V concentrations to changes in the area of reducing sediments where oxygen penetrates ???1 cm. Our analysis suggests a negligible change in seawater Re concentration, whereas seawater concentrations of Cd and V could have decreased and increased, respectively, by 5{\%}-10{\%} over 20 kyr if the area of reducing sediments increased by a factor of 2 and by 10{\%}-20{\%} if the area increased by a factor of 3. The concentration variations for a factor of 2 increase in the area of reducing sediments are at about the level of uncertainty of Cd/Ca and V/Ca ratios observed in foraminifera shells over the last 40 kyr. This implies that the area of reducing sediments in the ocean deeper than 1000 m (4{\%}) has not been greater than twice the present value in the recent past.},

Over the past year, fundamental insights into the molecular basis of this process have been gained. Patterns of auxin polar transport dictate when and where new leaf primordia are formed on the surface of the apical meristem. Subsequent events are still obscure but appear to involve both alteration of cell wall characteristics (to facilitate a new vector of growth) and a cascade of spatially co-ordinated transcription factor activity (to determine the fate of cells that are incorporated into new lateral organs). The co-ordinated signalling events involved in these processes are beginning to be elucidated.},

abstract = {The lithium isotopic composition of foraminifera is an established tracer of long-term changes in the global silicate weathering cycle, following the assumption that foraminifera faithfully record the lithium isotopic composition ($\delta$ 7 Li) of seawater. In this study, we demonstrate by utilising benthic foraminifera (Amphistegina lessonii) that were cultured under decoupled pH-[CO 32– ] conditions, that foraminifera $\delta$ 7 Li is strongly dependent on pH. This is reinforced with $\delta$ 7 Li data from globally distributed core-top samples of Cibicidoides mundulus and Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi, which show the same negative correlation with pH. The dependency of $\delta$ 7 Li on pH is perhaps a surprising result given that lithium speciation in seawater is independent of both pH and carbonate ion speciation. The dependence of lithium incorporation on growth rate was assessed by measuring the calcium isotopic composition; no growth rate dependent incorporation was observed. Instead, we propose that the strength of the 6 Li and 7 Li hydration spheres (and hence their respective desolvation energy) is pH-dependent, resulting in a significant isotopic fractionation during the incorporation of lithium into foraminifer calcite. The core-top derived $\delta$ 7 Li-pH calibration is used to demonstrate the applicability of this $\delta$ 11 B-independent pH proxy in reconstructing deglacial variations in pH in the South Pacific. The use of foraminifera $\delta$ 7 Li to compliment $\delta$ 11 B-based pH reconstructions has the potential to provide insight into time-dependent variations in porewater/seawater $\delta$ 11 B, temperature and salinity, which were previously unresolvable.},

abstract = {Coccolithophorid algae are microscopic but prolific calcifiers in modern and ancient oceans. When the pH of seawater is modified, as may occur in the future due to ocean acidification, different species and strains of coccolithophorids have exhibited diverse calcification responses in laboratory culture. Since their biomineralization is a completely intracellular process, it is unclear why their response should be affected by extracellular seawater pH. Variations in the B/Ca in coccoliths are potential indicators of pH shifts in the intracellular coccolith vesicle where calcification occurs, because B/Ca in abiogenic calcites increases at higher pH due to the greater abundance of borate ions, the only B species incorporated into calcite. We used a SIMS ion probe to measure B/Ca of coccoliths from three different strains of Emiliania huxleyi and one strain of Coccolithus braarudii braarudii cultured under different seawater pH conditions to ascertain if the B/Ca can be used to elucidate how coccolithophorids respond to changing ocean pH. These data are interpreted with the aid of a conceptual model of cellular boron acquisition by coccolithophorids. Based on uptake in other plants, we infer that boron uptake by coccolithophorid cells is dominated by passive uptake of boric acid across the lipid bilayer. Subsequently, in the alkaline coccolith vesicle (C.V.), boron speciates according to the C.V. pH, and borate is incorporated into the coccolith. At increasing seawater pH, the relative abundance of the neutral boric acid in seawater decreases, lowering the potential B flux into the cell. Homeostasis or constant pH of the coccolith vesicle results in a decrease of the B/Ca in the coccolith with increasing seawater pH. In contrast, if coccolith vesicle pH increases with increasing seawater pH, then the B/Ca will increase as the fraction of borate in the coccolith vesicle increases. The coccolith B/Ca is also expected to depend inversely on the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration in the coccolith vesicle. The B/Ca in cultured coccoliths is much lower than that of foraminifera or corals and limits precision in the analysis. Modest variations in DIC or pH of the coccolith vesicle can account for the observed trends in B/Ca in cultured coccoliths. The model shows that paired measurements of B/Ca and B isotopic composition of the calcite could distinguish between regulation of pH or DIC in the coccolith vesicle. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The estuary of the Limmen Eight River in Australia's Northern Territory is home to an unusual salt water-adapted population of the Australian 'freshwater' crocodile, Crocodylus johnstoni. Crocodiles were captured from tidal reaches of the estuary ranging in salinity from 0.5-24 parts per thousand and from several permanent fresh water reaches more or less remote from saline waters. C. johnstoni is an effective osmoregulator in moderately saline waters and has osmoregulatory mechanisms very similar to its more marine-adapted relative, the estuarine crocodile Crocodylus porosus. Fasted C. johnstoni in brackish water appear to lose little sodium in cloacal urine, relying on their lingual salt glands for excretion of excess sodium chloride. The lingual glands show clear evidence of short-term and long-term acclimation to salt water. Like estuarine crocodiles, C. johnstoni drinks fresh water and will not drink sea water. Gross sodium and water fluxes in brackish water are very similar to those in other crocodilians, suggesting differences in integumental permeability are not a major influence on osmoregulatory differences between crocodilians. The data reinforce the hypothesis that crocodylids differ fundamentally from alligatorids in the structure and function of the renal-cloacal-salt gland complex and are of interest in current debate over the evolutionary and zoogeographical history of the eusuchian crocodilians.

Given reasonable assumptions about the isotopic composition of Cretaceous seawater, our results suggest that middle bathyal water temperatures at Blake Nose increased from similar to12 degreesC in the late Albian through middle Cenomanian to a maximum of 20 degreesC during the latest Cenomanian and earliest Turonian. Bottom waters were again similar to12 degreesC during the middle Campanian and cooled to a minimum of 9 T during the Maastrichtian. Correlative middle bathyal foraminifera from other ocean basins yield paleotemperature estimates that are very similar to those from Blake Nose. Comparison of global bottom-water temperatures and latitudinal thermal gradients suggests that global climate changed from a warm greenhouse state during the late Albian through late Cenomanian to a hot greenhouse phase during the latest Cenomanian through early Campanian, then to cool greenhouse conditions during the mid-Campanian through Maastrichtian.},

abstract = {Cyanobacteria have developed an effective photosynthetic CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) for improving the efficiency of carboxylation by a relatively inefficient Rubisco. The development of this CCM was presumably in response to the decline in atmospheric CO2 levels and rising O2, both of which were triggered by the development of oxygenic photosynthesis by cyanobacteria themselves. In the past few years there has been a rapid expansion in our understanding of the mechanism and genes responsible for the CCM. In addition, there has been a recent expansion in the availability of complete cyanobacterial genomes, thus increasing our potential to examine questions regarding both the evolution and diversity of components of the CCM across cyanobacteria. This paper considers various CCM and photosynthesis gene components across eight cyanobacteria where significant genomic information is available. Significant conclusions from our analysis of the distribution of various genes indicated the following. Firstly, cyanobacteria have developed with two types of carboxysomes, and this is correlated with the form of Rubisco present. We have coined the terms $\alpha$-cyanobacteria to refer to cyanobacteria containing Form 1A Rubisco and $\alpha$-carboxysomes, and $\beta$-cyanobacteria having Form 1B Rubisco and $\beta$-carboxysomes. Secondly, there are two NDH-1 CO2 uptake systems distributed variably, withProchlorococcus marinus species appearing to lack this CO2 uptake system. There are at least two HCO3– transport systems distributed variably, with some $\alpha$-cyanobacteria having an absence of systems identified in $\beta$-cyanobacteria. Finally, there are multiple forms of carbonic anhydrases (CAs), but with only $\beta$-carboxysomal CA having a clearly shown role at present. The $\alpha$-cyanobacteria appear to lack a clearly identifiable carboxysomal CA. A pathway for the evolution of cyanobacterial CCMs is proposed. The acquisition of carboxysomes triggered by the rapid decline of atmospheric CO2 in the Phanerozoic is argued to be the initial step. This would then be followed by the development of NDH-1 CO2-uptake systems, followed by the development of low-and high-affinity HCO3– transporters. An intriguing question is, were carboxysomes developed first in cyanobacteria, or did they originate by the lateral transfer of pre-existing proteobacterial bacterial microcompartment genes? The potentially late evolution of the CCM genes in cyanobacteria argues for a polyphyletic and separate evolution of CCMs in cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants.},

Sargasso Sea and northeast Pacific deep water samples have about one-fourth those concentrations; concentrations in the North Atlantic western boundary current appear intermediate. The data suggest that manganese is removed from seawater more rapidly than the general oceanic turnover time of about 1,500 years. Downward transport of manganese in downwelling surface water and falling biogenic debris can supply only a few per cent of the total amount accumulating in pelagic sediments, although it can supply all the manganese accumulating in ferromanganese crusts and nodules. A Sargasso Sea and a northeast Pacific profile show no indication of a deep water manganese maximum, suggesting that submarine volcanism and hydrothermal input is not a major source of manganese to either deep ocean water or normal pelagic sediments. Because the sedimentary manganese is supplied neither by dissolved manganese in seawater nor by hydrothermal inputs, we conclude that the 'excess' manganese in pelagic sediments comes from terrigenous particles. ?? 1977.},

The largest surface area and the highest P adsorption at 20 °C and pH 7 was obtained for M BC prepared at 700 °C and at the longer residence time, compared to the SC BC made under the same conditions (approximately 15.5 mg g-1 and 12.8 mg g-1 for 400 mg dm-3 phosphate in solution, respectively). Adsorption of P on BCs was endothermic and increased with process temperature. The amount of desorbed P was proportional to its adsorption capacity. Two isotherm models (Freundlich and Langmuir) fitted the experimental results of phosphate adsorption onto the BC, and the Langmuir adsorption model described it better. Thermodynamic parameters are compared in the text with phosphate adsorption on other BCs reported in the literature. Our data suggest that adding phosphate to BC could provide a better way to apply P to soil in order to obetain better agronomic performances.},

Here we present boron isotope and elemental data for sedimentary pore fluids and isotope data for bulk foraminiferal samples from a deep-sea sediment core. The composition of the pore waters implies that sea water boron concentrations and isotopic composition have been constant during the past 21 Myr, allowing us to reconstruct past ocean pH directly from the foraminiferal isotope data. We find that 21 Myr ago, surface ocean pH was only 7.4 +/- 0.2, but it then increased to 8.2 +/- 0.2 (roughly the present value) about 7.5 Myr ago. This is consistent with suggestions3-5 that atmospheric CO2 concentrations may have been much higher 21 Myr ago than today.},

abstract = {Runoff attenuation features (RAFs) are low-cost, soft-engineered catchment modifications designed to intercept polluted hydrological flow pathways. They are used to slow, store and filter runoff from agricultural land in order to reduce flood risk and improve water quality, specifically by mitigating diffuse water pollution from agriculture. This study focuses on a sub catchment (30ha) of the Belford Burn catchment (5.7km 2) where the capacity of two RAFs to reduce concentrations of suspended sediment (SS), phosphorus (P) and nitrate (NO 3) in runoff has been investigated. A field bund RAF, designed to intercept overland flow during storm events, has been shown to retain significant volumes of sediment; however, the underlying field drains are still exporting high concentrations of sediment and nutrients, sometimes exceeding 500mg SS l -1, 1mg TP l -1 and 40mg NO 3 l -1. An on-line sediment pond is accumulating sediment during normal flow conditions, but event sampling has revealed a lack of retention of any pollutants during storm events, which has been attributed to remobilisation of previously deposited material. In order to address these problems and improve the quality of the water leaving the sub catchment, a novel multi-stage RAF has been constructed in the ditch network. A low-cost filter trap, using wood chippings, has been installed and will be the focus of on-going monitoring and investigations. The ability to help tackle flooding and pollution by managing runoff flow pathways does have great potential, despite being somewhat difficult to evaluate. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {The biological response to extreme temperatures and salinities is investigated in the laboratory for seven species of planktonic foraminifera: Globigerinoides sacculifer (Brady), Globigerinoides ruber (d'Orbigny), Globigerinoides conglobatus (Brady), Globigerinella siphonifera (d'Orbigny), Orbulina universa d'Orbigny, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei (d'Orbigny) and Globorotalia menardii (d'Orbigny). When one of the vital processes, food acceptance, growth or reproduction is inhibited by a culture variable, the absolute survival limit is reached. The measured in vitro temperature ranges compare well with the global temperarure distribution patterns of these species, suggesting that this parameter plays a major role in their biogeographical distribution. The salinity ranges that are tolerated in laboratory cultures exceed the range encontered in modern oceans. Thus salinity does not limit distribution of the species investigated herein. In general, larger mean final shell sizes are attainedand the total shell length increase is larger at optimum temperatures and salinities than at extreme culture condidtions, but the differences were not always statistically significant. Marginal temperature and salinity conditions do not induce contained growth in expatriated specimens. Under extreme culture conditions, the relative frequency of the different shell morphologies is altered relative to normal conditions. "Abnormal" phenotypes are more frequent under normal conditions and the "normal" morphology is found more often under extreme conditions. As opposed to previous reports, the frequency of kummerform chambers generally decreases toward extreme temperature and salinity culture conditions, indicating that kummerform phenotype are not indicative of environmental stress. The incidence of sac-like chambers in G. sacculifer and the formation of spherical chambers in adult O. universa decrease toward extreme temperature and salinity culture conditions, demonstrating that maturation is suppressed in stress situations. SEM investigations show that changes in shell porosity are correlated with treatment variables in culture. The highest porosites are attained at higher temperatures and lower salinities. Generally, an increase in total porosity is achieved by an increase of the pore area accompained by a reduction of the pore density. The in vitro experiments explain the changes that occured in the Pleistocene foraminiferal assemblages from the Red Sea around 18 thousand years ago and earlier. During glacial periods, salinity approximated or even exceeded the uper thresholds that were tolerated under laboratory conditions. Under these circumstances, species disappeared from water column. The order of disappearance as recorded in the sediments may be explained with the upper salinity limits found in this study. Also, the recurrent shifts of dominance between G. sacculifer and G. ruber are well documented for this fossil assemblage. The present experiments support the conclusion that salinity is the driving mechanism behind the phenomenon. Observations in modern oceans suggest that the fertility of the water mass is probably also an important factor behind the shifts of dominance between G. sacculifer and G. ruber.},

abstract = {Fossil Foraminifera appear in the Early Cambrian, at about the same time as the first skeletonized metazoans. However, due to the inadequate preservation of early unilocular (single-chambered) foraminiferal tests and difficulties in their identification, the evolution of early foraminifers is poorly understood. By using molecular data from a wide range of extant naked and testate unilocular species, we demonstrate that a large radiation of nonfossilized unilocular Foraminifera preceded the diversification of multilocular lineages during the Carboniferous. Within this radiation, similar test morphologies and wall types developed several times independently. Our findings indicate that the early Foraminifera were an important component of Neoproterozoic protistan community, whose ecological complexity was probably much higher than has been generally accepted.},

The particles involved in these nonclassical pathways to crystallization are diverse, in contrast to classical models that consider only the addition of monomeric chemical species. We review progress toward understanding crystal growth by particle-attachment processes and show that multiple pathways result from the interplay of free-energy landscapes and reaction dynamics. Much remains unknown about the fundamental aspects, particularly the relationships between solution structure, interfacial forces, and particle motion.

abstract = {This special issue is dedicated to microbialites and microbial communities and addresses their biological diversity, their biogeochemical functioning, their roles in diagenetic processes and their environmental significance. It is the logical successor of the special issue that one of us edited after the workshop on Microbial mediation in carbonate diagenesis which was held in Chichilianne (France) in 1997 (Camoin, G., Ed., 1999. Microbial mediation in carbonate diagenesis. Sedim. Geol., 126, 1334). The following set of papers arose from a multidisciplinary international workshop entitled Microbialites and microbial communities in sedimentary systems: biological diversity, biogeochemical functioning, diagenetic processes, tracers of environmental changes that was held in Paris, France, in September 2004 (G. Camoin and P. Gautret, convenors). This meeting was sponsored by the French Geological Society (Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} G{\'{e}}ologique de France, SGF), the French Association of Sedimentologists (Association des S{\'{e}}dimentologistes Fran{\c{c}}ais, ASF) and the French National Program on Coastal Environments (Programme National Environnement C{\^{o}}tier, PNEC). The goals of this Workshop were: 1) to review the knowledge concerning modern and fossil microbial communities and microbialites that occur in various sedimentary environments (marine realm, thermal springs, lakes, rivers, deserts, karsts etc.), and 2) to establish a prospective regarding the research activities to be developed in various fields concerning the study of microbial communities and microbialites: their biological diversity, their biogeochemical functioning, their implication in the cycles of elements, the diagenetic processes that characterize these structures and the control exerted by environmental and climatic parameters both on their composition and their distribution in time and space. This Workshop has been attended by 70 participants from 11 countries (Belgium, France, Germany, United States, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and United Kingdom) with diverse specialities (sedimentology, geochemistry, biology, biochemistry, oceanography, microbiology) and research interests (from Precambrian to modern environments and from natural settings to laboratory experimentation). 52 talks and several open discussions concerned the following interrelated topics, among many, on microbialites : their biological diversity, their biogeochemical functioning, their growth patterns and development, their environmental significance, and the microbial diagenesis and diagenetic processes in microbialites. The abstracts were assembled in a Special Publication of the Association of French Sedimentologists (Camoin and Gautret, Eds, 2004.

We investigated the diet, age structure, and morphology of a population of crested terns to determine whether survival and growth were reduced for cohorts reared in years immediately following sardine mortality events. The diet of chicks and adults differed significantly. Australian anchovy (Engraulis australis) and sardine were the dominant prey in the diets of chicks, constituting an average of 36.3 and 14.6{\%} of individual prey items, respectively. Degens leatherjacket (Thamnoconus degeni) dominated the prey of adult terns, an average of 51.9{\%} of individual prey items. Age-specific information collected from banded adults indicated that the cohort reared after the first sardine mortality event in 1995 exhibited significantly lower rates of recruitment to the breeding colony than as predicted by life-table analyses, suggesting that survival was reduced in response to the absence of sardine. Females from cohorts reared {\textless}1 year after the end of each sardine mortality event (in 1996 and 1999) were smaller than other age classes, suggesting that chick growth was reduced during periods of low sardine abundance. Future data on diet and on the survival and growth of crested tern chicks could provide performance indicators for management of sardine populations and aid in the development of conservation strategies for the populations of crested tern.},

abstract = {Inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) catalyse the accumulation of CO(2) around rubisco in all cyanobacteria, most algae and aquatic plants and in C(4) and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) vascular plants. CCMs are polyphyletic (more than one evolutionary origin) and involve active transport of HCO(3)(-), CO(2) and/or H(+), or an energized biochemical mechanism as in C(4) and CAM plants. While the CCM in almost all C(4) plants and many CAM plants is constitutive, many CCMs show acclimatory responses to variations in the supply of not only CO(2) but also photosynthetically active radiation, nitrogen, phosphorus and iron. The evolution of CCMs is generally considered in the context of decreased CO(2) availability, with only a secondary role for increasing O(2). However, the earliest CCMs may have evolved in oxygenic cyanobacteria before the atmosphere became oxygenated in stromatolites with diffusion barriers around the cells related to UV screening. This would decrease CO(2) availability to cells and increase the O(2) concentration within them, inhibiting rubisco and generating reactive oxygen species, including O(3).},

abstract = {-Lattice constant and density studies on oxygen free and oxygen doped silicon single crystals suggest that oxygen occupies an interstitial lattice site. IT IS NOW well established that silicon crystals can contain considerable amounts of oxygen as an impurity.(l) The maximum solubility was found to be 1.8{\~{}} 1018 oxygen atoms per cma.@) It was suggested that the oxygen atom occupies an inter-stitial lattice position while being bound to two adjacent silicon atoms.c3) This model received strong support from the work of HROSTOWSKI et d.(4) who studied extensively the infrared absorp-tion spectra of the silicon-oxygen molecular vibrations. The electrical neutrality of oxygen in silicon and the fact that the diffusivity of oxygen in silicon(5) is larger than that of other substi-tutional impurities were in accord with this inter-stitial picture. SMA{\~{}}UJLA et aZ.(s) compared the lattice constant (using a powder technique) of one silicon crystal prepared by the floating zone tech-nique (as = 5.43075 +{\_} 0*00002 A) with the lattice constant of silicon crystals which were pulled from a melt which was contained in a silica crucible (as = 5.43072 + 0.00002 A). These latter crystals are known to contain oxygen in varying concentra-tions. Frequently an impurity content of approxi-mately 101s oxygen atoms per cm3 is found in such crystals. The oxygen contaminated silicon was re-ported to be less dense than the oxygen free material,(s) by several parts in the 6th decimal (g/ems). From the decrease in lattice constant and density of the oxygen rich material the authors draw the conclusion that oxygen occupies a sub-stitutional lattice site in silicon.@) Since the conclusions of SMAKULA are at variance with the conclusions from optical andother physical data, we have reinvestigated the density and, with greater precision, the lattice constant of silicon well defined particularly with respect to its oxygen con-tent. It is essential in these studies that material of high purity be used and that the impurity under consideration is introduced in a known manner. The only impurity known to be present in our material was boron in a concentration of 101s boron atoms per ems.(7) The same silicon was used for the oxygen free and oxygen enriched specimen. A single-crystalline rod of silicon was prepared in a floating zone system in a vacuum of better than 10-s mm Hg pressure. Without removing the crystal from the system several centimeters of the rod were regrown in an ambient of 1 atm of oxygen. In this way the maximum solubility of 1' 8 x 101s oxygen atoms per cm3 is introduced into this part of the crystal.(s) The lattice constant measurements were made on single crystal plates cut from this crystal. A high precision crystal spectrometer was used in which high orders of reflection are observed on both sides of zero. The circle reads to one second. By reading crystal positions instead of reflection directions, errors due to eccentricity and absorption as well as radius error are minimized. This is not the case with powder methods.@) Our results, computed for 25°C and assuming the wavelength of Cu Kal X-rays as 1.54050 A are:},

abstract = {Ostracode shell chemistry is a powerful tool for recording changes of certain dissolved ions in their environment. Such data are commonly interpreted in terms of change in temperature and salinity, which are then used to offer insights into paleohydrology and from that paleoclimate. In particular, the changes in Sr/Ca{\textless}sub{\textgreater}shell{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} are believed to reflect changes in salinity, and the changes in Mg/Ca{\textless}sub{\textgreater}shell{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} to reflect both salinity and water temperature. However, the established application of this proxy too often ignores the complexities involved in the chemical changes accompanying solute evolution, hydrologic change, physical chemistry, and the autoecology and biology of ostracodes. Chemical changes occur: (1) in the dissolved Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios during solute evolution, (2) as a consequence of multiple sources of water, but especially ground and surface water interchange as well as evaporation, (3) as a consequence of different dissolved cation{\^{a}}€“anion pair formation at various concentrations, and (4) because of bio/ecologic effects, including seasonality of molting and taxa-specific ionic regulation capabilities. We suggest that changes in shell chemistry in a stratigraphic sequence tell us when changes occurred in the solutes, but cannot identify what caused those change(s) in the chemical environment. Inclusion of information from other paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic proxies that co-occur with ostracode shells may help to limit the choices amongst possible causes.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: A temporal change in stable isotope ($\delta$15N) distributions in North Sea harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena (L.) was documented by analysing stable isotope abundances in bone collagen from 88 skeletons of harbour porpoises stranded in the period between 1848 and 2002 along the southern North Sea coast. Porpoises collected after {\~{}}1960 had significantly lower $\delta$15N than porpoises collected earlier. This change in $\delta$15N implies that fundamental changes in food web structure in, or nutrient availability to, the North Sea have taken place over the last {\~{}}150 yr and that most of the change occurred over a relatively short period in the middle of the 20th century. Harbour porpoises are generalist feeders and their diet largely reflects the food available to them. Thus, one plausible explanation for the observed change in $\delta$15N could be that harbour porpoises in the North Sea have, since the mid-20th century, been feeding at a lower trophic level than during the preceding century, i.e. animals from lower trophic levels may now be more dominant than they were prior to the middle of the 20th century. There is no a priori reason to suspect that a change in isotope distributions at the base of the food web has occurred during this period and we have not been able to find material that would allow us to test the assumption that there has been no temporal development of $\delta$15N at the lowest levels of the food web. Thus, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the change in $\delta$15N in harbour porpoise skeletons reported here may be a reflection of a change in the isotope signature of nitrogen entering the food web. Regardless of its underlying cause, the recorded change in isotopic signature in harbour porpoises is noteworthy as it represents the first fisheries-independent documentation of a long-term temporal change in the structure or function of the pelagic ecosystem in the North Sea.},

abstract = {The natural composite nacre is characterised by astonishing mechanical properties, although the main constituent is a brittle mineral shaped as tablets interdispersed by organic layers. To mimic the natural formation process which takes place at ambient conditions an understanding of the mechanism responsible for a defined microstructure of nacre is necessary. Since proteins are assumed to be involved in this mechanism, it is advantageous to identify distinct proteins interacting with minerals from the totality of proteins contained in nacre. Here, we adopted and modified a recently published approach given by Suzuki et al. [1] that gives a hint of specific protein-mineral interactions. Synthesised aragonite or calcite microcrystals were incubated with a protein mixture extracted from nacre of Haliotis laevigata. After incubation the mineral phase was dissolved and investigated for attached proteins. The results give a hint of one protein that seems to bind specifically to aragonite and not to calcite. The presented protocol seems to be suitable to detect mineral binding proteins quickly and therefore can point to proteins whose mineral binding capabilities should be investigated further.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of gelatin, agarose and silica hydrogel with and without magnesium in the growth medium, on calcite single crystal growth and aggregate formation. We characterize the hydrogel and the mineral by cryo-SEM, high-resolution SEM and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). We image the pristine hydrogel fabric and the fabric of hydrogel incorporated into the mineral. We visualize the hydrogel-mineral interface and investigate the effect of the hydrogels on calcite micro- and mesostructure in the gel/calcite composits. We compare hydrogel fabrics in biomimetic hybrid composits with proteinaceous matrices and networks in biological carbonate tissues of bivalves, gastropods, brachiopods and corraline red algae. In Mg-free environments, silica gel has very little effect on crystal morphology and arrangement; the gel/calcite composite that forms is a single gradient mesocrystal.

We visualize the hydrogel-mineral interface and investigate the effect of the hydrogels on calcite micro- and mesostructure in the gel/calcite composits. We compare hydrogel fabrics in biomimetic hybrid composits with proteinaceous matrices and networks in biological carbonate tissues of bivalves, gastropods, brachiopods and corraline red algae.

abstract = {Measurements of B/Ca ratios in marine carbonates have been suggested to record seawater carbonate chemistry, however experimental calibration of such proxies based on inorganic partitioning remains limited. Here we conducted a series of synthetic aragonite precipitation experiments to evaluate the factors influencing the partitioning of B/Ca between aragonite and seawater. Our results indicate that the B/Ca ratio of synthetic aragonites depends primarily on the relative concentrations of borate and carbonate ions in the solution from which the aragonite precipitates; not on bicarbonate concentration as has been previously suggested. The influence of temperature was not significant over the range investigated (20-40 ??C), however, partitioning may be influenced by saturation state (and/or growth rate). Based on our experimental results, we suggest that aragonite B/Ca ratios can be utilized as a proxy of [CO32-]. Boron isotopic composition (??11B) is an established pH proxy, thus B/Ca and ??11B together allow the full carbonate chemistry of the solution from which the aragonite precipitated to be calculated. To the extent that aragonite precipitation by marine organisms is affected by seawater chemistry, B/Ca may also prove useful in reconstructing seawater chemistry. A simplified boron purification protocol based on amberlite resin and the organic buffer TRIS is also described.},

abstract = {Li/Ca and Li isotope ratios in marine and freshwater calcium carbonates are potential tracers of past environmental variables such as weathering intensity and temperature. To make use of their potential requires full understanding of the fractionation of Li/Ca and 7Li/6Li during growth of calcium carbonate. This study improves such understanding with two sets of new measurements: on inorganic calcites and aragonites precipitated over a range of salinity and on the test of benthic foraminifera formed at a range of temperatures. Li/Ca in inorganic calcite increases by a factor of four as salinity increases from 10‰ to 50‰. Inorganic aragonite demonstrates no significant change in Li/Ca over the same salinity range. The difference in behaviour is probably due to the incorporation mechanism of Li. Substitution of Li+ in the Ca2+ site in aragonite makes growth-solution Li/Ca the key variable, while interstitial incorporation of Li+ in calcite means that the growth-solution Li concentration is more important. Compared to the growth solution, 7Li/6Li is ≈ 3‰ lower in calcite and ≈ 11‰ lower in aragonite, with no relationship to salinity for either mineral. Similar isotope fractionation to these inorganic experiments are observed for biogenically produced calcite (foraminifera) and aragonite (corals). This suggests little biological control during Li incorporation into biogenic calcium carbonates. The difference in fractionation between calcite and aragonite is consistent with an equilibrium isotope fractionation reflecting different incorporation mechanisms for Li into the two minerals. Four samples of the benthic foraminifera Uvigerina, precipitated over a temperature range of 14 °C, have Li/Ca ranging from 18.5 to 13.1 $\mu$mol/mol. The ratio is inversely related to temperature with a sensitivity of 2.5±0.8{\%} per °C. This sensitivity is similar to that observed in a previous study of foraminiferal Li/Ca, but about half that observed during inorganic calcite growth. The large variability in both Li/Ca and temperature sensitivity exhibited between various foraminifera species suggests an additional control on calcite Li/Ca apart from those of salinity and temperature observed in this study. {\textcopyright} Elsevier B.V.

Transition of ACC to calcite in whole larvae and isolated spicules during development has been monitored using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Remarkably, the changing nature of the mineral phase can clearly be monitored in the whole embryo samples. More detailed analyses of isolated spicules at different stages of development using both XAS and infrared spectroscopy demonstrate that the short-range order of the transient ACC phase resembles calcite, even though infrared spectra show that the spicules are mostly composed of an amorphous mineral phase. The coordination sphere is at first distorted but soon adopts the octahedral symmetry typical of calcite. Long-range lattice rearrangement follows to form the calcite single crystal of the mature spicule. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of real-time monitoring of mineralized-tissue development using,XAS, including the structural characterization of transient amorphous phases at the atomic level.},

Previous studies show that an increase in ventilation of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) caused a 30–60{\%} decrease in labile nutrients within the thermocline layer. Using foraminiferal Ba/Ca as a proxy of refractory nutrients, increased ventilation during the LGM produced a depletion of less than 20{\%} compared to Holocene values. Following glaciation, the production of Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW) shut down owing to the presence of meltwater in the surface ocean, which resulted in a decrease in ventilation, as seen by an enrichment of barium in the basal thermocline. GNAIW was subsequently replaced by barium-rich southern component water in the middepth western North Atlantic. Foraminiferal Ba/Ca data suggest a 38{\%} contribution from southern component water to a depth as shallow as 1475 m and a 14{\%} contribution at 1123 m during deglaciation.},

This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study.

abstract = {Particle fluxes measured with time series sediment traps deployed below 2000 m at 68 sites in the world ocean are combined with satellite-derived estimates of export production from the overlying water to assess the factors affecting the transfer of particulate organic matter from surface to deep water. Multiple linear regression is used to derive an algorithm suggesting that the transfer efficiency of organic carbon, defined as the settling flux of organic carbon normalized to export production, increases with the flux of carbonate and decreases with water depth and seasonality. The algorithm predicts {\textgreater}80{\%} of the organic carbon transfer efficiency variability in diverse oceanic regions. The influence of the carbonate flux suggests that the ballasting effect of this biogenic mineral may be an important factor promoting export of organic carbon to the deep sea by increasing the density of settling particles. However, the lack of a similar effect for biogenic opal suggests that factors other than particle density also play a role. The adverse effect of increasing seasonality on the transfer efficiency of carbon to the deep sea is tentatively attributed to greater biodegradability of organic matter exported during bloom events. In high latitude opal-dominated regions with high f-ratios and seasonality, while a higher fraction of net production is exported, a higher fraction of the exported organic matter is remineralized before reaching bathypelagic depths. On the other hand, in warm, low latitude, carbonate-dominated regions with low f-ratios and seasonality, a higher fraction of the exported organic matter sinks to the deep sea.},

abstract = {The desmid green alga Closterium moniliferum belongs to a small number of organisms that form barite (BaSO 4) or celestite (SrSO 4) biominerals. The ability to sequester Sr in the presence of an excess of Ca is of considerable interest for the remediation of 90Sr from the environment and nuclear waste. While most cells dynamically regulate the concentration of the second messenger Ca 2+ in the cytosol and various organelles, transport proteins rarely discriminate strongly between Ca, Sr, and Ba. Herein, we investigate how these ions are trafficked in C. moniliferum and how precipitation of (Ba,Sr)SO 4 crystals occurs in the terminal vacuoles. Towards this goal, we simultaneously visualize intracellular dynamics of multiple elements using X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) of cryo-fixed/freeze-dried samples. We correlate the resulting elemental maps with ultrastructural information gleaned from freeze-fracture cryo-SEM of frozen-hydrated cells and use micro X-ray absorption near edge structure (micro-XANES) to determine sulfur speciation. We find that the kinetics of Sr uptake and efflux depend on external Ca concentrations, and Sr, Ba, and Ca show similar intracellular localization. A highly ion-selective cross-membrane transport step is not evident. Based on elevated levels of sulfate detected in the terminal vacuoles, we propose a "sulfate trap" model, where the presence of dissolved barium leads to preferential precipitation of (Ba,Sr)SO 4 due to its low solubility relative to SrSO 4 and CaSO 4. Engineering the sulfate concentration in the vacuole may thus be the most direct way to increase the Sr sequestered per cell, an important consideration in using desmids for phytoremediation of 90Sr. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Overall, the species encompassed a narrow range in delta(13)C values (1.7 per thousand), indicating that they lived in closely related and overlapping habitats. delta(13)C values can be interpreted in terms of distribution with the more (13)C-depleted species (e.g. Stigmatoteuthis arcturi, Vampyroteuthis infernalis) having a more pelagic habitat than the more (13)C-enriched, bathyal species (e.g. Todarodes sagittatus and the giant squid Architeuthis dux). The cephalopods sampled had delta(15)N values ranging 4.6 per thousand, which is consistent with the species spanning approximately 1.5 trophic levels. Neither the giant octopod (Haliphron atlanticus) nor the giant squid reached the highest trophic position. Species delta(15)N was independent of body size, with large squids having both the highest (Taningia danae) and lowest (Lepidoteuthis grimaldii) delta(15)N values.

However, this factor has hitherto not been determined experimentally and a theoretically calculated value (Kakihana and Kotaka, 1977, hereafter KK77) has therefore been widely used. I examine the calculations underlying this value. Using the same spectroscopic data and methods as KK77, I calculate the same ??(B3-B4) = 1.0193 at 300 K. Unfortunately, it turns out that in general the result is sensitive to the experimentally determined vibrational frequencies and the theoretical methods used to calculate the molecular forces. Using analytical techniques and ab initio molecular orbital theory, the outcome for ??(B3-B4) varies between ???1.020 and ???1.050 at 300 K. However, several arguments suggest that ??(B3-B4) ??? 1.030. Measured isotopic shifts in various 10B-, 2D-, and 18O-labeled isotopomers do not provide a constraint on stable boron isotope fractionation. I conclude that in order to anchor the fundamentals of the boron pH proxy, experimental work is required. The critics of the boron pH proxy should note, however, that uncertainties in ??(B3-B4) do not bias pH reconstructions provided that organism-specific calibrations are used.

abstract = {1 We compiled and standardized sediment trap data below 1000 m depth from 52 locations around the globe to infer the implications of the Armstrong et al. 2002 "ballast'' model to the ratio of organic carbon to calcium carbonate in the deep sea (the rain ratio). We distinguished three forms of mineral ballast: calcium carbonate, opal, and lithogenic material. We concur with Armstrong et al. 2002 that organic carbon sinking fluxes correlate tightly with mineral fluxes. Based on the correlations seen in the trap data, we conclude that most of the organic carbon rain in the deep sea is carried by calcium carbonate, because it is denser than opal and more abundant than terrigenous material. This analysis explains the constancy of the organic carbon to calcium carbonate rain ratio in the deep sea today, and argues against large changes in the mean value of this ratio in the past. However, sediment trap data show variability in the ratio in areas of high relative calcium carbonate export (mass CaCO3/mass ratio {\textgreater} 0.4), unexplainable by the model, leaving open the possibility of regional variations in the rain ratio in the past.},

abstract = {Mg-bearing calcite was precipitated at 25??C in closed system free-drift experiments from solutions containing NaHCO3, CaCl2 and MgCl2. The chemical and isotope composition of the solution and precipitate were investigated during time course experiments of 24-h duration. Monohydrocalcite and calcite precipitated early in the experiments ({\textless}8 h), while Mg-calcite was the predominant precipitate ({\textgreater}95{\%}) thereafter. Solid collected at the end of the experiments displayed compositional zoning from pure calcite in crystal cores to up to 23 mol{\%} MgCO3 in the rims. Smaller excursions in Mg were superimposed on this chemical record, which is characteristic of oscillatory zoning observed in synthetic and natural solid-solution carbonates of differing solubility. Magnesium also altered the predominant morphology of crystals over time from the {\{}104{\}} to {\{}100{\}} and {\{}110{\}} growth forms. The oxygen isotope fractionation factor for the magnesian-calcite-water system (as 103ln??Mg-cl-H2O) displayed a strong dependence on the mol{\%} MgCO3 in the solid phase, but quantification of the relationship was difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of the precipitate. Considering only the Mg-content and ??18O values for the bulk solid, 103ln??Mg-cl-H2O increased at a rate of 0.17 ?? 0.02 per mol{\%} MgCO3; this value is a factor of three higher than the single previous estimate (Tarutani T., Clayton R.N., and Mayeda T. K. (1969) The effect of polymorphims and magnesium substitution on oxygen isotope fractionation between calcium carbonate and water. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 33, 987-996). Nevertheless, extrapolation of our relationship to the pure calcite end member yielded a value of 27.9 ?? 0.02, which is similar in magnitude to published values for the calcite-water system. Although no kinetic effect as observed on 103ln??Mg-cl-H2O for precipitation rates that ranged from 103.21 to 104.60 ??mol ?? m-2 ?? h-1, it was impossible to disentangle the potential effect(s) of precipitation rate and Mg-content on 103ln??Mg-cl-H2O due to the heterogeneous nature of the solid. The results of this study suggest that paleotemperatures inferred from the ??18O values of high magnesian calcite ({\textgreater}10 mol{\%} MgCO3) may be significantly underestimated. Also, the results underscore the need for additional experiments to accurately characterize the effect of Mg coprecipitation on the isotope systematics of calcite from a chemically homogeneous precipitate or a heterogeneous material that is analyzed at the scale of chemical and isotopic zonation.

abstract = {This paper focuses on the ecosystem regime shift in the North Sea that occurred during the period 1982-1988. The evidence for the change is seen from individual species to key ecosystem parameters such as diversity and from phytoplankton to fish. Although many biological/ecosystem parameters and individual species exhibited a stepwise change during the period 1983-1988, some indicators show no evidence of change. The cause of the regime shift is likely to be related to pronounced changes in large-scale hydro-meteorological forcing. This involved activating of complex intermediate physical mechanisms which explains why the exact timing of the shift can vary from 1982 to 1988 (centred around two periods: 1982-1985 and 1987-1988) according to the species or taxonomic group. Increased sea surface temperature and possibly change in wind intensity and direction at the end of the 1970s in the west European basin triggered a change in the location of an oceanic biogeographical boundary along the European continental shelf. This affected both the stable and substrate biotope components of North Sea marine ecosystems (i.e. components related to the water masses and components which are geographically stable) circa 1984. Large-scale hydro-climatic forcing also modified local hydro-meteorological parameters around the North Sea after 1987 affecting the stable biotope components of North Sea ecosystems. Problems related to the detection and quantification of an ecosystem regime shift are discussed. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Water and sediment samples were collected from the headwaters (the Tuotuo River and Chumaer River) of the Yangtze River, Tongtian River and Jinsha River (HTJR) originating from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Sr and 87Sr/86Sr have been measured to analyze temporal and spatial variation characteristics and determine relative contributions from atmospheric inputs, anthropogenic activities and rock weathering. These results show that Sr in the HTJR waters ranges from 1.37 to 11.07????mol L- 1, and 87Sr/86Sr from 0.70948 to 0.71409. The headwaters Tuotuo River and Chumaer River receive {\~{}} 95{\%} of their Sr from evaporite dissolution. The influence of evaporite decreases gradually downwards from source area as increase in discharge. Silicate weathering contributes 4.9{\%}-28.2{\%} of dissolved Sr to the Jinsha River mainstream and 11.5{\%}-42.4{\%} to the tributaries. 87Sr/86Sr ranges from 0.71034 to 0.71177 in the Jinsha River mainstream, which is higher than those in other reaches of the Yangtze River. In the Jinsha River suture belt, granitoids and metamorphic rocks with relatively high 87Sr/86Sr are exposed. Moreover, carbonate weathering is another important source of Sr in the Jinsha River waters. It is estimated that 15.9{\%}-46.8{\%} of Sr in the mainstream and 37{\%}-64.5{\%} of Sr in the tributaries are derived from carbonate weathering. Contribution from atmospheric precipitation to the Sr in the HTJR is from 0.75{\%} to 6.1{\%} and influence of anthropogenic activities is slight. The 87Srex flux forcing changes in seawater Sr isotopic composition is 1.13 ?? 106??mol a- 1 for the HTJR at Yibin, being far lower than those in the Ganges and Brahmaputra and merely accounting for 1.36{\%} of the total carried by the global rivers. Therefore, impact of the HTJR on steady increase of seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratio since 40??Ma may be very small. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In recent years it has become apparent that the “cool tropic paradox” of Paleogene and Cretaceous “greenhouse” climates arises because of the diagenetic alteration of tropical planktic foraminiferal calcite near the seafloor, yielding artificially high $\delta$ 18O values. Because the Mg/Ca compositions of foraminiferal and inorganic calcite are thought to be quite different, Mg/Ca measurements should be a sensitive way of monitoring diagenetic alteration. Here we examine the extent of diagenetic alteration of Eocene planktic foraminiferal calcite using scanning electron microscope imaging of foraminiferal test microstructures and geochemical ($\delta$ 18O and Mg/Ca) analyses. We compare microstructural and geochemical characteristics between given species exhibiting two contrasting states of preservation: those that appear “frosty” under reflected light and those that appear “glassy.” Microstructural evidence reveals extensive diagenetic alteration of frosty foraminiferal tests at the micron scale, while $\delta$ 18O analyses document consistently higher $\delta$ 18O (and therefore lower paleotemperatures) in this material. Yet we find that $\delta$ 18O offsets between species in these frosty foraminiferal assemblages appear to be generally preserved, suggesting that frosty foraminifera remain valuable for generating relatively short (approximately ≤1 Myr) paleoceanographic time series that do not demand absolute estimates of paleotemperature. We also find that the observed increase in Mg/Ca for planktic foraminifera exhibiting diagenetic alteration (compared to glassy taphonomies) is far smaller than would be expected from the addition of inorganic calcite based on laboratory-derived Mg2+ partition coefficients. Our findings imply that a much lower Mg2+ partition coefficient controls inorganic calcite formation in deep sea sedimentary sections, in accordance with the findings of Baker et al. (1982).},

The four-by-three factorial design consisted of four circulating temperature baths (7, 11, 15 and 19°C), and three salinity ranges (23, 28, and 32). During the experiment, water Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca molar ratios were monitored weekly, and showed little variation across all salinity and temperature ranges. Data from sampled shells including all salinity treatments yielded relatively poor relationships between shell elemental chemistry and water temperatures. However, if only the low salinity treatment data (23) are used, the relationships between shell elemental chemistry and water temperature improve moderately. Based on the data presented here, it may be possible to use Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios from the shell carbonate of juvenile M. edulis to reconstruct paleotemperatures in estuarine settings (salinity below 24) with a corresponding RMSE (root mean squared error; 95{\%} confidence interval) of ±2.4°C and ±2.8°C, respectively. In order for this methodology to be statistically meaningful, water temperature changes must be rather large, as the errors associated with using Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios from the shell material of M. edulis are substantial. Further work is required to determine if the findings presented here can be duplicated, and if the potential salinity effect is pervasive.},

abstract = {The impact of CO2-acidified seawater (pH 7.8, 7.6, or 6.5, control = pH 8) on the health of Mytilus edulis was investigated during a 60 d mesocosm experiment. Mussel health was determined using the neutral red retention (NRR) assay for lysosomal membrane stability and from histopathological analysis of reproductive, digestive and respiratory tissues. Seawater acidification was shown to significantly reduce mussel health as measured by the NRR assay, and it is suggested that this impact is due to elevated levels of calcium ions (Ca2+) in the haemolymph, generated by the dissolution of the mussels' calcium carbonate shells. No impact on tissue structures was observed, and it is concluded that M. edulis possess strong physiological mechanisms by which they are able to protect body tissues against short-term exposure to highly acidified seawater. However, these mechanisms come at an energetic cost, which can result in reduced growth during long-term exposures. Consequently, the predicted long-term changes to seawater chemistry associated with ocean acidification are likely to have a more significant effect on the health and survival of M. edulis populations than the short-lived effects envisaged from CO, leakage from sub-seabed storage. Ocean acidification could reduce the general health status of this commercially and ecologically important marine species.},

abstract = {Boron isotopic and elemental systematics are used to define the vital effects for the temperate shallow water Mediterranean coral Cladocora caespitosa. The corals are from a range of seawater pH conditions (pHT {\~{}}7.6 to {\~{}}8.1) and environmental settings: (1) naturally living colonies harvested from normal pH waters offshore Levanto, (2) colonies transplanted nearby a subsea volcanic vent system, and (3) corals cultured in aquaria exposed to high (700$\mu$atm) and near present day (400$\mu$atm) pCO2 levels. B/Ca compositions measured using laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) show that boron uptake by C. caespitosa cultured at different pCO2 levels is independent of ambient seawater pH being mainly controlled by temperature-dependent calcification. In contrast, the boron isotope compositions ($\delta$11Bcarb) of the full suite of corals determined by positive thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (PTIMS) shows a clear trend of decreasing $\delta$11Bcarb (from 26.7 to 22.2‰) with decreasing seawater pH, reflecting the strong pH dependence of the boron isotope system. The $\delta$11Bcarb compositions together with measurements of ambient seawater parameters enable calibration of the boron pH proxy for C. caespitosa, by using a new approach that defines the relationship between ambient seawater pH (pHsw) and the internally controlled pH at the site of calcification (pHbiol). C. caespitosa exhibits a linear relationship between pHsw and the shift in pH due to physiological processes ($\delta$pH=pHbiol-pHsw) giving the regression $\delta$pHClad=4.80-0.52×pHsw for this species. We further apply this method ("$\delta$pH-pHsw") to calibrate tropical species of Porites, Acropora, and Stylophora reported in the literature. The temperate and tropical species calibrations are all linearly correlated (r2{\textgreater}0.9) and the biological fractionation component ($\delta$pH) between species varies within {\~{}}0.2 pH units. Our "$\delta$pH-pHsw" approach provides a robust and accurate tool to reconstruct palaeoseawater pHsw for both temperate and tropical corals, further validating the boron fractionation factor ($\alpha$B3-B4=1.0272) determined experimentally by Klochko et al.

abstract = {In marine elasmobranch fish the consequences for CO2 and acid-base state of moving into low salinity water are not well described. Sub-adult Port Jackson sharks, Heterodontus portusjacksoni, occasionally enter brackish water and survive in 50{\%} seawater (SW). The unidirectional Na efflux and content, plasma volume, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), body mass, as well as CO2 and acid-base state in H. portusjacksoni were investigated following transfer from 100{\%} SW to 75{\%} SW and then to 50{\%} SW. A rapid water influx resulted in a doubling of the plasma volume within 24 h in sharks in 75{\%} SW and an 11{\%} increase in body weight. Osmotic water influx was only partially offset by a doubling of the GFR. There was a approximately 40{\%} decrease in plasma [Na] through a transiently elevated Na clearance and haemodilution. The result was a decrease in the inward gradient for Na+ together with reductions of nearly 50{\%} in CO2 and buffer capacity. The sharks remained hypo-natric to 50{\%} SW by partially conforming to the decrease in external osmotic pressure and avoided the need for active Na+ uptake. The gradient for Na+ efflux would by extrapolation approach zero at approximately 27{\%} SW which may of itself prove a lethal internal dilution. In sharks transferred to 75{\%} SW, a small transient hypercapnia and a later temporary metabolic alkalosis were all largely explained through anaemia promoting loss of CO2 and buffer capacity. In sharks transferred to 50{\%} SW the metabolic alkalosis persisted until the end of the 1-week trial. Within the erythrocytes, increased pH was consequent on the large decrease in haemoglobin content exhibited by the sharks, which caused a large reduction in intracellular buffer. In water as dilute as 50{\%} SW there was no evidence of specific effects on the mechanisms of management of CO2 or H+ excretion but rather significant and indirect effects of the severe haemodilution.},

In FW, bull sharks were hyper-osmotic regulators, having a plasma osmolarity of 595 mOsm l(-1) kg(-1). In SW, bull sharks had significantly higher plasma osmolarities (940 mOsm l(-1) kg(-1)) than FW-acclimated animals and were slightly hypo-osmotic to the environment. Plasma Na(+), Cl(-), K(+), Mg(2+), Ca(2+), urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) concentrations were all significantly higher in bull sharks acclimated to SW, with urea and TMAO showing the greatest increase. Gill, rectal gland, kidney and intestinal tissue were taken from animals acclimated to FW and SW and analysed for maximal Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity. Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in the gills and intestine was less than 1 mmol Pi mg(-1) protein h(-1) and there was no difference in activity between FW- and SW-acclimated animals. In contrast Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in the rectal gland and kidney were significantly higher than gill and intestine and showed significant differences between the FW- and SW-acclimated groups. In FW and SW, rectal gland Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity was 5.6+/-0.8 and 9.2+/-0.6 mmol Pi mg(-1) protein h(-1), respectively. Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in the kidney of FW and SW acclimated animals was 8.4+/-1.1 and 3.3+/-1.1 Pi mg(-1) protein h(-1), respectively. Thus juvenile bull sharks have the osmoregulatory plasticity to acclimate to SW; their preference for the upper reaches of rivers where salinity is low is therefore likely to be for predator avoidance and/or increased food abundance rather than because of a physiological constraint.},

abstract = {The biogeochemical properties of an extensive bloom (approximately 250,000 km2) of the coccolithophore, Emiliania huxleyi, in the north east Atlantic Ocean were investigated in June 1991. Satellite (NOAA-AVHRR) imagery showed that the bloom was centered initially at 60-degrees-63-degrees-N by 13-degrees-28-degrees-W and lasted approximately 3 weeks. Spatial variations in satellite-measured reflectance were well correlated with surface measurements of the beam attenuation coefficient, levels of particulate inorganic carbon, and coccolith density. Rates of both photosynthesis and calcification were typically relatively low within the coccolithophore-rich waters, suggesting the population was in a late stage of development at the time of the field observations. Levels of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) in surface waters were high compared to average ocean values, with the greatest concentrations in localized areas characterized by relatively high rates of photosynthesis, calcification, and grazing by microzooplankton. The estimated spatially averaged flux of DMS to the atmosphere was 1122 nmol m-2 h-1, somewhat greater than that determined for the same region in June-July 1987. Coccolith production (1 x 10(6) tonnes calcite-C) had a significant impact on the state of the CO2 system, causing relative increases of up to 50 muatm in surface pCO2 in association with alkalinity and water temperature changes. Gradients in pCO2 were as great as 100 muatm over horizontal distances of 20-40 km. The environmental implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the spatial and temporal distributions of E. huxleyi},

abstract = {Genetic engineering offers a means of incorporating new virus resistance traits into existing desirable plant cultivars. The initial attempts to create transgenes conferring virus resistance were based on the pathogen-derived resistance concept. The expression of the viral coat protein gene in transgenic plants was shown to induce protective effects similar to classical cross protection, and was therefore distinguished as 'coat-protein-mediated' protection. Since then, a large variety of viral sequences encoding structural and non-structural proteins were shown to confer resistance. Subsequently, non-coding viral RNA was shown to be a potential trigger for virus resistance in transgenic plants, which led to the discovery of a novel innate resistance in plants, RNA silencing. Apart from the majority of pathogen-derived resistance strategies, alternative strategies involving virus-specific antibodies have been successfully applied. In a separate section, efforts to combat viroids in transgenic plants are highlighted. In a final summarizing section, the potential risks involved in the introduction of transgenic crops and the specifics of the approaches used will be discussed.},

abstract = {At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), about 21,000 years before present, land-based ice sheets held enough water to reduce global mean sea level by 130 metres. Yet after decades of study, major uncertainties remain as to the distribution of that ice. Here we test four reconstructions of North American deglacial ice-sheet history by quantitatively connecting them to high-resolution oxygen isotope ($\delta$(18)O) records from the Gulf of Mexico using a water mixing model. For each reconstruction, we route meltwater and seasonal runoff through the time-evolving Mississippi drainage basin, which co-evolves with ice geometry and changing topography as ice loads deform the solid Earth and produce spatially variable sea level in a process known as glacial isostatic adjustment. The $\delta$(18)O records show that the Mississippi-drained southern Laurentide ice sheet contributed only 5.4 ± 2.1 metres to global sea level rise, of which 0.66 ± 0.07 metres were released during the meltwater pulse 1A event 14,650-14,310 years before present, far less water than previously thought. In contrast, the three reconstructions based on glacial isostatic adjustment overpredict the $\delta$(18)O-based post-LGM meltwater volume by a factor of 1.6 to 3.6. The fourth reconstruction, which is based on ice physics, has a low enough Mississippi-routed meltwater discharge to be consistent with $\delta$(18)O constraints, but also contains the largest LGM North American ice volume. This suggests that modelling based on ice physics may be the best way of matching isotopic records while also sequestering enough water in the North American ice sheets to match the observed LGM sea level fall.},

The concentration difference between the two adjacent terraces may lead to a strong reduction in the step velocity, v. A still more important effect of mobile adsorbed impurity is a complicated nonlinear dependence of v on the solution supersaturation, $\sigma$. The kinetic curve, v($\sigma$), is determined by the mechanism which controls the lifetime of piled up impurity: either desorption, or incorporation into the growing layer, or migration to the back terrace over the step riser. At low $\sigma$, the mobile impurity particles should be considered as a 2D gas; at higher $\sigma$, one should treat each particle as an individual obstacle for a moving step. These two approaches, although qualitatively different, lead to identical expressions for v($\sigma$). {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Measurements of Sr/Ca of benthic foraminifera show a linear decrease with water depth which is superimposed upon significant variability identified by analyses of individual foraminifera. New data for Cd/Ca support previous work in defining a contrast between waters shallower and deeper than similar to 2500 m. Measured element partition coefficients in foraminiferal calcium carbonate relative to sea water (D) have been described by means of a one-box model in which elements are extracted by Rayleigh distillation from a biomineralization reservoir that serves for calcification with a constant fractionation factor (alpha), such that D = (1 - f(alpha))/(1 - f), where f is the proportion of Ca remaining after precipitation. A modification to the model recognises differences in element speciation. The model is consistent with differences between D-Sr, D-Ba and D-Cd in benthic but not planktonic foraminifera. Depth variations in D for Sr and Ba are consistent with the model, as are differences in depth variation of D, in calcitic and aragonitic benthic foraminifera. The shallower depth variations may reflect increasing calcification rates with increasing water depth to an optimum of about 2500 m. Observations of unusually lower D-Cd for some deep waters, not accompanied by similar D-Sr or D-Ba, may be because of dissolution or a calcification response to a lower carbonate saturation state.},

abstract = {Insight into the response of reef corals and other major marine calcifiers to ocean acidification is limited by a lack of knowledge about how seawater pH and carbonate chemistry impact the physiological processes that drive biomineralization. Ocean acidification is proposed to reduce calcification rates in corals by causing declines in internal pH at the calcifying tissue-skeleton interface where biomineralization takes place. Here, we performed an in vivo study on how partial-pressure CO(2)-driven seawater acidification impacts intracellular pH in coral calcifying cells and extracellular pH in the fluid at the tissue-skeleton interface [subcalicoblastic medium (SCM)] in the coral Stylophora pistillata. We also measured calcification in corals grown under the same conditions of seawater acidification by measuring lateral growth of colonies and growth of aragonite crystals under the calcifying tissue. Our findings confirm that seawater acidification decreases pH of the SCM, but this decrease is gradual relative to the surrounding seawater, leading to an increasing pH gradient between the SCM and seawater. Reductions in calcification rate, both at the level of crystals and whole colonies, were only observed in our lowest pH treatment when pH was significantly depressed in the calcifying cells in addition to the SCM. Overall, our findings suggest that reef corals may mitigate the effects of seawater acidification by regulating pH in the SCM, but they also highlight the role of calcifying cell pH homeostasis in determining the response of reef corals to changes in external seawater pH and carbonate chemistry.},

abstract = {We have located warm springs on an isolated basement outcrop on 3.5 Ma crust on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the northeast Pacific Ocean. These are the first ridge-flank hydrothermal springs discovered on crust older than 1 Ma. The springs are venting altered seawater at 25.0 °C along a fault near the summit of Baby Bare outcrop, a high point along a ridge-axis-parallel basement ridge that is otherwise buried by turbidite sediment. Baby Bare is a small volcano that probably erupted off-axis ca. 1.7 Ma; it is thermally extinct, but acts as a high-permeability conduit for venting of basement fluids. The springs have been sampled from the manned submersible Alvin. Compared with the ambient ocean bottom water, they are heavily depleted in Mg, alkalinity, CO2, sulfate, K, Li, U, O2, nitrate, and phosphate, and enriched in Ca, chlorinity, ammonia, Fe, Mn, H2S, H2, CH4, 222Rn, and 226Ra. The springs appear to support a community of thysirid clams. Although we saw no obvious bacterial mats, the surficial sediments contain the highest biomass concentrations ever measured in the deep sea, based on their phospholipid phosphate content. Areal integration of Alvin heat-flow and pore-water velocity data yields flux estimates of 4–13 L/s and 2–3 MW for the total (diffuse and focused) hydrothermal output from Baby Bare, comparable to that from a black smoker vent on the ridge axis. Warm springs such as those on Baby Bare may be important for global geochemical fluxes.},

abstract = {Interpretation of carbon isotope records from late Quaternary planktonic foraminifers are confounded due to the presence of a significant physiological component in the carbon isotopic signal. A quantitative carbon isotope (QC) model is presented which relates the carbon isotopic composition of a foraminiferal shell to the physiological processes of respiration and symbiont photosynthesis and to the $\delta$13C value of seawater $\Sigma$CO2. The QC model is calibrated with physiological and stable isotopic data from laboratory experiments with living planktonic foraminifers. Model simulations of chamber and shell $\delta$13C values with the symbiont-bearing foraminifers, Orbulina universa and Globigerinoides sacculifer, suggest (1) variations in symbiont density and photosynthetic rate (light level or habitat depth) are the primary physiological parameters controlling intraspecific carbon isotopic variability in these species, (2) respiration has little effect on the $\delta$13C of O. universa, and (3) each chamber in a multichambered foraminiferal test will have a distinct $\delta$13C value depending on its position in the test whorl. Size:$\delta$13C value relationships reported for G. sacculifer from fossil assemblages can be explained as a function of increasing symbiont density during ontogenetic development.},

abstract = {Abstract: Recent episodes of coral bleaching have led to wide-scale loss of reef corals and raised concerns over the effectiveness of existing conservation and management efforts. The 1998 bleaching event was most severe in the western Indian Ocean, where coral declined by up to 90{\%} in some locations. Using fisheries-independent data, we assessed the long-term impacts of this event on fishery target species in the Seychelles, the overall size structure of the fish assemblage, and the effectiveness of two marine protected areas (MPAs) in protecting fish communities. The biomass of fished species above the size retained in fish traps changed little between 1994 and 2005, indicating no current effect on fishery yields. Biomass remained higher in MPAs, indicating they were effective in protecting fish stocks. Nevertheless, the size structure of the fish communities, as described with size-spectra analysis, changed in both fished areas and MPAs, with a decline in smaller fish ({\textless}30 cm) and an increase in larger fish ({\textgreater}45 cm). We believe this represents a time-lag response to a reduction in reef structural complexity brought about because fishes are being lost through natural mortality and fishing, and are not being replaced by juveniles. This effect is expected to be greater in terms of fisheries productivity and, because congruent patterns are observed for herbivores, suggests that MPAs do not offer coral reefs long-term resilience to bleaching events. Corallivores and planktivores declined strikingly in abundance, particularly in MPAs, and this decline was associated with a similar pattern of decline in their preferred corals. We suggest that climate-mediated disturbances, such as coral bleaching, be at the fore of conservation planning for coral reefs.},

abstract = {Prokaryotes in marine sediments taken from two neighboring semienclosed bays (the Yamada and Kamaishi bays) at the Sanriku coast in Japan were investigated by the culture-independent molecular phylogenetic approach coupled with chemical and activity analyses. These two bays were chosen in terms of their similar hydrogeological and chemical characteristics but different usage modes; the Yamada bay has been used for intensive shellfish aquaculture, while the Kamaishi bay has a commercial port and is not used for aquaculture. Substantial differences were found in the phylogenetic composition of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries con- structed for the Yamada and Kamaishi sediments. In the Yamada library, phylotypes affiliated with ?-Pro- teobacteria were the most abundant, and those affiliated with ?-Proteobacteria were the second-most abundant. In contrast, the Kamaishi library was occupied by phylotypes affiliated with Planctomycetes, ?-Proteobacteria, ?-Proteobacteria, and Crenarchaeota.Inthe ?-Proteobacteria, many Yamada phylotypes were related to free- living and symbiotic sulfur oxidizers, whereas the Kamaishi phylotype was related to the genus Pseudomonas. These results allowed us to hypothesize that sulfate-reducing and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria have become abundant in the Yamada sediment. This hypothesis was supported by quantitative competitive PCR (qcPCR) with group-specific primers. The qcPCR also suggested that organisms closely related to Desulfotalea in the Desulfobulbaceae were the major sulfate-reducing bacteria in these sediments. In addition, potential sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation rates in the sediment samples were determined, indicating that the sulfur cycle has become active in the Yamada sediment beneath the areas of intensive shellfish aquaculture.

abstract = {We have investigated the nanotexture and crystallographic orientation of aragonite in a coral skeleton using synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Polarization-dependent STXM imaging at 40-nm spatial resolution was used to obtain an orientation map of the c-axis of aragonite on a focused ion beam milled ultrathin section of a Porites coral. This imaging showed that one of the basic units of coral skeletons, referred to as the center of calcification (COC), consists of a cluster of 100-nm aragonite globules crystallographically aligned over several micrometers with a fan-like distribution and with the properties of single crystals at the mesoscale. The remainder of the skeleton consists of aragonite single-crystal fibers in crystallographic continuity with the nanoglobules comprising the COC. Our observation provides information on the nm-scale processes that led to biomineral formation in this sample. Importantly, the present study illustrates how the methodology described here, which combines HRTEM and polarization-dependent synchrotron-based STXM imaging, offers an interesting new approach for investigating biomineralizing systems at the nm-scale. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The concentrations of a number of trace metals (Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, Cd and Hg) have been determined in sediments from cores collected in the Southampton Water region. Measurements of total hydrocarbons were also made on several of the cores. Markedly elevated concentrations of copper, up to 362 ??g/g dry wt, were found in sediments which were collected close to the discharge points of oil refinery outfalls and which also showed concentrations of total hydrocarbons considerably greater than the background levels for the estuary. The results of selective chemical extractions showed that much of the copper was present in the non-lattice fraction of the sediment. Although the concentrations of Co, Ni, Zn and Cd were significantly correlated with those of copper in the core showing the highest concentrations of this element, these metals were not enhanced in comparison with the levels found in several other parts of the estuary. Variations in concentrations of metals in sediments throughout the estuary were not correlated with differences in organic carbon content. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {Construction of organic?inorganic hybrid materials with controlled mineralization analogous to those produced by nature is now of current interest for both organic and inorganic chemists to understand the mechanism of the natural biomineralization process as well as to seek industrial and technological applications. This review provides a general survey of recent research on control of crystal nucleation and growth of calcium carbonate by synthetic substrates from the viewpoint of organic and polymer chemistry. Model systems in which low-molecular-weight, linear polymeric, and dendritic organic additives are used to study the effect of molecular properties such as charge and functionality on inorganic crystallization are providing insights into the possible mechanisms operating in biology. To probe the organic?inorganic interface and resolve some of the molecular events mediating template-directed crystal nucleation and growth, a simple model surface, that is, compressed monolayers at the air/water interface and self-assembled monolayers on a solid surface, was used for the nucleation of oriented inorganic materials. The template-inhibition strategy for the synthesis of CaCO3 thin film has also been reported. Microscale phase separation in reaction media has importance in the synthesis of inorganic materials with unusual form and hierarchical structure. These interesting efforts have led to fundamental developments in areas relating to the biomineralization process, which is expected to be the impetus for the next industrial revolution.},

Although we agree with the authors that the long recognized uncertainty in the secular variation of $\delta$11Bseawater imposes a temporal limit on paleo-pH reconstructions, their evaluation of the $\delta$11B/pH relationship in carbonates is flawed. Potential complications from vital, temperature and dissolution effects reported in that paper are based on studies that are experimentally and/or analytically poorly constrained. Using published validation studies we will demonstrate that many of the problems outlined by Pagani et al. have already been addressed, or are based on misinterpretations of previous work.

abstract = {The sensitivities of benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca and Li/Ca to bottom water temperature and carbonate saturation state have recently been assessed. Here we present a new approach that uses paired Mg/Ca and Li/Ca records to calculate simultaneous changes in temperature and saturation state. Using previously published records, we first use this approach to document a cooling of deep ocean waters associated with the establishment of the Antarctic ice sheet at the Eocene-Oligocene climate transition. We then apply this approach to new records of the Middle Miocene Climate Transition from ODP Site 761 to estimate variations in bottom water temperature and the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater. We estimate that the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater varied by ∼1‰ between the deglacial extreme of the Miocene Climatic Optimum and the glacial maximum following the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, indicating large amplitude variations in ice volume. However, the longer-term change between 15.3 and 12.5 Ma is marked by a ∼1°C cooling of deep waters, and an increase in the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater of ∼0.6‰. We find that bottom water saturation state increased in the lead up to the Middle Miocene Climate Transition and decreased shortly after. This supports decreasing pCO2 as a driver for global cooling and ice sheet expansion, in agreement with existing boron isotope and leaf stomatal index CO2 records but in contrast to the published alkenone CO2 records.},

Throughout the life of a plant, the SAM produces stem tissues and lateral organs, and also regenerates itself. For correct growth, the plant must maintain a constant flow of cells through the meristem, where the input of dividing pluripotent stem cells offsets the output of differentiating cells. This flow depends on extracellular signaling within the SAM, governed by a spatial regulatory feedback loop that maintains a reservoir of stem cells, and on factors that prevent meristem cells from differentiating prematurely. The terminating floral meristem incorporates the spatial regulation scheme into a temporal regulation pathway involving flower patterning factors.},

abstract = {Bleaching refers to the loss of colour in symbioses between dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium and marine benthic animals, e.g. corals. Bleaching generally results in depressed growth and increased mortality, and it can be considered as a deleterious physiological response or ailment. An explanatory framework for the causes of bleaching comprises three elements: the external factors or triggers of bleaching, e.g. elevated temperature; the symptoms, including elimination of algal cells and loss of algal pigment; and the mechanisms, which define the response of the symbiosis to the triggers, resulting in the observed symptoms. The extent to which bleaching in different symbioses and in response to different triggers involves common mechanisms is currently unknown, but a contribution of interactions between the algal and animal partners to bleaching is predicted. Symbioses vary in their susceptibility to bleaching as a result of genetic variation in Symbiodinium and acclimatory responses of the animal. The evolutionary explanation for bleaching is obscure. Perhaps, bleaching was of selective advantage to the animal hosts under different (more benign?) environmental conditions than the present, or bleaching may be a negative by-product of an otherwise advantageous symbiotic trait, such as the elimination of damaged algal cells. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Black microcolonial fungi (MCF) and black yeasts are among the most stress-resistant eukaryotic organisms known on Earth. They mainly inhabit bare rock surfaces in hot and cold deserts of all regions of the Earth, but some of them have a close phylogenetic relation to human pathogenic black fungi which makes them important model organisms also with respect to clinical mycology. The environment of those fungi is especially characterized by extreme changes from humidity to long periods of desiccation and extreme temperature differences. A key to the understanding of MCF ecology is the question about metabolic activity versus dormancy in the natural environments. In this study, the time lag from the desiccated state to rehydration and full metabolic activity and growth was measured and defined in accordance with simulated environmental conditions. The ability to survive after desiccation and the speed of rehydration as well as changes of the whole cell protein pattern are demonstrated. Whereas both mesophilic strains--Exophiala jeanselmei and Knufia perforans (=Coniosporium perforans)--show a clear reaction toward desiccation by production of small proteins, Cryomyces antarcticus--the extremotolerant MCF--does not show any response to desiccation but seems just to down-regulate its metabolism. Data on intracellular sugar suggest that both trehalose and mannitol might play a cell protective role in those fungi.},

Experimental evidence suggests that if these trends continue, key marine organisms--such as corals and some plankton--will have difficulty maintaining their external calcium carbonate skeletons. Here we use 13 models of the ocean-carbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation under the IS92a 'business-as-usual' scenario for future emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections, Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2050. By 2100, this undersaturation could extend throughout the entire Southern Ocean and into the subarctic Pacific Ocean. When live pteropods were exposed to our predicted level of undersaturation during a two-day shipboard experiment, their aragonite shells showed notable dissolution. Our findings indicate that conditions detrimental to high-latitude ecosystems could develop within decades, not centuries as suggested previously.},

Incorporating extra complexity beyond simple nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) models is, however, fraught with difficulties: poorly understood ecology; lack of data; aggregating diversity within functional groups into meaningful state variables and constants; sensitivity of output to the parameterizations in question and their physical and chemical environment. Although regional models addressing the seasonal succession of plankton types have achieved some degree of success, predicted distributions of PFTs in global biogeochemical models have thus far been less than convincing. While the continued articulation of detail in ecosystem models is surely the way forward, I argue that this can only be so with due care and attention to the formulations employed and a healthy dose of scepticism regarding model outcomes. Future directions should emphasize building up complexity gradually, objective assessment of the resulting parameterizations, and variety in approach such as the use of empirical alternatives to the fully dynamic representation of PFTs in models.},

XAFS data suggest that Sr randomly substitutes for Ca within the shell aragonite. Sr/Ca in both the umbo and the outer shell exhibits significant seasonal variation but does not correlate with seawater temperature. Sr/Ca varies significantly between parallel transects across the same annual bands. Sr concentrations are highest in transects along the maximum growth axis of the outer shell but lowest in these transects in the umbo. Scanning electron microscopy indicates changes in crystal morphology both within and between transects. We do not, however, observe a clear relationship between shell growth rate and Sr/Ca.

abstract = {The growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)), the largest human contributor to human-induced climate change, is increasing rapidly. Three processes contribute to this rapid increase. Two of these processes concern emissions. Recent growth of the world economy combined with an increase in its carbon intensity have led to rapid growth in fossil fuel CO(2) emissions since 2000: comparing the 1990s with 2000-2006, the emissions growth rate increased from 1.3{\%} to 3.3{\%} y(-1). The third process is indicated by increasing evidence (P = 0.89) for a long-term (50-year) increase in the airborne fraction (AF) of CO(2) emissions, implying a decline in the efficiency of CO(2) sinks on land and oceans in absorbing anthropogenic emissions. Since 2000, the contributions of these three factors to the increase in the atmospheric CO(2) growth rate have been approximately 65 +/- 16{\%} from increasing global economic activity, 17 +/- 6{\%} from the increasing carbon intensity of the global economy, and 18 +/- 15{\%} from the increase in AF. An increasing AF is consistent with results of climate-carbon cycle models, but the magnitude of the observed signal appears larger than that estimated by models. All of these changes characterize a carbon cycle that is generating stronger-than-expected and sooner-than-expected climate forcing.},

abstract = {The ratio of calcium carbonate to organic carbon (C) production in the surface ocean is thought to be one of the key marine biotic climate variables, through its effect on ocean C cycling. This ratio is significantly affected by calcification and photosynthetic C fixation in coccolithophores. The abundance of coccolithophores and their rates of calcification and organic C fixation are in turn affected by climate-related changes in the ocean. However, there still exists disagreement on the strength of this feedback mechanism, which is due to the complexity of interactions of the factors regulating phytoplankton growth and ecosystem functioning. This review gives a qualitative overview on experimental and field data of coccolithophores, mainly Emiliania huxleyi, that are most relevant to actual oceanographic conditions and are likely to change in the foreseeable future under a changing climate. The focus is on the bottom-up control factors light, macronutrients, trace metals and carbon dioxide (CO2), which can be of use in modelling studies. Several trends have been identified that should be considered when attempting to simulate E. huxleyi growth. Light seems to be the central factor determining the occurrence of blooms. At low irradiance the calcite to organic C production ratio increases, but appears to decrease again when irradiance becomes severely limiting. Phosphate and nitrate limitation lead to an increase in the ratio of calcite to particulate organic carbon (POC), which is also shown for zinc but not for iron. This is mainly due to the fact that coccolith formation is generally less dependant on nutrient concentration than is cell replication. Finally, CO2-related effects in E. huxleyi and the other bloom-forming coccolithophore species Gephyrocapsa oceanica have been observed. Under high light conditions, calcification decreases with increasing CO2 concentration. Depending on the nutrient status of the cells, the production of POC strongly increases, or decreases under elevated CO2 concentrations. In contrast, under low light conditions no sensitivity of calcification to CO2 was observed, whereas POC production always strongly increases with CO2 under nutrient-replete conditions. How different growth conditions taken together finally affect coccolithophore calcification and organic C production is discussed for some factors, but needs further investigation. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The thin sheets of calcite, termed folia, that make up much of the shell of an oyster are covered by a layer of discrete globules that has been proposed to consist of agglomerations of protein and mineral. Foliar fragments, treated at 475 degrees C for 36 h to remove organic matter, were imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) as crystals grew on the foliar surfaces in artificial seawater at calcite supersaturations up to 52-fold. Crystals were also viewed later by scanning electron microscopy. After pyrolysis, the foliar globules persisted only as fragile remnants that were quickly washed away during AFM imaging, revealing an underlying morphology on the foliar laths of a tightly packed continuum of nanometer-scale protrusions. At intermediate supersaturations, crystal formation was seen immediately almost everywhere on these surfaces, each crystal having the same distinctive shape and orientation, even at the outset with crystals as small as a few nanometers. In contrast, nucleation did not occur readily on non-pyrolyzed foliar surfaces, and the crystals that did grow, although slowly at intermediate supersaturations, had irregular shapes. Possible crystallographic features of foliar laths are considered on the basis of the morphology of ectopic crystals and the atomic patterns of various surfaces. A model for foliar lath formation is presented that includes cycles of pulsed secretion of shell protein, removal of the protein from the mineralizing solution upon binding to mineral, and mineral growth at relatively high supersaturation over a time frame of about 1 h for each turn of the cycle.},

Over the last 100 years, the retreat signal has been especially strong in ice shelves of the Arctic and along the Antarctic Peninsula, with a more mixed signal elsewhere. For instance, since the early 1990s, the massive Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have thinned along the coasts but thickened in the interior, and since the late 1970s, sea ice has decreased in the Arctic but increased (slightly) in the Antarctic. Major difficulties in the interpretations of the climate record come from the high interannual variability of most cryosphere components and the lack of consistent long-term global data records; the latter problem is now being slowly remedied, in part, through satellite technology.},

abstract = {The Mingulay reef complex in the Sea of the Hebrides west of Scotland was first mapped in 2003 with a further survey in 2006 revealing previously unknown live coral reef areas at 120 to 190 m depth. Habitat mapping confirmed that distinctive mounded bathymetry was formed by reefs of Lophelia pertusa with surficial coral debris dating to almost 4000 yr. Benthic lander and mooring deployments revealed 2 dominant food supply mechanisms to the reefs: a regular rapid downwelling of surface water delivering pulses of warm fluorescent water, and periodic advection of high turbidity bottom waters. Closed chamber respirometry studies suggest that L. pertusa responds to seawater warming, such as that seen during the rapid downwelling events, with increases in metabolic rate. Lipid biomarker analysis implies that corals at Mingulay feed predominantly on herbivorous calanoid copepods. Integrating geophysical and hydrographical survey data allowed us to quantify the roles of these environmental factors in controlling biodiversity of attached epifaunal species across the reefs. Longitudinal structuring of these communities is striking: species richness ($\alpha$) and turnover ($\beta$) change significantly west to east, with variation in community composition largely explained by bathymetric variables that are spatially structured on the reef complex. Vibro-cores through the reef mounds show abundant coral debris with significant hiatuses. High resolution side-scan sonar revealed trawl marks in areas south of the coral reefs where vessel monitoring system data showed the highest density of local fishing activity. The interdisciplinary approach in this study allowed us to record the food supply and hydrographic environment experienced by L. pertusa and determine how it may be ecophysiologically adapted to these conditions. Improved basic understanding of cold-water coral biology and biodiversity alongside efforts to map and date these long-lived habitats are vital to development of future conservation policies.},

abstract = {The atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p(CO(2))) will almost certainly be double that of pre-industrial levels by 2100 and will be considerably higher than at any time during the past few million years. The oceans are a principal sink for anthropogenic CO(2) where it is estimated to have caused a 30{\%} increase in the concentration of H(+) in ocean surface waters since the early 1900s and may lead to a drop in seawater pH of up to 0.5 units by 2100 (refs 2, 3). Our understanding of how increased ocean acidity may affect marine ecosystems is at present very limited as almost all studies have been in vitro, short-term, rapid perturbation experiments on isolated elements of the ecosystem. Here we show the effects of acidification on benthic ecosystems at shallow coastal sites where volcanic CO(2) vents lower the pH of the water column. Along gradients of normal pH (8.1-8.2) to lowered pH (mean 7.8-7.9, minimum 7.4-7.5), typical rocky shore communities with abundant calcareous organisms shifted to communities lacking scleractinian corals with significant reductions in sea urchin and coralline algal abundance. To our knowledge, this is the first ecosystem-scale validation of predictions that these important groups of organisms are susceptible to elevated amounts of p(CO(2)). Sea-grass production was highest in an area at mean pH 7.6 (1,827 (mu)atm p(CO(2))) where coralline algal biomass was significantly reduced and gastropod shells were dissolving due to periods of carbonate sub-saturation. The species populating the vent sites comprise a suite of organisms that are resilient to naturally high concentrations of p(CO(2)) and indicate that ocean acidification may benefit highly invasive non-native algal species. Our results provide the first in situ insights into how shallow water marine communities might change when susceptible organisms are removed owing to ocean acidification.},

abstract = {Abstract One of the greatest mass extinctions in Earth's history occurred at the end of the Cretaceous era, sixty-five million years (Myr) ago. Considerable evidence indicates that the impact of a large asteroid or comet was the ultimate cause of this extraordinary event. At the time of mass extinction, the organic flux to the deep sea collapsed, and production of calcium carbonate by marine plankton radically declined. These biogeochemical processes did not fully recover for a few million years. The drastic decline and long lag in final recovery of these processes are most simply explained as consequences of open-ocean ecosystem alteration by the mass extinction. If this explanation is correct, the extent and timing of marine biogeochemical recovery from the end-Cretaceous event was ultimately contingent on the extent and timing of open-ocean ecosystem recovery. The biogeochemical recovery may in turn have created new evolutionary opportunities for a diverse array of marine organisms.},

Here we investigate whether there is similar sensitivity associated with uncertainties in the behaviour of the ocean carbon cycle. We investigate this important question using three models of the ocean carbon cycle of varying complexity: (1) a new three- box oceanic carbon cycle model; (2) the HILDA multibox model with high vertical resolution at low latitudes; (3) the Hadley Centre ocean general circulation model (HadOCC). These models were used in combination to assess the quantitative significance (to year 2100 pCO(2)) of potential changes to the ocean stimulated by global warming and other anthropogenic activities over the period 2000- 2100. It was found that an increase in sea surface temperature and a decrease in the mixing rate due to stratification give rise to the greatest relative changes in pCO(2), both being positive feedbacks. We failed to find any comparable large sensitivity due to the ocean.},

abstract = {We investigated the dynamics and toxicity of cyanobacteria populations in Lake Agawam, a eutrophic New York lake, and concurrently conducted experiments to evaluate the contrasting effects of zooplankton (mesozooplankton and microzooplankton) grazing and nutrient loading on the abundance and toxin content of cyanobacteria populations. Molecular techniques were used to assess the presence and expression of the microcystin synthetase gene. Lake Agawam hosted dense blooms ({\textgreater}105 cells mL-1) of Microcystis sp. and Anabaena sp. with consistently elevated levels of microcystin (1.0-25 ??g L-1) and lower levels of anatoxin-a (???1.0 ??g L-1 during late summer only). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis targeting the microcystin synthetase gene (mcyE) indicated that Microcystis sp., and not Anabaena sp., was responsible for microcystin production in this system. Moreover, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) indicated that the Microcystis population expressed the mcyE gene during summer months, but that gene expression declined to undetectable levels during the fall as in situ cell densities in the lake declined. During summer, when there was elevated Microcystis densities ({\textgreater}8 ?? 104 cells mL-1) expressing mcyE, experimental Daphnia sp. enrichment did not alter algal biomass (100{\%} of experiments; n = 6). However, during fall months when the mcyE gene expression was not detected and Microcystis densities were lower and declining (4 ?? 103 to 5 ?? 104 cells mL-1), zooplankton enrichment yielded significantly reduced (p {\textless} 0.05) cyanobacteria biomass relative to control treatments in most experiments (80{\%}; n = 4). In contrast to mesozooplankton, microzooplankton actively grazed algal biomass at significant rates (1.2 ?? 0.3 day-1) throughout the study. Microcystis and other cyanobacterial populations did not respond to nutrient amendments during early summer but experienced significantly increased growth rates and toxin concentrations (microcystin and anatoxin-a) during late summer and early fall nitrogen enrichment experiments. As such, the dominance of Microcystis sp. blooms during the summer was linked to nutrient replete conditions and the suppression of mesozooplankton (but not microzooplankton) grazing which itself appeared to be influenced by cellular toxin synthesis by Microcystis. The demise of the bloom was associated with N-limitation which reduced growth rates and toxin production by Microcystis and in turn may have permitted zooplankton to graze cells. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Techniques for the rapid preparation of atom-probe samples extracted directly from a Si wafer are presented and discussed. A systematic mounting process to a standardized microtip array allows approximately 12 samples to be extracted from a near-surface region and mounted for subsequent focused-ion-beam sharpening in a short period of time, about 2 h. In addition, site-specific annular mill extraction techniques are demonstrated that allow specific devices or structures to be removed from a Si wafer and analyzed in the atom-probe. The challenges presented by Ga-induced implantation and damage, particularly at a standard ion-beam accelerating voltage of 30 keV, are shown and discussed. A significant reduction in the extent of the damaged regions through the application of a low-energy "clean-up" ion beam is confirmed by atom-probe analysis of the damaged regions. The Ga+ penetration depth into {\{}1 0 0{\}} Si at 30 keV is ???40 nm. Clean-up with either a 5 or 2 keV beam reduces the depth of damaged Si to ???5 nm and {\textless}1 nm, respectively. Finally, a NiSi sample was extracted from a Si wafer, mounted to a microtip array, sharpened, cleaned up with a 5 keV beam and analyzed in the atom probe. The current results demonstrate that specific regions of interest can be accessed and preserved throughout the sample-preparation process and that this preparation method leads to high-quality atom probe analysis of such nano-structures. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Observation-based reconstructions of sea surface temperature from relatively stable periods in the past, such as the Last Glacial Maximum, represent an important means of constraining climate sensitivity and evaluating model simulations1. The first quantitative global reconstruction of sea surface temperatures during the Last Glacial Maximum was developed by the Climate Long-Range Investigation, Mapping and Prediction (CLIMAP) project in the 1970s and 1980s (refs 2, 3). Since that time, several shortcomings of that earlier effort have become apparent4. Here we present an updated synthesis of sea surface temperatures during the Last Glacial Maximum, rigorously defined as the period between 23 and 19 thousand years before present, from the Multiproxy Approach for the Reconstruction of the Glacial Ocean Surface (MARGO) project5. We integrate microfossil and geochemical reconstructions of surface temperatures and include assessments of the reliability of individual records. Our reconstruction reveals the presence of large longitudinal gradients in sea surface temperature in all of the ocean basins, in contrast to the simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum climate available at present6, 7.},

@article{Rosenthal1997,
abstract = {Surface sediments from Little Bahama Bank(LBB), intersecting the subtropical thermocline, were used to assess the influence of temperature on the incorporation of Mg, Sr, F, and Cd into shells of benthic foraminifera. Samples were obtained from twelve box cores along the southern slope of LBB, covering a temperature range of 18-4.5 degrees C between 301 and 1585 m. We studied the composition of ten calcitic and one aragonitic species, which are often used in paleochemical reconstructions. Mg/Ca ratios decrease with increasing water depth in all benthic species, both with calcitic and aragonitic mineralogy, showing a strong correlation with water temperature. Similar decrease is seen in Sr/Ca but with no correlation with temperature. None of the benthic species studied here exhibits a depth or temperature related change in F/Ca. Similar trends are observed when using an ocean-wide dataset, which includes shallow and deep core tops (300-5000 m). We suggest that temperature is the primary control on the Mg content of benthic foraminifera. Based on inorganic precipitation experiments and thermodynamic considerations, presented here, a 30-40{\%} decrease in the Mg distribution coefficient in calcite may be expected as a result of a temperature change from 25 degrees C to 5 degrees C, which is about half the observed change in LBB. A calibration curve applied to C. pachyderma data from core tops along the slope of Little Bahama Bank suggests that water temperature may be inferred from Mg/Ca ratios with an uncertainty of about +/-0.8 degrees C. Therefore, the Mg content of benthic foraminifera may provide a new, independent temperature proxy for studying shallow waters paleoceanography. The linear decrease in Sr/Ca with increasing depth is not correlated with temperature; the trend is constant from the ocean surface down to 5 km, suggesting that pressure related effects on the calcification process are a more likely explanation than post-depositional dissolution. Mg/Ca ratios in aragonitic shells of H. elegans covary with temperature, in accord with recent observations from corals. In contrast, the Sr and F chemistry of H. elegans is very different than that of corals and inorganically precipitated aragonites. The disparities between the elemental composition of biogenic and inorganic phases and the large intergeneric and interspecific differences observed both in planktonic and benthic foraminifera implicate temperature related physiological processes in regulating the coprecipitation of elements in foraminiferal shells. Our work demonstrates that Cd/Ca ratios of shallow calcitic species reflect the vertical distribution of nutrients; no significant influence of temperature on the partitioning of Cd into the shells was found. Our data extend the previous deep water calibration (Boyle, 1992), thereby allowing for the reconstruction of the nutrient chemistry of shallow thermocline waters.

This paper describes the two different types of structure observed, one in the upper elements, the other in the basal plate, or lower element. The former consisted of small, microdomain structures of 300-500 angstrom (1 angstrom = 10-10 m) in length with no strong orientation. At places along these elements, and particularly in the junction between stem and head pieces, triangular patterns of lattice fringes were observed indicating multiple nucleation sites in the structure. In contrast, the lower element consisted of a very thin single crystalline sheet of calcite which could be resolved into a two dimensional lattice image, shown by a computer program that is capable of simulating electron diffraction patterns and lattice images to be a [421] zone of calcite. A possible mechanism for these growth patterns in the formation of coccoliths is discussed, together with the relevance of such mechanisms to biomineralization generally.},

abstract = {The Mg/Ca ratio of planktonic foraminifera is widely used for reconstructing sea surface and thermocline temperatures. Dissolution, driven by changes in the bottom water calcite saturation state (a function of water mass chemistry and depth/pressure), lowers the bulk Mg/Ca ratio which results in an implied cooler reconstructed temperature. Here we employ electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) to characterize how dissolution alters shell Mg/Ca variability. Using EMPA we have generated Mg/Ca image maps of two species widely used in paleoceanographic reconstructions: Globogerinoides ruber sensu stricto (G. ruber s.s.) and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei (N. dutertrei). We first characterize the Mg/Ca ratio in the better-preserved shells from a shallow core (2.8 km) and compare those characteristics to the samples from a deep core (4.0 km) obtained from the same locality (Ceara Rise, western equatorial Atlantic). Though preliminary, results suggest EMPA Mg/Ca ratio mapping can reveal characteristics of well preserved shells that can be used to assess changes in the Mg/Ca ratio that occur with dissolution.},

abstract = {Warm hydrothermal springs were discovered on Baby Bare, which is an isolated basement outcrop on 3.5 Ma-old crust on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. We have sampled these spring waters from a manned submersible, along with associated sediment pore waters from 48 gravity and piston cores. Systematic variations in the chemical composition of these waters indicate that hydrothermal reactions in basement at moderate temperatures (63??C in uppermost basement at this site) remove Na, K, Li, Rb, Mg, TCO2, alkalinity, and phosphate from the circulating seawater and leach Ca, Sr, Si, B, and Mn from the oceanic crust; and that reactions with the turbidite sediment surrounding Baby Bare remove Na, Li, Mg, Ca, Sr, and sulfate from the pore water while producing ammonium and Si and both producing and consuming phosphate, nitrate, alkalinity, Mn, and Fe. K, Rb, and B are relatively unreactive in the sediment column. These data confirm the earlier inference that sediment pore waters from areas of upwelling can be used to estimate the composition of altered seawater in the underlying basement, even for those elements that are reactive in the sediment column or are affected by sampling artifacts. The composition of altered seawater in basement at Baby Bare is similar to the inferred composition of 58??C formation water from crust nearly twice as old (5.9 Ma) on the southern flank of the Costa Rica Rift. The Baby Bare fluids also exhibit the same directions of net elemental transfer between basalt and seawater as solutions produced in laboratory experiments at a similar temperature, and complement compositional changes from seawater observed in seafloor basalts altered at cool to moderate temperatures. The common parameter among the two ridge flanks and experiments is temperature, suggesting that the residence time of seawater in basement at the two ridge-flank sites is sufficiently long for the solutions to equilibrate with altered basalt. This conclusion is supported by compilations of data from other ridge-flank sites, which show a systematic relationship between inferred basement water composition and temperature. We use the Baby Bare spring waters along with constraints from the riverine flux of Mg to estimate upper limits on the global fluxes of 14 elements at warm ridge-flank sites such as Baby Bare. Maximum calculated fluxes of Mg, Ca, sulfate, B, and K may equal or exceed 25{\%} of the riverine flux, and such sites may represent the missing, high K/Rb sink required for the K budget. Additional fluxes from/to the crust on ridge flanks are expected from cool ({\textless}20-25??C) hydrothermal sites. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM), which plays a functional role in plant physiology, is a source of chronic human disease, forming the major inorganic component of kidney stones. Understanding molecular mechanisms of biological control over COM crystallization is central to development of effective stone disease therapies and can help define general strategies for synthesizing biologically inspired materials. To date, research on COM modification by proteins and small molecules has not resolved the molecular-scale control mechanisms. Moreover, because proteins directing COM inhibition have been identified and sequenced, they provide a basis for general physiochemical investigations of biomineralization. Here, we report molecular-scale views of COM modulation by two urinary constituents, the protein osteopontin and citrate, a common therapeutic agent. Combining force microscopy with molecular modeling, we show that each controls growth habit and kinetics by pinning step motion on different faces through specific interactions in which both size and structure determine the effectiveness. Moreover, the results suggest potential for additive effects of simultaneous action by both modifiers to inhibit the overall growth of the crystal and demonstrate the utility of combining molecular imaging and modeling tools for understanding events underlying aberrant crystallization in disease.},

abstract = {Like the marine ray Taeniura lymma, the African lungfish Protopterus dolloi possesses carbamoyl phosphate III (CPS III) in the liver and not carbamoyl phosphate I (CPS I), as in the mouse Mus musculus or as in other African lungfish reported elsewhere. However, similar to other African lungfish and tetrapods, hepatic arginase of P. dolloi is present mainly in the cytosol. Glutamine synthetase activity is present in both the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of the liver of P. dolloi. Therefore, we conclude that P. dolloi is a more primitive extant lungfish, which is intermediate between aquatic fish and terrestrial tetrapods, and represents a link in the fish-tetrapod continuum. During 6 days of aerial exposure, the ammonia excretion rate in P. dolloi decreased significantly to 8-16{\%} of the submerged control. However, there were no significant increases in ammonia contents in the muscle, liver or plasma of specimens exposed to air for 6 days. These results suggest that (1). endogenous ammonia production was drastically reduced and (2). endogenous ammonia was detoxified effectively into urea. Indeed, there were significant decreases in glutamate, glutamine and lysine levels in the livers of fish exposed to air, which led to a decrease in the total free amino acid content. This indirectly confirms that the specimen had reduced its rates of proteolysis and/or amino acid catabolism to suppress endogenous ammonia production. Simultaneously, there were significant increases in urea levels in the muscle (8-fold), liver (10.5-fold) and plasma (12.6-fold) of specimens exposed to air for 6 days. Furthermore, there was an increase in the hepatic ornithine-urea cycle (OUC) capacity, with significant increases in the activities of CPS III (3.8-fold), argininosuccinate synthetase + lyase (1.8-fold) and, more importantly, glutamine synthetase (2.2-fold). This is the first report on the upregulation of OUC capacity and urea synthesis rate in an African lungfish exposed to air. Upon re-immersion, the urea excretion rate increased 22-fold compared with that of the control specimen, which is the greatest increase among fish during emersion-immersion transitions and suggests that P. dolloi possesses transporters that facilitate the excretion of urea in water.},

abstract = {Corals open an exceptional window into many phenomena of geological, geochemical, climatic, and paleontological interest. From the Paleozoic to the present, corals provide some of the finest high-resolution archives of marine conditions. Corals are likewise exceptional for chronometric purposes, and even the terrestrial 14C timescale has now been calibrated against coral 230Th/234U. Corals also represent a testing ground for basic ideas about mineralogy and geochemistry. The shapes, sizes, and organization of skeletal crystals have been attributed to factors as diverse as mineral supersaturation levels and organic mediation of crystal growth. The coupling between calcification and photosynthesis in symbiotic corals is likewise attributed to everything from photosynthetic alkalinization of the water, to efforts by the coral to prevent photosynthetic alkalinization. Corals also leave a significant geochemical imprint on the oceans. Their aragonite skeletons accept about 10 times more strontium than does calcite, hence the proportion of marine aragonite precipitation affects the oceanic chemical balance. Biological carbonates represent the biosphere's largest carbon reservoir, hence calcareous organisms affect the ocean's pH, CO2 content, and ultimately global temperatures through the greenhouse gas connection. Finally, corals present some geochemical puzzles for ecology and conservation. How do symbiotic corals obtain nutrients in some of the most nutrient deficient parts of the planet? Are global geochemical changes partially responsible for the widespread declines in coral reefs during recent decades? We will address many of these issues, but will concentrate on coral skeletal structure and calcification mechanism. These topics bear most directly on the biomineralization process and generally affect the choice of skeletal materials and analytical techniques used in geochemical investigations.},

We conclude that Mg/Ca ratios in monospecific benthic foraminiferal samples may be used as a reliable temperature proxy, if the lifetime of the species is taken into account.},

abstract = {This essay comments on recent research on Darwinian fisheries science and on the future development of this field. From a practical point of view, the key question is: how fast are evolutionary changes caused by fishing happening? To answer this question, there is a need to understand intensities of selection generated by fishing, heritabilities and genetic correlations of the traits under selection, and whether the rates of change in traits predicted from this information are consistent with the changes observed. Although there is little doubt about the existence of phenotypic change in life-history traits of exploited fish stocks, there are few direct estimates of selection differentials caused by fishing. Results that are available, together with the relatively low heritabilities of life-history traits, suggest that the evolution caused by fishing occurs at a modest rate, and is likely to need a decadal time scale to be clearly observable. Given the pressing need for attention to fisheries in the short term, measures to control the longer-term evolutionary impact of fishing are most likely to be adopted if they also help to meet short-term objectives of management. With this in mind, the essay mounts a defence of large, old fish, the presence of which would be beneficial to stocks in the short term, and the conservation of which would set in motion selection for improved growth in the longer term.},

abstract = {The room-temperature Raman spectra of aragonite, magnesite and dolomite have been recorded up to 30 GPa and 25 GPa, respectively and no phase changes were observed during compression, unlike calcite. The effect of temperature on the room-pressure Raman spectra of calcite, aragonite, magnesite and dolomite is reported up to 800-11 00 K. The measured relative pressure.and temperature-shifts of the Raman lines are greater for the lattice modes than for the internal modes of the CO3 groups. These shifts are used to calculate the mode anharmonic parameters of the observed Raman modes; they are negative and their absolute values are smaller (close to 0) for the internal CO3 modes than for the lattice modes (4-17 10(-5) K-1). The temperature shifts of the lattice modes in calcite are considerably larger than those for dolomite and magnesite, and a marked non-linear increase in linewidth is observed above 400-degrees-C for calcite. This is consistent with an increasing relaxational component to the libration of the CO3 groups about their threefold axes, premonitory to the rotational order-disorder transition at higher temperature. This behaviour is not observed for the other calcite structured minerals in this study. We examine systematic variations in the lattice mode frequencies and linewidths with composition, to begin to understand these differences in their anharmonic behaviour. Finally, we have used a simple Debye-Waller model to calculate atomic displacements in calcite, magnesite and dolomite with increasing temperature from the vibrational frequency data, to provide a direct comparison with atomic positional data from high-temperature structure refinements.},

abstract = {It has long been recognised that some oceanic regions have persistently low-chlorophyll levels, even though there are abundant inorganic nutrients. Studies have shown that these high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) areas are depleted in iron, an essential micronutrient. In these regions biological production can be enhanced with artificial mesoscale iron fertilisation. However, the ability of iron-induced blooms to efficiently sequester carbon to mesopelagic depths is still an open question. It is hypothesised that sub-Antarctic islands in the HNLC Southern Ocean are also a source of iron and thus fuel the natural phytoplankton blooms observed in their proximity, thereby enhancing levels of particulate organic carbon (POC) export. To test the third part of this hypothesis, POC export was measured in the Southern Ocean region of the Crozet Islands (52 degrees E, 46 degrees S) during the austral summer of 2004/2005 as part of the CROZEX project. Based on satellite imagery, a high-chlorophyll region (maximum concentration = 4 mu g l(-1)) north and downstream of the islands was distinguished from a low-chlorophyll region (typical concentration = 0.3 mu g l(-1)) south and upstream of the islands. POC export estimates were obtained by using the naturally occurring particle-reactive radionuclide tracer Th-234. POC export was initially 15 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) in the high-chlorophyll bloom region, compared with 5 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) in the low-chlorophyll, non-bloom region. After a moderately small bloom at the southern control stations (max concentration = 0.7 mu g l(-1)) the spatial variability in POC export was lost, resulting in equally high levels of POC export (ca. 20 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) throughout the study region. Comparison of Th-234-derived POC export with estimates of new production, calculated from nitrate budgets, revealed evidence for a decoupling of new and export production, with this effect most apparent within the northern bloom area. In addition to methodological issues this apparent decoupling of new and export production could be due to a buildup of dissolved organic nitrogen within the bloom region, thus reducing the amount of POC available for export to mesopelagic depths.

Pregnant mice were fed a transgenic soybean or a non-transgenic (conventional) diet through gestation and lactation. After weaning, the young male mice were maintained on the respective diets. At 8, 16, 26, 32, 63 and 87 days after birth, three male mice and an adult reference mouse were killed, the testes surgically removed, and the cell populations measured by flow cytometry. Multi-generational studies were conducted in the same manner. The results showed that the transgenic foodstuffs had no effect on macromolecular synthesis or cell growth and differentiation as evidenced by no differences in the percentages of testicular cell populations (haploid, diploid, and tetraploid) between the transgenic soybean-fed mice and those fed the conventional diet. Additionally, there were no differences in litter sizes and body weights of the two groups. It was concluded that the transgenic soybean diet had no negative effect on fetal, postnatal, pubertal or adult testicular development. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The links between dissolved arsenic speciation, biological activity and the availabilities of the nitrogen and phosphorus plant nutrients have been investigated in a seasonal survey of Southampton Water (U.K.). Southampton Water (Hampshire, southern England) is an approximately 10km long, and 2km wide north-westerly extension of the Solent, receiving water from the rivers Test and Itchen. It is a partially mixed estuary bordered by broad intertidal mudflats with shingle and sand on the eastern side, and a salt marsh to the west. Two sites were chosen: NW Netley Buoy is in a sheltered high-salinity estuarine environment whilst Calshot Buoy lies just outside Southampton Water and in a more exposed location of less-variable salinity. The first evidence of arsenic(III) production at both sites occurred in the second half of April, during the decay of a majorSkeletonema costatumdiatom bloom. Arsenic(III) levels rose asSkeletonemawas replaced by a numerically smaller but more chlorophyll-rich bloom of another diatom,Rhizosolenia delicatula. Rhizosoleniais therefore implicated as a possible source of arsenic(III). Methylated arsenic was absent whilst the water temperature was low and during the initialSkeletonemabloom, but a week later, during the growth phase of the succeeding bloom of the diatomR. delicatula, they became detectable. Methylated arsenic levels gradually increased through the spring to a broad maximum covering the mid-summer, whenMesodinium rubrum,Scrippsiella trochoideaand associated microflagellates also peaked. No subsequent single organism could be linked to the release of methylated arsenic into Southampton Water; organoarsenicals having been observed in the presence of flagellates, diatoms and ciliates. A large bacterial maximum was observed following blooms ofS. trochoideaandM. rubrumbut laboratory culture experiments of natural bacteria from Netley failed to produce significant changes in the concentration of any arsenic species. Phosphate depletion did not appear to be a prerequisite for arsenate assimilation. From the summer peak methylated arsenic levels then gradually diminished to undetectable levels in the winter months. Monomethylarsenic, present at concentrations approximately 50{\%} those of dimethylarsenic, persisted longer through the summer. The arsenic species which can be measured using the hydride procedure may therefore represent intermediates in the decomposition of the bioarsenicals, such as arsenosugars, which are released, either actively as excretion/secretion products or passively as part of the decay process. Currently unidentified precursors of hydride-reducible arsenic species (‘hidden' arsenic) may explain the poor link between planktonic activity and the levels of measurable arsenic species in the water column.},

abstract = {The empirical and conceptual relationships between Earth surface processes and global changes are very complex. The concept that "the present is the key of the future" implies that we know enough the present to be able to extend our knowledge forward to focus on the future. Field and remote observations on the present-day Earth surface processes represent the methodological instruments for the forecasting. At the end of the 1980s, the scientific community predicted a significant increase of global warming followed by changes in the trends of related surface processes. Some processes, such as the Arctic and Antarctic snow melting are now accelerating and even irreversible; thus these trends show that we are now in an 'out of scale' discontinuity moment. Present-day measures and observations could be scarcely significant and may add uncertainty in the prediction of future trends. The 'out-of-scale' trend raises a fundamental question regarding the present, since it may provide a new angle of thought for contemporary theoretical approaches. The need for reducing the uncertainty in the trends of future processes requires a deep rethinking of the current paradigms in order to consider also the 'out of scale' trends.},

abstract = {Many biominerals, including mollusk and echinoderm shells, avian eggshells, modern and fossil bacterial sediments, planktonic coccolithophores, and foraminifera, contain carbonates in the form of biogenic aragonite or calcite. Here we analyze biogenic and geologic aragonite using different kinds of surface- and bulk-sensitive X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy at the carbon K-edge, as well as high-resolution scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM). Besides the well-known main pi* and sigma* carbonate peaks, we observed and fully characterized four minor peaks, at energies between the main pi* and sigma* peaks. As expected, the main peaks are similar in geologic and biogenic aragonite, while the minor peaks differ in relative intensity. In this and previous work, the minor peaks appear to be the ones most affected in biomineralization processes, hence the interest in characterizing them. Peak assignment was achieved by correlation of polarization-dependent behavior of the minor peaks with that of the main pi* and sigma* peaks. The present characterization provides the background for future studies of aragonitic biominerals.},

abstract = {To the Editor: Ecological studies can help ensure that new  biotechnologies provide maximum benefit while minimizing  detrimental effects. Accordingly, a recent study (1) published  in PNAS is appropriate but lacks the genetic and toxicological  components necessary for proper execution and interpretation.  The study used different maize hybrids. Because all maize  hybrids differ in many traits, any trait that differs between the  hybrids, e.g., the level of trypsin inhibitors present, could easily  explain the results. Because isogenic lines were not used, it  is impossible to attribute the observed effect to Bt as opposed  to any other factor that differed.  The study assumed that pollen from currently grown Bt  maize contains toxic levels of Bt when the levels in pollen are  negligible (2) and innocuous (3). The presence and type of Bt  toxin was never verified or quantified. If any Bt was present,  the level administered to the larvae is unknown. Yet, dose–  response measurements are key to establishing toxicity.  Even if their results were really due to Bt, it is impossible  to extrapolate with any confidence from an aquarium to a  whole ecosystem where many more variables come into play.  Given these limitations, the conclusion that ``widespread  planting of Bt crops has unexpected ecosystem-scale consequences''  is untenable. The data cannot even support the  more tentative conclusion that ``Bt corn byproducts may have  negative effects,'' because no cause and effect was shown specific  to Bt.

abstract = {Photosynthetic uptake of inorganic carbon can raise the pH adjacent to cyanobacterial cells, promoting CaCO(3) precipitation. This effect is enhanced by CO(2) concentrating mechanisms that actively transport HCO(3)(-) into cells for carbon fixation. CO(2) concentrating mechanisms presumably developed in response to atmospheric decrease in CO(2) and increase in O(2) over geological timescales. In present-day cyanobacteria, CO(2) concentrating mechanisms are induced when the atmospheric partial pressure of CO(2) (p(CO2)) falls below similar to 0.4{\%}. Reduction in p(CO2) during the Proterozoic may have had two successive effects on cyanobacterial calcification. First, fall in p(CO2) below similar to 1{\%} (33 times present atmospheric level, PAL) resulted in lower dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations that reduced pH buffering sufficiently for isolated CaCO(3) crystals to begin to nucleate adjacent to cyanobacterial cells. As a result, blooms of planktic cyanobacteria induced precipitated 'whitings' of carbonate mud in the water column whose sedimentary accumulation began to dominate carbonate platforms similar to 1400-1300 Ma. Second, fall in p(CO2) below similar to 0.4{\%} (10 PAL) induced CO(2)-concentrating mechanisms that further increased pH rise adjacent to cells and promoted in vivo cyanobacterial sheath calcification. Crossing of this second threshold is indicated in the fossil record by the appearance of Girvanella 750-700 Ma. Coeval acquisition of CO(2) concentrating mechanisms by planktic cyanobacteria further stimulated whiting production. These inferences, that p(CO2) fell below similar to 1{\%} similar to 1400-1300 Ma and below similar to 0.4{\%} 750-700 Ma, are consistent with empirical and modelled palaeo-atmosphere estimates. Development of CO(2) concentrating mechanisms was probably temporarily slowed by global cooling similar to 700-570 Ma that favoured diffusive entry of CO(2) into cells. Lower levels of temperature and DIC at this time would have reduced seawater carbonate saturation state, also hindering cyanobacterial calcification. It is suggested that as Earth emerged from 'Snowball' glaciations in the late Neo-proterozoic, global warming and O(2) rise reactivated the development of CO(2) concentrating mechanisms. At the same time, rising levels of temperature, calcium ions and DIC increased seawater carbonate saturation state, stimulating widespread cyanobacterial in vivo sheath calcification in the Early Cambrian. This biocalcification event promoted rapid widespread development of calcified cyanobacterial reefs and transformed benthic microbial carbonate fabrics.},

abstract = {The Mg/Ca ratio within foraminiferal calcareous tests (shells) is widely used to reconstruct past seawater temperature. However, recent studies reported that the organic components within a test affect the Mg/Ca distribution. In this study, we have measured the Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, and Ba/Ca ratios within the planktonic foraminifera Pulleniatina obliquiloculata by using a NanoSIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS)), which has excellent spatial resolution (∼1 $\mu$m) and allows us to compare the distribution of chemical compositions with that of the organic components. Element compositions show banding distributions composed of alternately higher and lower values of those elemental ratios. The Mg/Ca ratios, previously considered to be mainly controlled by calcification temperature, show larger variations than the values expected from the seawater temperature at the habitat depth of P. obliquiloculata. Comparison of the elemental distribution with the test microstructure reveals that the bands of high Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios correspond with layers of the organic components. Such coincidence suggests that the organic components strongly affect the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios within a test. In spite of the heterogeneous distribution, temperature estimated from the averaged Mg/Ca ratio within a test is consistent with seawater temperature at the habitat depth of P. obliquiloculata, indicating that whole Mg/Ca ratio of foraminiferal test may be useful as paleotemperature proxy. In contrast to the Mg/Ca ratio the heterogenity in Ba/Ca ratio, which previously has been considered to be mainly controlled by the ambient seawater composition, is not fully matched with the layers of the organic compositions. Although the organic components concentrate Ba, other unknown factors appear to also cause heterogenity in Ba incorporation.},

abstract = {During a period of about 16 hours prior to gamete release, "gametogenic calcification" in Globigerinoides sacculifer deposits calcite over its last-formed chambers, averaging about 9 ??m in thickness but varying in individual specimens from a thin veneer to a "calcite crust" up to 16 ??m in thickness. This process adds on the average about 28{\%} by weight to the pre-gametogenic shell. The formation of a sac-like chamber generally precedes gametogenesis by about 24 to 48 hours. Gametogenic shell thickening was studied by comparing wall thicknesses and microstructural differences between pre-gametogenic shells in plankton tows and post-gametogenic shells in laboratory culture and surface sediments. Pre-gametogenic shells have generally thin walls, well-developed polygonal patterns of sharp ridges, elongate spines and deep pore basins with terraced surfaces, whereas post-gametogenic shells have thicker walls, euhedral or irregularly lumpy calcareous deposits, broad interpore ridges, "spine-holes" (due to resorption of all spines), and pore basins which may or may not be filled to the point of constriction. A smooth thin veneer often covers the post-gametogenic shell and hides the terraced interpore areas. Gametogenic calcification is believed to occur below the euphotic zone to a depth of several hundred meters. Thus the additionally secreted calcite has significant implications in paleoecological reconstructions based on stable isotopic and trace-element compositions of their shells. The ability to distinguish between pre- and post-gametogenic specimens also opens up an avenue of determining the past fertility and age structure of death assemblages of planktonic foraminifera. ?? 1980.},

abstract = {The first complete cyclic sedimentary successions for the early Paleogene from drilling multiple holes have been retrieved during two ODP expeditions: Leg 198 (Shatsky Rise, NW Pacific Ocean) and Leg 208 (Walvis Ridge, SE Atlantic Ocean). These new records allow us to construct a comprehensive astronomically calibrated stratigraphic framework with an unprecedented accuracy for both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans covering the entire Paleocene epoch based on the identification of the stable long-eccentricity cycle (405-kyr). High resolution X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanner and non-destructive core logging data from Sites 1209 through 1211 (Leg 198) and Sites 1262, 1267 (Leg 208) are the basis for such a robust chronostratigraphy. Former investigated marine (ODP Sites 1001 and 1051) and land-based (e.g., Zumaia) sections have been integrated as well. The high-fidelity chronology is the prerequisite for deciphering mechanisms in relation to prominent transient climatic events as well as completely new insights into Greenhouse climate variability in the early Paleogene. We demonstrate that the Paleocene epoch covers 24 long eccentricity cycles. We also show that no definite absolute age datums for the K/Pg boundary or the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) can be provided by now, because of still existing uncertainties in orbital solutions and radiometric dating. However, we provide two options for tuning of the Paleocene which are only offset by 405-kyr. Our orbitally calibrated integrated Leg 208 magnetostratigraphy is used to revise the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) for Chron C29 to C25. We established a high-resolution calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy for the South Atlantic which allows a much more detailed relative scaling of stages with biozones. The re-evaluation of the South Atlantic spreading rate model features higher frequent oscillations in spreading rates for magnetochron C28r, C27n, and C26n. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental results unambiguously demonstrate the selective formation of aragonite kind vaterite in numerous cases. Further analysis indicates that these metastable phases may be correlated with negatively charged substrate surfaces. This correlation is observed in all cases except for SiO2. We suspect the exception is possibly due to the active dissolution of SiO2 at the experimental pH conditions. Additional results from experiments using pretreated aluminum silicate oil which hydrated amorphous silica surface coating, is generated by acid leaching support the dissolution hypothesis. These findings suggest that inorganic surface functional groups may have the ability similar to organic ones in selectively inducing metastable carbonate polymorph crystallization.},

abstract = {The11B/10B ratio in calcite and aragonite is an important proxy of oceanic water pH. However, the physico-chemical mechanisms underpinning this approach are still poorly known. In the present study, we theoretically determine the equilibrium isotopic fractionation properties of structural boron species in calcium carbonates, BO33−, BO2(OH)2−and B(OH)4−anions substituted for carbonate groups, as well as those of B(OH)4−and B(OH)3species in vacuum. Significant variability of equilibrium isotopic fractionation properties is observed among these structural species which is related to their contrasted coordination state, B–O bond lengths and atomic-scale environment. The isotopic composition of structural boron does not only depend on its coordination number but also on its medium range environment, i.e. farther than its first coordination shell. The isotopic fractionation between aqueous species and their counterparts in vacuum are assessed using previous investigations based on similar quantum-mechanical modeling approaches. At 300 K, the equilibrium isotope composition of structural trigonal species is 7–15‰ lighter than that of aqueous boric acid molecules, whereas substituted tetrahedral borate ions are heavier than their aqueous counterparts by 10–13‰. Although significant uncertainties are known to affect the theoretical prediction of fractionation factors between solids and solutions, the usually assumed lack of isotopic fractionation during borate incorporation in carbonates is challenged by these theoretical results. The present theoretical equilibrium fractionation factors between structural boron and aqueous species differ from those inferred from experiments which may indicate that isotopic equilibrium, unlike chemical equilibrium, was not reached in most experiments. Further research into the isotopic fractionation processes at the interface between calcium carbonates and aqueous solution as well as long duration experiments aimed at investigating the kinetics of equilibration of boron environment and isotopic composition are therefore required to refine our understanding of boron coprecipitation in carbonates and thus the theory behind the use of boron isotopes as an ocean pH proxy.},

abstract = {Unionid shells are characterized by an outer aragonitic prismatic layer and an inner nacreous layer. The prisms of the outer shell layer are composed of single-crystal fibres radiating from spheruliths. During prism development, fibres progressively recline to the growth front. There is competition between prisms, leading to the selection of bigger, evenly sized prisms. A new model explains this competition process between prisms, using fibres as elementary units of competition. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray texture analysis show that, during prism growth, fibres become progressively orientated with their three crystallographic axes aligned, which results from geometric constraints and space limitations. Interestingly transition to the nacreous layer does not occur until a high degree of orientation of fibres is attained. There is no selection of crystal orientation in the nacreous layer and, as a result, the preferential orientation of crystals deteriorates. Deterioration of crystal orientation is most probably due to accumulation of errors as the epitaxial growth is suppressed by thick or continuous organic coats on some nacre crystals. In conclusion, the microstructural arrangement of the unionid shell is, to a large extent, self-organized with the main constraints being crystallographic and geometrical laws.},

abstract = {Reconstructions of past changes in the seawater calcium concentration (Casw) are critical for understanding the long-term changes in ocean chemistry, the carbon cycle and for accurate application of elemental proxies (El/CaCaCO3) in foraminifera (e.g., Mg/Ca as proxy of temperature). Here we show that Na/Ca ratios in foraminiferal shells could be used for reconstructing Casw and Mg/Ca in the past oceans. Ca has a short residence time in the ocean (∼1 My), whereas Na in seawater has a residence time of ∼100 My. Hence it may be reasonably assumed that Nasw is invariant over the Cenozoic, enabling variations in oceanic Ca to be deduced from foraminiferal Na/Ca (Na/Cashell) if Na incorporation into foraminiferal shells depends on Na/Ca in seawater. Furthermore, the paleo-concentrations of other major and minor elements may then be calculated relative to the Ca in the shells, provided that other environmental or biological factors do not present a further complication. To evaluate this hypothesis, we cultured the benthic foraminifer Operculina ammonoides, an extant relative of the Eocene Nummulites, under varying Casw and temperature. The foraminifera grew well under the experimental conditions and increased their weight by 40–90{\%}. The newly grown calcite (identified using a 135Ba labeling in the experimental seawater) was analyzed by Laser-Ablation ICP-MS for Li, Na, Mg and Sr to Ca ratios. The relationship between Na/Ca and Mg/Ca in the shell and their ratio in the solution are best described as a power function, where the instantaneous distribution coefficient is the derivative of the power fit to the El/Cashell versus El/Casw. In contrast, DSr and DLi are invariant with El/Casw. The influence of temperature on Li, Na and Sr incorporation was smaller than the uncertainty of our measurements. We conclude that Na/Ca in foraminiferal shells can be used to calculate paleo-calcium concentrations in the oceans and also other elements that may change relative to calcium (e.g., Mg, Sr, Li and others).},

abstract = {We have sought to directly test the assumption that the Ba Ca ratio of foraminifera shells is proportional to the Ba Ca ratio of the seawater in which the shells precipitated via experiments with living planktonic foraminifera. Specimens of the symbiont-bearing species, Orbulina universa, were grown in seawater with five different Ba concentrations at a temperature of 22??C. Individual foraminifera shells (spherical chambers) were then cleaned and analyzed for Ba Ca. We found that the response for Ba incorporation is linear within and somewhat above the range of Ba concentrations found in the ocean. The calculated distribution coefficient for Ba incorporation lies between 0.14 and 0.17. The value determined previously by comparison of core-top fossil planktonic foraminifera and surface water compositions was 0.19 ?? 0.05. Foraminifera grown under low-light conditions to simulate reduced symbiont photosynthetic activity did not have significantly different Ba Ca. This suggests that for this species, biogenic precipitation rates of calcite varying in response to changing light levels do not affect the degree of Ba discrimination. Earlier observations of Ba incompatibility and lack of substitution in inorganically precipitated calcite at higher Ba activities do not apply to coprecipitation of Ba in the planktonic foraminifera Orbulina over the range of Ba concentrations found in seawater. ?? 1992.},

The resultant pH values in the presence of plants ranged from 6.5 to 8.7. The maximum calcification rate appears to lie between 0.11 and 1.05{\%} PCO 2.

abstract = {The aspartate-rich macromolecules found at nucleation sites of calcifying organisms are widely implicated in regulating biomineral formation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that their ability to influence the onset of nucleation and composition of calcified structures may arise from effects on ion hydration. This study investigates the interactions of acidic amino acids and dipeptides with hydrated cations using molecular dynamics. By monitoring the hydration states of Mg2+, Ca2+, and Sr2+ during their approach to negatively charged molecules, we show that carboxylate moieties of Asp promote dehydration of Ca2+ and Sr2+. A contact ion pair (CIP) is not required to disrupt cation hydration, and we demonstrate that reductions and rearrangements of first shell water can begin at ion-Asp separation distances as large as approximately 4.9 A for Ca2+ and approximately 5.1 A for Sr2+. CIP formation between Ca2+ and Sr2+ and carboxylate groups decreases the total first shell coordination number from an average of 8.0 and 8.4 in bulk water to 7.5 and 8.0, respectively. The energy barrier to physically replacing waters about Ca2+ with carboxylate oxygen atoms is small (approximately 2 kcal/mol) as compared to a somewhat larger barrier for Sr2+ (approximately 4 kcal/mol). This may be explained by differences in the strength of Coulombic interactions between the cations and the Asp, resulting in different paths of approach toward Asp for Ca2+ and Sr2+. In contrast, the primary solvation shell of Mg2+ remains largely unchanged during interactions with Asp until the abrupt physical replacement of water by carboxylate oxygen atoms, which comes at a high energetic cost. These insights support the claim that carboxylated biomolecules increase the growth rate of calcite by lowering the energy barrier to Ca2+ dehydration. The findings also suggest a physical basis for the idea that ion-specific behaviors of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in cellular systems arise from a critical balance between water binding in the ion hydration shells versus their interactions with ligands present in intracellular environments.},

abstract = {Nucleation in the natural world often occurs in the presence of organic interfaces. In mineralized tissues, a range of macromolecular matrices are found in contact with inorganic phases and are believed to direct mineral formation. In geochemical settings, mineral surfaces, which are often covered with organic or biological films, surround the volume within which nucleation occurs. In the classical picture of nucleation, the presence of such interfaces is expected to have a profound effect on nucleation rates, simply because they can reduce the interfacial free energy, which controls the height of the thermodynamic barrier to nucleation of the solid phase. However, the recent discovery of a nearly monodisperse population of calcium carbonate clusters-so called pre-nucleation clusters-and the many observations of amorphous precursor phases have called into question the applicability of classical descriptions. Here we use in situ observations of nucleation on organothiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to explore the energetics and pathways of calcite nucleation at organic interfaces. We find that carboxyl SAM-directed nucleation is described well in purely classical terms through a reduction in the thermodynamic barrier due to decreased interfacial free energy. Moreover, the differences in nucleation kinetics on odd and even chain-length carboxyl SAMs are attributable to relative differences in these energies. These differences arise from varying degrees of SAM order related to oxygen-oxygen interactions between SAM headgroups. In addition, amorphous particles formed prior to or during crystal nucleation do not grow and are not observed to act as precursors to the crystalline phase. Instead, calcite appears to nucleate independently. These results imply that the recently proposed model of calcite formation as a non-classical process, one which proceeds via aggregation of stable pre-nucleation clusters that form an amorphous precursor from which the crystalline phase emerges, is not applicable to template-directed nucleation on carboxyl SAMs and does not provide a universal description of calcite formation.},

abstract = {Mg-calcites commonly occur in natural environments, with Mg-contents ranging between about 0 and 32 mol{\%} (referring to MgCO3). Often, different Mg-calcite phases occur within the same sample. The Mg-content in calcites permits the classification of the diagenetic environment (marine vs. meteoric), or the reconstruction of paleotemperatures from skeletal remains. Since the 1960s, there have been published various calibrations for Mg determination in calcites based on XRD measurements. Recently, this method has come to be superseded by wet chemical, laser ablation, and microprobe analysis, due to their higher accuracy and/or higher sample resolution of these latter methods. This study presents a new calibration for the Mg determination in calcites using XRD measurements analyzed by means of the Rietveld refinement method. The calibration is based on lattice parameters and exhibits a reliable Mg-determination accuracy of more than 0.8 mol{\%} between 0 and 15.5 mol{\%}. The incorporation of the calibration into the Rietveld refinement software TOPAS permits a fast, standardized workflow. This, in turn, enhances the user-friendliness and the reproducibility of results, as well as allows the simultaneous analysis of multiple Mg-calcites in a sample. Mixtures of two Mg-calcites were analyzed using this new method. The Mg-content of two co-occurring Mg-calcite phases can be reliably quantified providing the Mg-calcites differ by at least 4.9 mol{\%} and the minor Mg-calcite phase makes up more than 2.7 wt{\%}. If the Mg-calcite phases differ by 3.4 mol{\%} or less, the reliable identification of different Mg-calcite phases is questionable, due to the fact that differences involved here are too small. If such XRD patterns are refined with only one Mg-calcite phase, then the systematic misfit between measured and refined pattern can be used for the identification of a second Mg-calcite phase down to a difference in the Mg-content of about 3 mol{\%}. However, a reliable phase quantification for these patterns cannot be achieved.},

However, the mechanisms involved in the carbonate biomineralization process are poorly understood. The current paradigm holds that calcium ions for the test are supplied primarily by endocytosis of seawater. Here, we combine confocal-laser scanning-microscopy observations of a membrane-impermeable fluorescent marker in the extant benthic species Ammonia aomoriensis with dynamic Ca-44-labeling and NanoSIMS isotopic imaging of its test. We infer that Ca for the test in A. aomoriensis is supplied primarily via trans-membrane transport, but that a small component of passively transported (e. g., by endocytosis) seawater to the site of calcification plays a key role in defining the trace-element composition of the test. Our model accounts for the full range of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca observed for benthic Foraminifera tests and predicts the effect of changing seawater Mg/Ca ratio. This places foram-based paleoclimatology into a strong conceptual framework.},

abstract = {The potential negative biological and environmental impacts of sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean by means of ocean fertilization (1) or direct CO2 injection (2) are discussed in a Policy Forum and Perspective, respectively, in Science's 12 October issue. However, the oceans already serve as a repository of anthropogenic CO2, ingassing and storing {\~{}}2 picograms of carbon per year, an amount that could potentially have significant consequences for marine biota (3). The issue, therefore, is to reduce CO2 emissions or their impacts in ways that provide a net environmental benefit. It remains to be shown if the negative consequences of the purposeful ocean CO2 sequestration strategies are real and worse than other alternatives. Should the environmental and climatic effects of unmitigated CO2 release to the atmosphere make CO2 sequestration a necessity, the potential of the oceans for such a repository should not be ignored. One way to avoid some of the negative chemical and biological effects of ocean CO2 storage would be first to react waste CO2 with water and a carbonate mineral (e.g., limestone) to form dissolved bicarbonate (4) for release into the sea. This would simply speed up part of Earth's natural carbon cycle (carbonate weathering), which is already central in modulating atmospheric CO2, but over geologic time scales (5). The addition of alkalinity to the ocean resulting from this enhanced bicarbonate production would also help to buffer ocean acidification attributable to anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere (3). In any case, there are other ways to diminish the impact of our energy economy on the environment (6), and it would be shortsighted not to evaluate our options carefully.},

We analyzed local experiments, long-term regional time series, and global fisheries data to test how biodiversity loss affects marine ecosystem services across temporal and spatial scales. Overall, rates of resource collapse increased and recovery potential, stability, and water quality decreased exponentially with declining diversity. Restoration of biodiversity, in contrast, increased productivity fourfold and decreased variability by 21{\%}, on average. We conclude that marine biodiversity loss is increasingly impairing the ocean's capacity to provide food, maintain water quality, and recover from perturbations. Yet available data suggest that at this point, these trends are still reversible. },

abstract = {Temperatures derived from Mg/Ca ratios of the calcite tests of planktonic foraminifera are distorted when samples are partially dissolved, and methods are required to quantify this source of inaccuracy. Here we compare a dissolution index (XDX), based on X-ray computed tomography scans, to Mg/Ca of four species of foraminifera (G. ruber (white), G. sacculifer (without sac), N. dutertrei, and P. obliquiloculata) from core top sediments from the tropical Pacific, Atlantic, and western Indian Ocean. Deepwater calcite saturation values ($\Delta$[CO32−]) at the sites ranged from 55 to −23 $\mu$mol/kg. An estimate of $\Delta$Mg/Ca (reduction in Mg/Ca due to dissolution) was made for each sample. $\Delta$Mg/Ca decreased linearly from deepwater $\Delta$[CO32−] values of between 10 (±4) and 15 (±5) $\mu$mol/kg. These values are minimum estimates of the threshold below which Mg/Ca is affected by dissolution, as they are limited by assumptions made in calculating $\Delta$Mg/Ca. Sensitivity of Mg/Ca to $\Delta$[CO32−] was greatest for G. ruber, where Mg/Ca decreased by 0.102 (±0.036) mmol/mol per $\mu$mol/kg. Sensitivity was similar for G. sacculifer (0.047 ± 0.015 mmol/mol per $\mu$mol/kg), N. dutertrei (0.037 ± 0.010 mmol/mol per $\mu$mol/kg), and P. obliquiloculata (0.040 ± 0.008 mmol/mol per $\mu$mol/kg). Sensitivity was similar at all sites for each species, excepting an apparently greater response for N. dutertrei from the Caribbean compared to other sites. Calibrations between XDX and $\Delta$Mg/Ca provide a means to estimate dissolution bias on Mg/Ca. Poor correlation between XDX and $\delta$18O suggests that, for the small sample size typical for analysis, variability in initial $\delta$18O overwhelms dissolution effects.},

abstract = {Since the landmark contributions of Homer Smith and co-workers in the 1930s there has been a considerable advance in our knowledge regarding the osmoregulatory strategy of elasmobranch fish. Smith recognised that urea was retained in the body fluids as part of the 'osmoregulatory ballast' of elasmobranch fish so that body fluid osmolality is raised to a level that is iso- or slightly hyper-osmotic to that of the surrounding medium. From studies at that time he also postulated that many marine dwelling elasmobranchs were not capable of adaptation to dilute environments. However, more recent investigations have demonstrated that, at least in some species, this may not be the case. Gradual acclimation of marine dwelling elasmobranchs to varying environmental salinities under laboratory conditions has demonstrated that these fish do have the capacity to acclimate to changes in salinity through independent regulation of Na+, Cl- and urea levels. This suggests that many of the presumed stenohaline marine elasmobranchs could in fact be described as partially euryhaline. The contributions of Thomas Thorson in the 1970s demonstrated the osmoregulatory strategy of a fully euryhaline elasmobranch, the bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas, and more recent investigations have examined the mechanisms behind this strategy in the euryhaline elasmobranch, Dasyatis sabina. Both partially euryhaline and fully euryhaline species utilise the same physiological processes to control urea, Na+ and Cl- levels within the body fluids. The role of the gills, kidney, liver, rectal gland and drinking process is discussed in relation to the endocrine control of urea, Na+ and Cl- levels as elasmobranchs acclimate to different environmental salinities. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Oceanic anthropogenic CO2 uptake will decrease both the pH and the aragonite saturation state ($\Omega$arag) of seawater leading to an oceanic acidification. However, the factors controlling future changes in pH and $\Omega$arag are independent and will respond differently to oceanic climate change feedbacks such as ocean warming, circulation and biological changes. We examine the sensitivity of these two CO2-related parameters to climate change feedbacks within a coupled atmosphere-ocean model. The ocean warming feedback was found to dominate the climate change responses in the surface ocean. Although surface pH is projected to decrease relatively uniformly by about 0.3 by the year 2100, we find pH to be insensitive to climate change feedbacks, whereas $\Omega$arag is buffered by ∼15{\%}. Ocean carbonate chemistry creates a situation whereby the direct pH changes due to ocean warming are almost cancelled by the pH changes associated with dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations changes via a reduction in CO2 solubility from ocean warming. We show that the small climate change feedback on future surface ocean pH is independent to the amount of ocean warming. Our analysis therefore implies that future projections of surface ocean acidification only need to consider future atmospheric CO2 levels, not climate change induced modifications in the ocean.},

The clear state was not stable in the long term, however, because of high nutrient loadings. 3. In 1999, another removal of zooplanktivorous fish (mainly rudd) had similar effects as in 1987, although macrophytes returned more slowly. 4. In the years directly following both interventions there was a 'transition period' of very clear water with high densities of zooplanktonic grazers in the absence of macrophytes; low oxygen concentrations indicate that during those years primary production was low relative to heterotrophic activity. 5. The transition period appears to provide the light climate necessary for the return of macrophytes. 6. Reduction of nutrient loading is necessary to improve water quality in Lake Zwemlust in the long term. In the short term, repeated fish stock reduction is a reasonable management strategy to keep Lake Zwemlust clear.},

abstract = {Calcite growing from an aqueous solution containing growth-inhibiting cations such as Mn2+ can acquire oscillatory zoning of trace elements by this feedback: The growth-induced H+ buildup at the growth surface makes the surface more positive, thus preventing inhibiting cations from attaching to the growth sites and accelerating the growth rate. The increase in growth rate in turn further accelerates H+ accumulation. This feedback is quantitatively modeled by a system of nonlinear differential equations that takes account of calcite growth, inhibition, diffusion, and mass continuity. For parameter values consistent with actual aqueous-ion diffusivities and concentrations in diagenetic waters, numerical solutions of the system of equations yield both oscillatory calcite growth and oscillatory concentration profiles of trace elements taken up by the calcite. The plausibility of the feedback makes it unnecessary to interpret oscillatory zoning of trace elements in calcite by calling on ad-hoc, large-scale, periodic changes in bulk water chemistry. ?? 1992.},

We have measured B/Ca ratios in Globigerina bulloides and Globorotalia inflata for a series of core tops from the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean and in Globigerinoides ruber (white) from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) site 668B on the Sierra Leone Rise in the eastern equatorial Atlantic. B/Ca ratios in these species of planktonic foraminifera seem unaffected by dissolution on the seafloor. K-D shows a strong species-specific dependence on calcification temperature, which can be corrected for using the Mg/Ca temperature proxy. A preliminary study of G. inflata from Southern Ocean sediment core CHAT 16K suggests that temperature-corrected B/Ca was similar to 30{\%} higher during the last glacial. Correspondingly, pH was 0.15 units higher and aqueous PCO2 was 95 mu atm lower at this site at the Last Glacial Maximum. The covariation between reconstructed PCO2 and the atmospheric pCO(2) from the Vostok ice core demonstrates the feasibility of using B/Ca in planktonic foraminifera for reconstructing past variations in pH and PCO2.},

Compared to measurements made during the 1960s–1970s at DK13 in the same season, Pg increased from 833 to 914 mmol O2{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}d−1 and Pg:R increased from 1.14 to 1.30, indicating that the reef has become more autotrophic. In contrast, Gnet decreased from 133 mmol C{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}d−1 to 74 ± 24 mmol C{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}d−1. This decrease stems primarily from the threefold increase in nighttime CaCO3 dissolution from −2.5 mmol{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}h−1 to −7.5 mmol{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}h−1. Comparison of the benthic community survey results from DK13 and its vicinity conducted during this study and in studies from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s suggest that there have been no significant changes in the live coral coverage during the past 40 years. The reduced Gnet most likely reflects the almost threefold increase in dissolution rates, possibly resulting from increased bioerosion due to changes in the biota (e.g., sea cucumbers, boring organisms) and/or from greater chemical dissolution produced by changing abiotic conditions over the past 40 years associated with climate change, such as increased temperatures and ocean acidification. However, at this stage of research on One Tree Island the effects of these changes are not entirely understood. },

abstract = {We estimate the magnesium stable isotopic composition ($\delta$26Mg) of the major compartments involved in the biomineralisation process of euryhaline bivalve, the manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. Our aim is to identify the fractionation processes associated with Mg uptake and its cycling/transport in the bivalve organism, in order to better assess the controlling factors of the Mg isotopic records in bivalve shells. $\delta$26Mg were determined in seawater, in hemolymph, extrapallial fluid (EPF), soft tissues and aragonitic shell of adult clams collected along the Auray River estuary (Gulf of Morbihan, France) at two sites showing contrasted salinity regimes. The large overall $\delta$26Mg variations (4.16‰) demonstrate that significant mass-dependent Mg isotopic fractionations occur during Mg transfer from seawater to the aragonitic shell.Soft tissues span a range of fractionation factors relative to seawater ($\delta$26Mgsoft tissue-seawater) of 0.42±0.12‰ to 0.76±0.12‰, and show evidence for biological isotopic fractionation of Mg. Hemolymph and EPF are on average isotopically close to seawater ($\delta$26Mghemolymph-seawater=-0.20±0.27‰; 2sd; n=5 and $\delta$26MgEPF-seawater=-0.23±0.25‰; 2sd; n=5) indicating (1) a predominant seawater origin for Mg in the intercellular medium and (2) a relatively passive transfer route through the bivalve organism into the calcifying fluid. The lightest isotopic composition is found in shell, with $\delta$26Mg ranging from -1.89±0.07‰ to -4.22±0.06‰. This range is the largest in the dataset and is proposed to result from a combination of abiotic and biologically-driven fractionation processes. Abiotic control includes fractionation during precipitation of aragonite and accounts for $\delta$26Mgaragonite-seawater≈1000ln$\alpha$aragonite-seawater=-1.13±0.28‰ at 20°C based on literature data. Deviations from inorganic precipitate (expressed as $\delta$26MgPhysiol) appear particularly variable in the clam shell, ranging from 0.03‰ to -2.20‰, which indicates that bivalve shell formation can proceed either under fractionation similar to inorganically-precipitated aragonite or under variable physiological influences. These physiological isotopic effects may be consistent with a regulation of dissolved Mg content in hemolymph and/or EPF due to Mg incorporation into soft tissue and/or Mg fixation by organic macromolecules. Using closed- and open-system models we estimate that $\delta$26MgPhysiol can be satisfactorily resolved with a remaining Mg fraction in hemolymph and/or EPF of 74{\%} down to 2{\%}. However, this feature is not reflected in our hemolymph and EPF data and may indicate that regulation processes and isotopic fractionation may take place in self-contained spaces located close to calcification sites. The potential role of the shell organic matrix, which may host non-lattice-bound Mg in the shell, is also discussed but remains difficult to assess with our data.Regarding the large physiological effects, the $\delta$26Mg record in the Manila clam shell offers limited potential as a proxy of temperature or seawater Mg isotopic composition. In contrast, the sensitivity of its $\delta$26Mg to the salinity regime may offer an interesting tool to track changes in clam biological activity in estuarine environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The utilization of inorganic carbon species by the marine microalga Phaeocystis globosa (Prymnesiophyceae) and several other algal species from different taxa, was investigated by determining the time course of 14C incorporation in isotopic disequilibrium experiments. From these kinetic data, conclusions can be drawn about the carbon species, CO2, or HCO3 that is being utilized. By comparing the uptake kinetics in the absence and presence of acetazolamide (AZ) or dextran-bound sulfonamide, inhibitors of external carbonic anhydrase (CA), it was determined that P. globosa, Dunaliella tertiolecta, and some strains of Emiliania huxleyi do use HCO3 - by extracellular, CA-catalyzed conversion to CO2, which then diffuses across the membrane. Nannochloropsis, Thalassiosira pseudonanna, and often Synechococcus use HCO3 - without extracellular conversion. Thalasiosira punctigera, some strains of E. huxleyi, and Rhodomonas sp. use exclusively free CO2. The presence of extracellular CA activity in Phaeocystis is not constitutive but is induced under low inorganic carbon conditions. Thus, marine microalgae show variability in carbon acquisition strategy for one single species, depending on external conditions, and in carbon acquisition strategy between species. Determining AZ-induced changes in carbon uptake kinetics provides a sensitive test for the presence of extracellular CA activity. With the potentiometric method, no CA activity could be measured, whereas with the isotopic disequilibrium technique, significant CA activity could be detected.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates that intracrystalline organic matter in coral skeletons is well preserved over century timescales. The extent of preservation of organic matter in coral skeletons was investigated by measuring total organic carbon (TOC), total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA), chloropigment, and lipid concentrations in 0-300 year old annual growth bands from Montastraea annularis (Florida Keys) and Porites lutea (Red Sea). Organic matter intrinsic to the calcium carbonate mineral (intracrystalline) was analyzed separately from total skeletal organic matter. The Red Sea coral had less TOC (0.02-0.04 wt{\%}) than the Florida Keys coral (0.04-0.11 wt{\%}), but a higher percent of intracrystalline organic matter in all annual bands measured. Carbon in the form of THAA, most likely from mineral-precipitating proteins, contributed 30-45{\%} of the TOC in both corals. Carbon in lipids represented about 3{\%} of the TOC in the coral skeletons. Chlorophyll-a and b were present in annual bands where endolithic algae were present, but these compounds were minor contributors to TOC. The distribution of specific organic compounds showed that organic matter was well preserved throughout the time period sampled in both the total and intracrystalline pools. Variations in THAA were not correlated with TOC over time, suggesting that organic matter that is involved in biomineralization, like amino acids, may be deposited in response to different environmental factors than are other components of skeletal organic matter. Differences in the quantity and composition of organic matter between the two corals investigated here were assessed using principal components analysis and suggest that location, species and skeletal structure may all influence organic matter content and possibly the degree of physical protection of organic matter by the coral skeleton. Further, our study suggests that intracrystalline organic matter may be better protected from diagenesis than non-intracrystalline organic matter and may therefore be a more reliable source of organic matter for paleoceanographic studies than total skeletal organic matter. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Total body oxygen stores were estimated from measures of hematocrit, hemoglobin, myoglobin, and total blood volume and were used to calculate an aerobic dive limit (ADL). Movement patterns and diving behavior were measured by equipping the seal with a Satellite Relay Data Logger that transmitted data from 831 August 2002. The seal remained in a focal area, in contrast to crabeater seals tracked simultaneously. The seal displayed short, shallow dives (mean 2.01.4 min, 4448 m) and spent 99.9{\%} of its time within the estimated ADL of 7.4 min. The shallow diving behavior contradicts previous diet research suggesting Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is the primary prey of leopard seals during the winter months as krill were found at deeper depths during this period. These measurements of diving and movement of a leopard seal provide valuable preliminary data necessary to develop future research on the at-sea behavior of an apex predator in the Antarctic ecosystem.},

abstract = {In recent years, the concept of self-organization has been used to understand collective behaviour of animals. The central tenet of self-organization is that simple repeated interactions between individuals can produce complex adaptive patterns at the level of the group. Inspiration comes from patterns seen in physical systems, such as spiralling chemical waves, which arise without complexity at the level of the individual units of which the system is composed. The suggestion is that biological structures such as termite mounds, ant trail networks and even human crowds can be explained in terms of repeated interactions between the animals and their environment, without invoking individual complexity. Here, I review cases in which the self-organization approach has been successful in explaining collective behaviour of animal groups and societies. Ant pheromone trail networks, aggregation of cockroaches, the applause of opera audiences and the migration of fish schools have all been accurately described in terms of individuals following simple sets of rules. Unlike the simple units composing physical systems, however, animals are themselves complex entities, and other examples of collective behaviour, such as honey bee foraging with its myriad of dance signals and behavioural cues, cannot be fully understood in terms of simple individuals alone. I argue that the key to understanding collective behaviour lies in identifying the principles of the behavioural algorithms followed by individual animals and of how information flows between the animals. These principles, such as positive feedback, response thresholds and individual integrity, are repeatedly observed in very different animal societies. The future of collective behaviour research lies in classifying these principles, establishing the properties they produce at a group level and asking why they have evolved in so many different and distinct natural systems. Ultimately, this research could inform not only our understanding of animal societies, but also the principles by which we organize our own society.},

The two temperature records display similar patterns during the last 28,000 years but the SST Mg/Ca estimates are several degrees warmer (???+4??C) than SST MAT. The temperature shift between SST Mg/Ca and SST MAT remained relatively constant over time. This seems to exclude a bias on the Mg/Ca record associated with salinity or secondary Mg-rich calcite encrustation on the foraminiferal tests during early diagenesis. Therefore, anomalously high Mg/Ca suggests either: (1) the empirical equation for G. bulloides of Elderfield and Ganssen (2000) is incorrect; or (2) there is a specific Mediterranean genotypes of G. bulloides for which a specific Mg/Ca-temperature calibration is needed. . ?? 2012 Acad??mie des sciences.},

abstract = {A new mixed layer multi-nutrient ecosystem model, incorporating diatoms, non-diatoms and zooplankton, is described that models the role of iron in marine biogeochemical cycles. The internal cell biochemistry of the phytoplankton is modelled using the mechanistic model of Flynn [2001. A mechanistic model for describing dynamic multi-nutrient, light, temperature interactions in phytoplankton. Journal of Plankton Research 23, 977-997] in which the internal cell concentrations of chlorophyll, nitrogen, silica, and iron are all dynamic variables that respond to external nutrient concentrations and light levels. Iron stress in phytoplankton feeds back into chlorophyll synthesis and changes in photosynthetic unit (PSU) size, thereby reducing their growth rate. Because diatom silicon metabolism is inextricably linked with cell division, diatom population density (cell m-3) is modelled as well as C biomass. An optimisation technique was used to fit the model to three time-series datasets at Biotrans (47??N, 20??W) and Kerfix (50??40???S, 68??25???E) and the observations for the Southern Ocean Iron-Release Experiment (SOIREE) iron-enrichment experiment (61??S, 140??E). The model gives realistic simulations of the annual cycles of nutrients, phytoplankton, and primary production at Biotrans and Kerfix and can also accurately simulate an iron fertilisation experiment. Specifically, the model predicts the high values of diatom Si:N and Si:C ratios observed in areas where iron is a limiting factor on algal growth. In addition, the model results at Kerfix confirm previous suggestions that underwater light levels have a more limiting effect on phytoplankton growth than iron supply. The model is also used to calculate C budgets and C and Si export from the mixed layer. The implications of these results for developing biogeochemical models incorporating the role of iron are discussed. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, A Tutorial Introduction with R and BUGS, is for first year graduate students or advanced undergraduates and provides an accessible approach, as all mathematics is explained intuitively and with concrete examples. It assumes only algebra and ‘rusty' calculus. Unlike other textbooks, this book begins with the basics, including essential concepts of probability and random sampling. The book gradually climbs all the way to advanced hierarchical modeling methods for realistic data. The text provides complete examples with the R programming language and BUGS software (both freeware), and begins with basic programming examples, working up gradually to complete programs for complex analyses and presentation graphics. These templates can be easily adapted for a large variety of students and their own research needs.The textbook bridges the students from their undergraduate training into modern Bayesian methods.-Accessible, including the basics of essential concepts of probability and random sampling -Examples with R programming language and BUGS software -Comprehensive coverage of all scenarios addressed by non-bayesian textbooks- t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and comparisons in ANOVA, multiple regression, and chi-square (contingency table analysis). -Coverage of experiment planning -R and BUGS computer programming code on website -Exercises have explicit purposes and guidelines for accomplishment},

abstract = {Among the microbial phototrophs, those belonging to the cyanobacteria utilize CO2 and HCO-3 for photosynthesis. Some Chlorophyceae mainly take up CO2 in photosynthesis, and others, which have carbonic anhydrase (CA) on their cell surface can utilize HCO-3 as well as CO2. Kinetic studies revealed that most of the HCO-3 is utilized after this ion is converted to CO2 via CA located on the cell surface. Therefore, the actual molecular species which crosses the plasmalemma is mostly free CO2. There is apparent variation in the mode of utilization of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) for photosynthesis in microalgae in other classes. The apparent Km(CO2) values for photosynthesis in most microalgae grown in ordinary air (low-CO2 cells) are as low as in terrestrial C4 plants, although the algal cells fix CO2 via the C3 pathway. In contrast, the apparent Km(CO2) values in cells grown on CO2-enriched air (high-CO2 cells) are as high as those in the terrestrial C3 plants. Most low-CO2 cells show low photorespiration; a low CO2 compensation point, low rates of glycolate excretion and no or low O2 inhibition of photosynthesis. These results indicate that the efficiency of DIC utilization for photosynthesis in low-CO2 cells is very high. The activity of CA in low-CO2 cells is higher than that in high-CO2 cells, while no difference has been confirmed in the activities of other photosynthetic enzymes between low- and high-CO2 cells. In addition, low-CO2 cells can accumulate large amounts of DIC internally, indicating the existence of CO2-concentrating mechanisms in these cells. When CA activity or CO2 concentrating ability is reduced by inhibitors or by mutation, the apparent Km(CO2) values for photosynthesis and the rate of photorespiration increased notably. These results indicate that the high efficiency of DIC utilization in low-CO2 cells depends on both CA and a CO2-concentrating mechanism. It is concluded that CA facilitates the diffusion of DIC from outside the cells to the site(s) of the carboxylation reaction and the concentration of DIC is achieved via an active transporter. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {The vulnerability of the human brain to injury following just a few minutes of oxygen deprivation with submergence contrasts markedly with diving mammals, such as Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii), which can remain underwater for more than 90 min while exhibiting no neurological or behavioural impairment. This response occurs despite exposure to blood oxygen levels concomitant with human unconsciousness. To determine whether such aquatic lifestyles result in unique adaptations for avoiding ischaemic-hypoxic neural damage, we measured the presence of circulating (haemoglobin) and resident (neuroglobin and cytoglobin) oxygen-carrying globins in the cerebral cortex of 16 mammalian species considered terrestrial, swimming or diving specialists. Here we report a striking difference in globin levels depending on activity lifestyle. A nearly 9.5-fold range in haemoglobin concentration (0.17-1.62 g Hb 100 g brain wet wt(-1)) occurred between terrestrial and deep-diving mammals; a threefold range in resident globins was evident between terrestrial and swimming specialists. Together, these two globin groups provide complementary mechanisms for facilitating oxygen transfer into neural tissues and the potential for protection against reactive oxygen and nitrogen groups. This enables marine mammals to maintain sensory and locomotor neural functions during prolonged submergence, and suggests new avenues for averting oxygen-mediated neural injury in the mammalian brain.},

abstract = {Ocean biogeochemical and ecosystem processes are linked by net primary production (NPP) in the ocean's surface layer, where inorganic carbon is fixed by photosynthetic processes. Determinations of NPP are necessarily a function of phytoplankton biomass and its physiological status, but the estimation of these two terms from space has remained an elusive target. Here we present new satellite ocean color observations of phytoplankton carbon (C) and chlorophyll (Chl) biomass and show that derived Chl:C ratios closely follow anticipated physiological dependencies on light, nutrients, and temperature. With this new information, global estimates of phytoplankton growth rates ({\&}{\#}956;) and carbon-based NPP are made for the first time. Compared to an earlier chlorophyll-based approach, our carbon-based values are considerably higher in tropical oceans, show greater seasonality at middle and high latitudes, and illustrate important differences in the formation and demise of regional algal blooms. This fusion of emerging concepts from the phycological and remote sensing disciplines has the potential to fundamentally change how we model and observe carbon cycling in the global oceans.},

abstract = {The majority of scientific papers on the subject of respiratory patterns in insects have dealt with the discontinuous gas-exchange cycle (DGC). The DGC is characterized by the release of bursts of CO(2) from the insect, followed by extended periods of spiracular closure. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the evolutionary origin and physiological function of this unusual respiratory pattern. We expand upon one of these (the oxidative damage hypothesis) to explain not only the occurrence of the DGC but also the mechanistic basis for the transition to two other well-characterized respiratory patterns: the cyclic pattern and the continuous pattern. We propose that the specific pattern employed by the insect at any given time is a function of the amount of oxygen contained in the insect at the time of spiracular closure and the aerobic metabolic rate of the insect. Examples of each type of pattern are shown using the insect Rhodnius prolixus. In addition, contrary to the expectations deriving from the hygric hypothesis, it is demonstrated that the DGC does not cease in Rhodnius in humid air.},

abstract = {Pesticides, including organophosphate (OP), organochlorine (OC), and carbamate (CB) compounds, are widely used in agricultural and indoor purposes. OP and CB act as acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors that affect lots of organs such as peripheral and central nervous systems, muscles, liver, pancreas, and brain, whereas OC are neurotoxic involved in alteration of ion channels. There are several reports about metabolic disorders, hyperglycemia, and also oxidative stress in acute and chronic exposures to pesticides that are linked with diabetes and other metabolic disorders. In this respect, there are several in vitro and in vivo but few clinical studies about mechanism underlying these effects. Bibliographic databases were searched for the years 1963-2010 and resulted in 1652 articles. After elimination of duplicates or irrelevant papers, 204 papers were included and reviewed. Results indicated that OP and CB impair the enzymatic pathways involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and protein within cytoplasm, mitochondria, and proxisomes. It is believed that OP and CB show this effect through inhibition of AChE or affecting target organs directly. OC mostly affect lipid metabolism in the adipose tissues and change glucose pathway in other cells. As a shared mechanism, all OP, CB and OC induce cellular oxidative stress via affecting mitochondrial function and therefore disrupt neuronal and hormonal status of the body. Establishing proper epidemiological studies to explore exact relationships between exposure levels to these pesticides and rate of resulted metabolic disorders in human will be helpful.},

abstract = {Crystal growth and coprecipitation experiments demonstrate the manner in which surface structure and, in turn, crystal structure influence growth mechanism and trace element incorporation in calcite. Dominant {\{}1014{\}} faces grow by the spiral mechanism, producing asymmetric polygonized growth hillocks comprised of two pairs of nonequivalent vicinal faces. Trace elements Mg, Mn, and Sr are differentially incorporated into structurally distinct growth steps that comprise the nonequivalent vicinal faces. The resulting trace element distributions represent intrasectoral zoning patterns and are found to be consistent with face symmetry. Lateral spreading rates are also different for nonequivalent growth steps at a given degree of supersaturation, and the rate anisotropy is dependent on the Ca2+:CO3
2- ratio in the growth solution. A rounding transition associated with changes in kink site density occurs preferentially on only one pair of equivalent growth steps, further demonstrating the importance of step-specific kinetics and affinities on {\{}1014{\}} faces. Growth on other forms, including {\{}0112{\}}, {\{}1120{\}}, and {\{}0001{\}}, does not result in differential partitioning of trace elements and intrasectoral zoning, which is consistent with each of their surface symmetries and allowed growth mechanisms. However, sectoral zoning of Mg, Mn, and Sr occurs between these nonequivalent sectors, as well as {\{}1014{\}}. We present a model detailing the geometry and coordination of elementary kink sites to explain both the differential incorporation and the rate anisotropy between nonequivalent growth steps on individual {\{}1014{\}} faces. The model, constrained by face symmetry, accounts for affinities of different trace elements among four structurally distinct kink sites at which incorporation is preferred. The model also explains the observed differences in growth step velocity, as well as the in situ observations of growth step velocities by atomic force microscopy. Trace element incorporation on the dominant {\{}1014{\}} faces of calcite is controlled by the detailed structure of the interface, which varies spatially on a face, as well as with external conditions. Consequently, our observed trace element distributions violate equilibrium partitioning, and it is likely that many trace element distributions in natural carbonates also may not reflect equilibrium. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Because strontium and magnesium occur in seawater with nearly constant ratios to calcium, variations in Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca in modern foraminifer shells are due to the influence of environmental parameters on calcification. We have cultured two species of planktonic foraminifera, Globigerina bulloides and Orbulina universa, to establish the influence of temperature, pH, and salinity. Experimental results indicate that temperature is the primary control on shell Mg/Ca and that shell Mg/Ca increases exponentially by about 8 to 10{\%} per ??C. The exponential rise in shell Mg with temperature mirrors the results from inorganic precipitation experiments and suggests at least partial thermodynamic control on Mg incroporation. Both seawater pH and salinity are secondary influences on shell Mg/Ca: -6{\%} per 0.1 pH unit increase and +4{\%} per salinity unit increase. Shell Sr/Ca responds far more weakly to environmental parameters, and the small range observed in shell Sr/Ca relative to measurement precision of the ICP-MS method used here limits how well controls on shell Sr can be determined. Higher temperature, salinity, and pH all appear to increase shell Sr/Ca, most likely through the kinetic influence of calcification. Our culturing results demonstrate the potential of Mg/Ca in G. bulloides as a paleothermometer. The culturing results suggest that the standard error of Mg paleothermometry is ??1.1??C, but when the secondary effects of salinity and pH are considered the error increases to ??1.3??C.},

Relative shifts in K-shell x-ray absorption spectra of aqueous cations and carboxylate anions indicate the corresponding binding strengths via perturbations of carbonyl antibonding orbitals. XAS spectra measured for aqueous formate and acetate solutions containing lithium, sodium, and potassium cations reveal monotonically stronger binding of the lighter metals, supporting recent results from simulations and other experiments. The carbon K-edge spectra of the acetate carbonyl feature centered near 290 eV clearly indicate a preferential interaction of sodium versus potassium, which was less apparent with formate. These results are in accord with the Law of Matching Water Affinities, relating relative hydration strengths of ions to their respective tendencies to form contact ion pairs. Density functional theory calculations of K-shell spectra support the experimental findings.},

The brachiopod valves consist of two principal layers of distinct calcite biomineralization: a thin, nanocrystalline, outer, hard protective layer with VMHI values exceeding 200 HV and a much thicker, inner, secondary layer of a hybrid organic-inorganic Þ ber composite material. The secondary layer is further structured into two sublayers, an outer part with VMHI values varying between 110 and 140 HV, and a softer inner part (70 {\textless} HV {\textless} 110). Whereas the size of the calcite crystals within the primary layer varies between a few tens of nanometers and 2 $\mu$m, calcite crystals within the secondary layer are Þ brous, commonly reaching lengths exceeding 150 $\mu$m. Cross sections of these Þ brous crystals are spade shaped, their dimensions being about 5 × 20 $\mu$m. The Þ bers are aligned parallel to each other. They are single crystals with their morphological Þ ber axes pointing almost parallel to the shell vault. The crystallographic orientation of the morphological Þ ber axes, however, is arbitrary within the a-b plane of the calcite lattice, whereas the c-axis (hexagonal unit-cell setting) is perpendicular to the morphological Þ ber axes and thus parallel to the radial vector of the valve vault. This morphology strongly indicates that Þ brous growth is controlled by conÞ nement within a cell in an organic matrix and not by attachment of biomolecules to speciÞ c crystallographic faces. We observe inhomogeneous Sr2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in the shell calcite within the 0.10.9 wt{\%} range. Design of the shell appears to be highly optimized for mechanical performance. Crystal morphology and orientation as well as incorporated organic matter are structured hierarchially at different length levels forming a hybrid organic-inorganic Þ ber composite architecture.},

From mid-Mesozoic time, the biologically catalyzed precipitation of calcium carbonates by pelagic phytoplankton has been primarily due to the production of calcite by coccolithophorids. In this paper we address the physical and chemical processes that select for coccolithophorid blooms detected in Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean color imagery. Our primary goal is to develop both diagnostic and prognostic models that represent the spatial and temporal dynamics of coccolithophorid blooms in order to improve our knowledge of the role of these organisms in mediating fluxes of carbon between the ocean, the atmosphere, and the lithosphere. On the basis of monthly composite images of classified coccolithophorid blooms and global climatological maps of physical variables and nutrient fields, we developed a probability density function that accounts for the physical chemical variables that predict the spatiotemporal distribution of coccolithophorids in the world oceans. Our analysis revealed that areas with sea surface temperatures (SST) between 3° and 15°C, a critical irradiance between 25 and 150 µmol quanta m-2 s-1, and decreasing nitrate concentrations (N/t {\textless} 0) are selective for upper ocean large-scale coccolithophorid blooms. While these conditions favor both Northern and Southern Hemisphere blooms of the most abundant coccolithophorid in the modern oceans, Emiliania huxleyi, the Northern and Southern Hemisphere populations of this organism are genetically distinct. Applying amplified fragment length polymorphism as a marker of genetic diversity, we identified two major taxonomic clades of E. huxleyi; one is associated with the Northern Hemisphere blooms, while the other is found in the Southern Hemisphere. We suggest a rule of “universal distribution and local selection”: that is, coccolithophorids can be considered cosmopolitan taxa, but their genetic plasticity provides physiological accommodation to local environmental selection pressure. Sea surface temperature, critical irradiance, and N/t were predicted for the years 2060–2070 using the NCAR Community Climate System Model to generate future monthly probability distributions of coccolithophorids based upon the relationships observed between the environmental variables and coccolithophorid blooms in modern oceans. Our projected probability distribution analysis suggests that in the North Atlantic, the largest habitat for coccolithophorids on Earth, the areal extent of blooms will decrease by up to 50{\%} by the middle of this century. We discuss how the magnitude of carbon fluxes may be affected by the evolutionary success of coccolithophorids in future climate scenarios.},

abstract = {Recently it has been observed that a strong quantitative relationship exists between asymptotic fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the deep ocean and asymptotic fluxes of "ballast" minerals (opal; calcium carbonate; dust). It has further been suggested that this relationship might provide a mechanistic basis for improved representations of remineralization in ocean carbon models. Since the depth scale of remineralization z* is the ratio k/v of a remineralization rate k and a settling velocity (SV) v, a mechanistic understanding of settling velocities will be crucial in developing such models. Historically, there have been two approaches to estimating the speed with which POC is transported to the deep ocean. First, settling speeds of single particles have been observed directly in both field and laboratory settings; estimates of fecal pellet sinking velocities tend to be higher and more variable than those of aggregates. Second, estimates have been made of the velocity at which temporal patterns in flux propagate between pairs of sediment traps separated in depth (the "benchmark approach"); recent studies have shown these results to be variable and to depend on mineral ballasting. Here we present SV estimates using a relatively new technology: indented rotating sphere (IRS) sediment traps run in settling velocity (SV) mode. In this approach, particles are separated into SV classes during settling to collection cups. In MedFlux, SV data were collected concurrently with time-series (TS) data; the latter were used to construct benchmark estimates for comparison to the SV estimates. From the SV data, the range of modal settling velocities (sinking velocities having the largest time-averaged mass flux densities on a logarithmic scale of SV) in the fast-sinking fraction was estimated to be 287-503 m/d; the average of these modal values is 353 m/d, with standard deviation 76 m/d. In contrast, mean settling velocities of the fast-sinking fraction depend on the range of settling velocity classes included in the estimate. If only SV classes settling at {\textgreater}50 m/d are included, the range of SVs at MedFlux was 214-298 m/d, with average mean value 242 m/d and standard deviation 31 m/d. These mean-velocity results are in excellent agreement with benchmark estimates of signal propagation velocities at Medflux (220??65 m/d); they are also well within the range of other recent benchmark studies. The agreement between the benchmark estimates and mean settling velocity estimates at MedFlux, but not with modal velocities, argues that the benchmark method estimates mean settling velocities. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Scanning electron microscope studies of the ultrastructures of foraminiferal tests suggest that 13C depleted specimens are affected by some 10-20{\%} overgrowth by authigenic calcite contributing to the light ?? 13C signal. Incremental-leaching experiments and census counts of pristine versus overgrowth-affected specimens show that the 13C depleted foraminiferal tests incorporate a primary ??13C signature most likely ranging from + 1??? to - 1.7??? and a post-depositional ??13C signature around - 17??? to - 19.5???. Extremely low values of productivity and organic carbon in Late Quaternary sediments along the east Greenland margin preclude organic matter as potential source of the isotopically light carbon. In contrast, thermal instability of clathrates and subsequent aerobic oxidation of (highly 12C enriched) methane in pore and ocean water provide a compelling mechanism to account for the negative ??13C excursions of both primary and post-depositional carbonates. Here, pore water methane may have led to a supersaturation of 13C depleted bicarbonate and precipitation of isotopically light authigenic calcite on and in foraminiferal tests, a feature that may serve as a tracer to former sites of clathrate destabilization. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To characterize the influence of ionic strength on the kinetics of calcite precipiation from seawater solutions we carried out a set of experiments at four different ionic strengths (I = 0.10; 0.34; 0.55; 0.93 m) in NaCl-CaCl2 solutions, at the temperature of 298.15K and a CO2 partial pressure of 100 Pa. The constant addition technique was used in order to maintain [Ca2+] at ???10.5 mmol/kg, while the [CO3
2-] was varied to isolate its role on the precipitation rate of calcite. Results of this study indicate that, when the ionic strength is increased from 0.10 to 0.93 m, the partial reaction order with respect to the CO3
2- concentration increases from 1 to 3 and the forward reaction rate constant, kf, increases by several orders of magnitude. This is interpreted as both a change in the calcite precipitation mechanism and a catalysis generated by the presence of inert electrolytes. Applying our model to the rate measurements carried out by Zhong and Mucci (1989) in seawater solutions at various salinities, under the compositional condition [Ca2+] ??? [CO3
2-], we find that partial reaction order with respect to the carbonate ion and the forward reaction rate constant increase as a function of the total ionic strength of the seawater solutions. A 50{\%} increase of the total ionic strength of the parent solution results in an increase of the precipitation rate by two orders of magnitude. Finally, we propose that ion interactions in solution and a concomitant change of the precipitation mechanism may contribute to the development of nonequivalent kink sites of different sizes on the surface of the growing crystal but which still satisfy the symmetry. Variations in the amount of foreign ions adsorbed and incorporated into marine calcites could, therefore, be determined by the density of these less constrained sites, which, in turn, would be dependent on the total ionic strength of the solution.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification resulting from human emissions of carbon dioxide has already lowered and will further lower surface ocean pH. The consequent decrease in calcium carbonate saturation potentially threatens calcareous marine organisms. Here, we demonstrate that the calcification rates of the edible mussel (Mytilus edulis) and Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) decline linearly with increasing pCO2. Mussel and oyster calcification may decrease by 25 and 10{\%}, respectively, by the end of the century, following the IPCC IS92a scenario (?740 ppmv in 2100). Moreover, mussels dissolve at pCO2 values exceeding a threshold value of ?1800 ppmv. As these two species are important ecosystem engineers in coastal ecosystems and represent a large part of worldwide aquaculture production, the predicted decrease of calcification in response to ocean acidification will probably have an impact on coastal biodiversity and ecosystem functioning as well as potentially lead to significant economic loss.

abstract = {[1] The Paleocene-Eocene Boundary (PEB) was marked by an extraordinary climatic event, hypothesized to originate from a large perturbation to the carbon cycle which fueled global warming, the rapid dissociation of oceanic methane hydrates. The pattern of surface warming interpreted from existing sea surface temperature records is not consistent with a greenhouse origin for this event, which would have fueled sea surface warming globally. Although oxygen isotope (delta(18)O)-based reconstructions indicate polar warming, results for the tropics and subtropics are ambiguous because of uncertainties associated with interpreting planktonic foraminiferal delta(18)O. To remedy this, we have constructed high-resolution temperature records based on Mg/Ca of multiple species of both surface and thermocline-dwelling planktonic foraminifera across the PEB in the equatorial Pacific and subtropical Atlantic. During the carbon isotope excursion (CIE), surface temperatures increased by 3.5degrees-4degreesC and thermocline temperatures warmed by 3 degreesC. Estimates of surface water and thermocline salinity based on paired Mg/Ca and delta(18)O data indicate a pattern of hydrographic changes in the equatorial and subtropical oceans that is different from previously proposed, with a more vigorous hydrologic cycle during warming. The pattern of warming and salinity changes are consistent with this being a greenhouse-induced global warming event, and the timing of hydrographic changes relative to the CIE supports the hypothesis that gradual warming of intermediate/ deep waters triggered methane hydrate dissociation.},

abstract = {Pearson and Palmer (1) concluded that even though middle Eocene (43 Ma) global mean temperature was perhaps 5°C warmer than today, " atmospheric pCO 2 was probably sim-ilar to modern concentrations or slightly higher. " They suggest " either that Earth's climate is very sensitive to small changes in pCO 2 , or that the global cooling since the Eocene was not driven primarily by changes in pCO 2 . . . . " This result has led some (2) to suggest that " the whole carbon dioxide para-digm is crumbling. " Pearson and Palmer used boron isotopes to infer paleo-ocean pH, and then used this paleo-pH proxy to estimate paleo-atmospher-ic pCO 2 under the assumption of constant concentration of total dissolved inorganic carbon in seawater. However, carbon is con-tinuously supplied to the atmosphere and ocean by degassing from metamorphism and magmatism and by the weathering of carbon-ate minerals and organic carbon, and is con-tinuously consumed by the production of car-bonate and organic carbon sediments (3). Hence, the total dissolved inorganic carbon load of the ocean could be expected to vary over time. The carbonate chemistry of seawater is largely controlled by the twin constraints of atmospheric pCO 2 and ocean carbonate-ion concentration (3). The mean partial pressure of CO 2 in the surface ocean is nearly equal to that of the atmosphere. Because the ocean is in contact with carbonate sediments, both on shelves and in the deep sea, the ocean as a first approximation is roughly saturated with respect to calcite. If we assume that the con-centration of Ca 2ϩ has remained nearly con-stant, this is equivalent to a roughly constant carbonate-ion concentration (CO 3 2Ϫ). Under this assumption we can predict pCO 2 as a function of the hydrogen-ion con-centration, or pH, using: pCO 2 ϭ K H [H ϩ ] 2 [CO 3 2Ϫ ]/K 1 K 2 , (1) where K H is the Henry's law constant for CO 2 , and K 1 and K 2 are the first and second dissociation constants for carbonic acid. Equation 1 scales with the square of the hydrogen-ion concentration, whereas the equation used by Pearson and Palmer roughly scales directly with the hydrogen-ion concen-tration (Fig. 1). Hence, the assumption of constant carbonate-ion concentration yields far greater pH sensitivity than does the as-sumption of constant total dissolved inorgan-ic carbon concentration. If we assume that the preindustrial surface ocean had a pH of 8.25, Eq. 1 yields a pCO 2 of ϳ2.5 times the preindustrial atmospheric value for the pH of 8.05 inferred by Pearson and Palmer for the Eocene surface ocean. If climate sensitivity to enhanced atmospheric CO 2 is 1.5° to 4.5°C per CO 2 -doubling (4), then this yields 2° to 6°C CO 2 -induced warm-ing for the Eocene, which suggests that en-hanced atmospheric CO 2 content could ex-plain much or all of inferred Eocene warmth. In this calculation we have assumed that the carbonate ion concentration is constant, and therefore a large variation in calcium carbon-ate saturation state in the surface ocean is not implied. However, the Eocene ocean overall was probably more acidic than at present, as suggested by a distinctly shallower carbonate compensation depth at that time (5), and this in itself suggests that the Eocene atmospheric CO 2 level was higher than it is today. Factors such as biological productivity could affect the surface-ocean carbonate ion concentra-tion and thereby affect the predicted pCO 2 in the surface ocean. Nevertheless, we have shown here that pH values inferred by Pear-son and Palmer are entirely consistent with large amounts of CO 2 in the Eocene atmo-sphere. Therefore, reports of the death of the carbon dioxide paradigm are exaggerated.},

abstract = {Understanding the partitioning of aqueous boron species into marine carbonates is critical for constraining the boron isotope system for use as a marine pH proxy. Previous studies have assumed that boron was incorporated into carbonate through the preferential uptake of tetrahedral borate B(OH)4-. In this study we revisit this assumption through a detailed solid state 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic study of boron speciation in biogenic and hydrothermal carbonates. Our new results contrast with those of the only previous NMR study of carbonates insofar as we observe both trigonal and tetrahedral coordinated boron in almost equal abundances in our biogenic calcite and aragonite samples. In addition, we observe no strict dependency of boron coordination on carbonate crystal structure. These NMR observations coupled with our earlier re-evaluation of the magnitude of boron isotope fractionation between aqueous species suggest that controls on boron isotope composition in marine carbonates, and hence the pH proxy, are more complex that previously suggested. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Sedimentary minerals are generally metastable phases that, given time and changing environmental conditions, recrystallize to more stable phases. The actual pathway of stabilization is governed by a host of kinetic factors. Unfortunately, much of the theoretical and experimental work on thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of sedimentary minerals either has not reached field practitioners in sedimentary petrology, or has been conducted under conditions that are difficult to extrapolate to natural sedimentary environments. In this paper we review and present new data on the basic crystal chemistry, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of calcite, dolomite, apatite, and biogenic silica, and discuss the relevance of these data to the solution of geological and geochemical problems. The crystal chemistry and structure of a given magnesian calcite exert a fundamental control on its solubility and solid solution behavior, and this control can be seen most clearly through comparison of synthetic and biogenic phases. Thus, variations in crystal chemistry and structure, through solubility control during diagenesis, yield a range of possible stabilization pathways, whose documentation is the domain of much field-based study. Experimental work involving dolomite has focused on delineation of phase relations in dry and aqueous systems at moderate to high temperatures, determination of reaction pathways followed during dolomitization of calcium carbonate, and measurement of reaction rate. Uncertainties reside in the relevance of these data to the classic problem of low-temperature dolomite formation. We suggest that the effort must now focus on designing experimental systems that effectively mimic natural environments, and yield reaction rate data as a function of temperature and solution composition. Such an example is presented. A primary goal in experimental work involving carbonate fluorapatite has been an understanding of the mechanism of formation of this mineral. We review the state of this knowledge, and also present the results of ongoing dissolution rate experiments. The importance of this work is that it bears directly on the understanding of the role carbonate fluorapatite plays in the biogeochemical cycle of P in the oceans. Many factors influence the solubilities of opaline silica and the silica polymorphs, and solubility plays an important role in controlling silica diagenesis. A model is presented that relates changes in sediment properties including density and acoustic velocity to the stages of silica diagenesis. The model is applied to sediments of Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 63. The discussions of the sedimentary phases calcite, dolomite, apatite, and biogenic silica in this paper point to several directions for future experimental research on sedimentary mineral-solution reactions. These include emphasis on: (1) experimental studies of synthetic sedimentary mineral-solution reactions to form a foundation for an understanding of natural mineral-solution reactions; (2) experimental investigations of mineral reactions in aqueous solutions under conditions of composition, temperature, and pressure similar to the natural conditions of mineral formation; and (3) studies of the surface (as opposed to bulk) properties of sedimentary minerals in aqueous solutions and their role in reactions governing precipitation and dissolution of sedimentary phases. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Seeded-batch crystallization experiments allowing study of the growth and aggregation of the Vaterite modification of calcium carbonate are reported. Results are reported for initial relative supersaturation (sigma = S - 1) values in the range 1.66 to 6.70, stirrer speeds in the range 400 and 1200 rpm, and at temperatures of 25 and 40degreesC It is found that in all cases the linear rate of growth of the particles is size independent and depends on relative supersaturation squared. The aggregation process is apparently size independent with a rate constant that is directly proportional to the instantaneous growth rate and decreases with increasing stirrer speed. The behavior of the aggregation rate constant is very well described by the model recently proposed by Liew et al., in which the efficiency of the aggregation process is predicted to depend only on the dimensionless strength of the particles and the nature of the flow field. It is concluded that Vaterite forms aggregates with crystalline bridges having an effective strength of approximately 25{\%} of that of calcite or calcium oxalate monohydrate. The fitted parameter Lsigma*/M-50 takes on a value of 0.18 +/- 0.02. The kinetics and associated model are capable of describing the evolving particle size distributions very well. Finally, a hypothesis is advanced to describe the aggregation, of small inorganic crystals in supersaturated solutions. (C) 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.},

abstract = {The stable isotope and minor element geochemistry of Neocomian (Lower Cretaceous) pelagic carbonates of the North Atlantic Basin (Deep Sea Drilling Project Sites 105, 367, 387, 391, and 603) was examined to develop a diagenetic model for pelagic limestones, In particular, we hoped to test the fidelity of whole-rock geochemical records as paleoceanographic indicators for pelagic deposits of pre-Aptian age, in which individual microfossils are not available for analysis. Data indicate that in addition. to depth of burial, rhythmic variations in primary carbonate content have strongly controlled diagenetic patterns and associated geochemical signatures in these Neocomian sequences. Samples become. increasingly depleted in Sr and O-18 with increasing CaCO3 content. Within individual sedimentary sections, substantial decreases in Sr/Ca ratios and delta(18)O values are evident over a range of 4 to 98{\%} CaCO3. However, even over a relatively narrow range of 50 to 98{\%} CaCO3 a 2.5 parts per thousand variation in delta(18)O values and a change of a factor of 1.7 in Sr/Ca ratios are observed. Carbon isotope compositions do not vary as extensively with CaCO3 content, but carbonate-rich intervals tend to be relatively depleted in C-13. Petrographic analysis reveals that these geochemical patterns are related to the transfer of CaCO3 from carbonate-poor intervals (calcareous shales and marlstones) to adjacent carbonate-rich intervals (limestones) during burial compaction and pressure solution. This process results in the addition of diagenetic cement to carbonate-rich intervals to produce a bulk composition that is relatively depleted in Sr and O-18 and, at the same time, enables the retention of more-or-less primary carbonate that is relatively enriched in Sr and O-18 in adjacent carbonate-poor intervals. Thus, although cyclic variations in CaCO3 content are primary in the Neocomian sequences examined, measured variations in Sr/Ca ratios and delta(18)O values are not and, as such, do not provide reliable proxies for past variations in climate, oceanographic conditions, or global ice volume.},

abstract = {This is the 29th annual review of the application of atomic spectrometry to the chemical analysis of environmental samples. This Update refers to papers published approximately between September 2012 and July 2013 and continues the series of Atomic Spectrometry Updates (ASUs) in Environmental Analysis 1 that should be read in conjunction with other related ASUs in the series namely: clinical and biological materials, foods and beverages; 2 advances in atomic spectrometry and related techniques;3 elemental speciation;3 X-ray spectrometry4 and advances in the analysis of metals, chemicals and materials.5 In the field of air analysis, highlights within this review period include measuring the bioaccessible fraction of metals in particles and ongoing work in assessing the performance of optical and combustion techniques for the determination of the carbonaceous content of airborne particulate matter. Developments in instrumentation included new sampler designs for the collection of nanoparticles, the coupling of FFF and hydrodynamic chromatography to ICP-MS for the sizing and compositional analysis of such particles and the ongoing development of aerosol mass spectrometry. In the field of water analysis, new procedures for the detection and quantification of emerging pollutants in water such as MRI contrast agents have been developed. Instrumental developments reported include the use of molecular absorption spectrometry, by exploiting the CS-AAS technique, for measuring halogen species in water. Numerous articles involving the application of atomic spectrometry to plants, soils and related materials appeared in this review period but, as usual, most were concerned with the environmental significance of the results, rather than the methodology used to obtain them. Nevertheless, there have been some interesting developments. Both LIBS and PXRF spectrometry have been used more widely, variants such as LA-LIBS and microwave assisted LIBS have appeared, and PXRF spectrometry has been applied for the first time in the analysis of plants. Developments in geochemical analysis include the production and (re)certification of new geological RMs for bulk, isotopic and microspatial analysis. Optimisation of LA-ICP-MS techniques for the interrogation of geochemical samples continues to be reported and a number of useful instrumental review articles (AMS, ICP-MS and SIMS) have been published.

abstract = {The only physical evidence from the earliest phases of Earth's evolution comes from zircons, ancient mineral grains that can be dated using the U–Th–Pb geochronometer1. Oxygen isotope ratios from such zircons have been used to infer when the hydrosphere and conditions habitable to life were established2,3. Chemical homogenization of Earth's crust and the existence of a magma ocean have not been dated directly, but must have occurred earlier4. However, the accuracy of the U–Pb zircon ages can plausibly be biased by poorly understood processes of intracrystalline Pb mobility5–7 . Here we use atom- probe tomography8 to identify and map individual atoms in the oldest concordant grain from Earth, a 4.4-Gyr-old Hadean zircon with a high-temperature overgrowth that formed about 1 Gyr after the mineral's core. Isolated nanoclusters, measuring about 10 nm and spaced 10–50 nm apart, are enriched in incompatible elements including radiogenic Pb with unusually high 207 Pb/206 Pb ratios. We demonstrate that the length scales of these clusters make U–Pb age biasing impossible, and that they formed during the later reheating event. Our tomography data thereby confirm that any mixing event of the silicate Earth must have occurred before 4.4 Gyr ago, consistent with magma ocean formation by an early moon-forming impact4 about 4.5 Gyr ago.},

abstract = {Several biomineralization proteins that exhibit intrinsic disorder also possess sequence regions that are homologous to nonmineral associated folded proteins. One such protein is the amorphous calcium carbonate binding protein (ACCBP), one of several proteins that regulate the formation of the oyster shell and exhibit 30{\%} conserved sequence identity to the acetylcholine binding protein sequences. To gain a better understanding of the ACCBP protein, we utilized bioinformatic approaches to identify the location of disordered and folded regions within this protein. In addition, we synthesized a 50 AA polypeptide, ACCN, representing the N-terminal domain of the mature processed ACCBP protein. We then utilized this polypeptide to determine the mineralization activity and qualitative structure of the N-terminal region of ACCBP. Our bioinformatic studies indicate that ACCBP consists of a ten-stranded beta-sandwich structure that includes short disordered sequence blocks, two of which reside within the primarily helical and surface-accessible ACCN sequence. Circular dichroism studies reveal that ACCN is partially disordered in solution; however, ACCN can be induced to fold into an alpha helix in the presence of TFE. Furthermore, we confirm that the ACCN sequence is multifunctional; this sequence promotes radial calcite polycrystal growth on Kevlar threads and forms supramolecular assemblies in solution that contain amorphous-appearing deposits. We conclude that the partially disordered ACCN sequence is a putative site for mineralization activity within the ACCBP protein and that the presence of short disordered sequence regions within the ACCBP fold are essential for function.},

The soluble acidic macromolecules associated with biominerals are thought to play an important role in modulating the mineral morphology. Our in vitro studies, which use acidic polypeptide additives to modify crystal growth of calcium-based minerals, have demonstrated a crystallization mechanism that proceeds via a liquid-phase mineral precursor. Various features of the crystals produced via this mechanism, such as "extruded" mineral fibers and mineralized collagen composites, have led us to propose the hypothesis that an amorphous, liquid-phase precursor could play a fundamental role in the morphogenesis of calcium-based biominerals. Although in vivo evidence of this process remains to be determined, we demonstrate crystallization features that mimic bone and dental enamel and suggest that this process could be relevant to biomineralization in both vertebrates and invertebrates.},

abstract = {We present a simplified method for solving the local equilibrium carbonate chemistry in numerical ocean biogeochemistry models. Compared to the methods typically used, the scheme is fast, efficient and compact. The accuracy of the solution is dictated by the number of species retained in the expression for alkalinity and there is almost no computational penalty for retaining minor contributions. We demonstrate that this scheme accurately reproduces the results of the commonly used method in the context of a three-dimensional global ocean carbon cycle model. Using this model we also show that neglecting the regional variations in surface dissolved inorganic phosphorus and silicic acid concentrations can lead to significant systematic bias in regional estimates of air-sea carbon fluxes using such models. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The first analyses of modern and fossil corals (calcite-free) using a positive ion (Cs2BO2
+) TIMS technique and a chemical procedure for B extraction are reported. The ??11B for modern corals fluctuates between 23.3 and 25.5???. The range of variation of fossil corals from the last interglacial period is greater, from 23.5 to 27.3???, and the lowest ??11B corresponds to the corals close to Last Glacial Maximum. Boron concentrations show a variation from 49 to 58 ppm in the recent corals, and from 39 to 52 ppm in ancient corals. For the ancient corals, linear correlations are observed in both ??11B vs. B concentration and ??11B vs. 1 B plots, but these correlations are not observed for modern corals. Two interpretations are presented to account for these observations and to test the potential of ??11B for reconstructing paleo-ocean pH. The first interpretation assumes a thermodynamic partitioning of B between seawater and carbonates and shows that both boron isotopic compositions and concentrations can be used to calculate the pH of seawater in which corals grow. For our data, such a model requires that both the pH and the ??CO2 of the deglacial ocean was lower than present-day values. The second interpretation is based on the correlation observed for ancient corals between boron isotopic compositions and 1 B. We suggest that the measured boron isotopic compositions of ancient corals are caused by the mixing of a primary aragonite (the coral skeleton) and secondary aragonite precipitated from 10B-enriched reef pore fluids. The characteristics (??11B and B concentrations) of the diagenetic aragonite and the fluids from which it precipitates can be constrained. If this proves correct, only the non-recrystallised parts of ancient corals can be used for paleo-pH reconstructions. These recrystallisation processes did not affect the 234U238U ratios of the corals. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {The effects of the trace metals zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and cadmium (Cd) on the metabolism of growth plate chondrocytes was examined using a mineralizing culture system. Supplementation of serum-free primary cultures of growth plate chondrocytes with 10-100 mu m Zn resulted in an increase in cell protein and greatly increased alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity; however, above 25 mu m Zn mineralization of the cultures was reduced. The effects of Zn on cellular protein and AP activity were enhanced by the addition of the albumin to the culture media. Removal of Zn from basal culture media resulted in recoverable reductions in cellular protein and AP activities. Cadmium was acutely toxic to chondrocyte cell cultures at concentrations above 5 mu m. Even at very low concentrations (0.25 mu m) Cd caused significant reductions in DNA, cellular protein, and matrix protein synthesis. In contrast, Cd had negligible effects on AP activity or culture mineralization. Manganese treatment (50 mu m) resulted in reduced levels of proteoglycan, cell protein, DNA synthesis, and collagen synthesis, although AP specific activity did not change. At 10 mu m, Mn significantly reduced mineralization but had only minor influence on other culture parameters. Both Zn (200 mu m) and Cd (0.1 mu m), but not Mn, induced the synthesis of metallothionein. The physiological and biochemical effects of specific metal ions is largely dependent on their physicochemical properties, especially their ligand affinities. Knowledge of these properties allows predictions to be made regarding whether the organic or the mineral phase are most likely to be affected in a mineralized tissue.},

abstract = {Although the emergence of complex biomineralized forms has been investigated for over a century, still little is known on how single cells control morphology of skeletal structures, such as frustules, shells, spicules, or scales. We have run experiments on the shell formation in foraminifera, unicellular, mainly marine organisms that can build shells by successive additions of chambers. We used live imaging to discover that all stages of chamber/shell formation are controlled by dedicated actin-driven pseudopodial structures. Successive reorganization of an F-actin meshwork, associated with microtubular structures, is actively involved in formation of protective envelope, followed by dynamic scaffolding of chamber morphology. Then lamellar dynamic templates create a confined space and control mineralization separated from seawater. These observations exclude extracellular calcification assumed in selected foraminiferal clades, and instead suggest a semiintracellular biomineralization pattern known from other unicellular calcifying and silicifying organisms. These results give a challenging prospect to decipher the vital effect on geochemical proxies applied to paleoceanographic reconstructions. They have further implications for understanding multiscale complexity of biomineralization and show a prospect for material science applications.},

abstract = {-Scanning Force Microscopv (SFM) was used to observe near-equilibrium calcite growth pro-cesses in solutions of known imposition and {\~{}}turation state. Calcite seeds were reacted in solutions of known saturation state at 25°C and 0.96 atm P co2 for 1-2 days before transferring to a SFM fluid cell for observations of continued growth in the same solutions. We observed that when solution saturations with respect to calcite were greater than l-2, precipitation began with the formation of surface nuclei. These nuclei spread, coalesced, and continued growing. Only after nearly two hours was there a transition to a mechanism resembfing spiral growth. At these long reaction times, migrating steps assumed individual heights of l-2 monolayers. We aIso observed simul-taneous growth and dissolution at unde{\~{}}aturated con{\~{}}tions very near equilib{\~{}}um. The influence of phospha{\~{}} was also examined and obligations suggested two inhibition mechanisms, depending on surface history. Phosphate (6 and 10 gmol PQ) introduced during the nucleation stage results in the formation of nuclei with amorphous shapes. Phosphate introduced during Iayer growth disrupts the relatively straight steps produced during PO.,-free growth to form jagged steps. Both of the phosphate-calcite surface interactions are consistent with mechanisms proposed in previous studies. Our findings suggest that when solution saturations with respect to calcite are greater than two, pre-cipitation always begins with the fo{\~{}}at{\~{}}on of surface nuclei with a Iater t{\~{}}nsition to mononuclear growth mechanisms. These observations have implications for carbonate precipitation in natural systems and suggest that calcite growth in environments with frequent wetting and drying cycles begin each wetting event with precipitation by surface nudeation. Results of this study also suggest that experimental investigations of calcite precipitation kinetics and interpretations of growth mechanisms must account for this earIy stage contribution by nucleation. Otherwise, such rates of calcite growth may not reflect the overall slower rates that occur in continuously wet environments.},

abstract = {The achievements of the MAST II funded EHUX project, an interdisciplinary study of the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi are briefly reviewed. A collection of over 300 clones of E. huxleyi has been maintained to support research on coccolithophorid morphology, physiology, molecular genetics, and the life cycle. Laboratory cultures have also been used for investigations of calcification and calcification gene identification. The photobiology of E. huxleyi, interactions between productivity and the environment, and coccolithophorid growth and production have been studied both in the laboratory and in the Northern North Sea, the latter work being guided by remote sensing. Integrated investigations have been made of the synthesis and degradation of lipid biomarkers produced by E. huxleyi, the formation and microbial degradation of aggregates, and zooplankton grazing and mortality. An extensive programme of mesocosm studies has been carried out with special emphasis on the population dynamics of E. huxleyi, the coupling between calcification and nutrient supply, and the role of viruses in population dynamics. Mathematical simulation models of mesocosm bloom dynamics have been developed, first attempts have been made to develop cell biological models of E. huxleyi, and a model which predicts the timing and magnitudes of blooms of E. huxleyi with particular reference to the seasonal succession in the North Atlantic has been developed.},

abstract = {Calcareous foraminifera are well known for their CaCO 3 shells. Yet, CaCO 3 precipitation acidifies the calcifying fluid. Calcification without pH regulation would therefore rapidly create a negative feedback for CaCO 3 precipitation. In unicellular organisms, like foraminifera, an effective mechanism to counteract this acidification could be the externalization of H + from the site of calcification. In this study we show that a benthic symbiont-free foraminifer Ammonia sp. actively decreases pH within its extracellular microenvironment only while precipitating calcite. During chamber formation events the strongest pH decreases occurred in the vicinity of a newly forming chamber (range of gradient {\~{}}100??m) with a recorded minimum of 6.31 ({\textless}10??m from the shell) and a maximum duration of 7h. The acidification was actively regulated by the foraminifera and correlated with shell diameters, indicating that the amount of protons removed during calcification is directly related to the volume of calcite precipitated. The here presented findings imply that H + expulsion as a result of calcification may be a wider strategy for maintaining pH homeostasis in unicellular calcifying organisms. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Several enhancements were added to improve the performance of the algorithm over a traditional GA. The edge map is split into connected subregions to reduce the solution space and simplify the problem. The edge-map is then optimized in parallel using incorporated genetic operators that perform transforms on edge structures. Adaptation is used to control operator probabilities based on their participation. The GA was compared to the simulated annealing (SA) approach using ideal and actual medical images from different modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound. Quantitative comparisons were provided based on the Pratt figure of merit and on the cost-function minimization. The detected edges were thin, continuous, and well localized. Most of the basic edge features were detected. Results for different medical image modalities are promising and encourage further investigation to improve the accuracy and experiment with different cost functions and genetic operators.},

N66 is composed of carbonic anhydrase-like and repeat domains, as described for nacrein (1) in the pearls of P. fucata. N14 is homologous to N16, recently found in the nacreous layer of P. fucata (2) and is characterized by high proportions of Gly, Tyr, and Asn together with NG repeat sequences. The molecular weights of these proteins were estimated as 59,814 and 13,734 Da, respectively. Structural differences were clearly indicated in the alignment and length of the repeat sequences of the sets of the homogeneous proteins (N66/nacrein and N14/N16). The longer repeat sequences of N66 and N14 may be responsible for P. maxima's excellent property of calcification. The in vitro crystallization experiments revealed that the mixture of N66 and N14 could induce platy aragonite layers highly similar to the nacreous layer, once adsorbed onto the membrane of the water-insoluble matrix.},

We assess the fidelity of shell-derived ??18Oseawater estimates for the surface-dwelling foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white) using an Atlantic meridional coretop transect spanning basin-scale temperature and salinity gradients. Shell-derived and observed ??18Oseawater values are well correlated (r2=0.77), but a large systematic bias is observed. Shell Mg/Ca ratios are significantly elevated above values expected from observed and isotopic calcification temperatures in the saline subtropical gyres of both hemispheres. This temperature-independent shell Mg/Ca ratio variability, termed "excess Mg/Ca", is highly correlated with surface salinity (r2=0.77), and the observed salinity dependence (27??4{\%}) is much higher than indicated by culture studies (6??2{\%}). Our coretop data are used to develop new Atlantic Basin temperature and salinity calibration equations that are accurate (??1.1??C and ??0.20, respectively), precise (r2=0.82 and 0.81, respectively), and verifiable using previously published data. These results are valid for the relatively high salinities of the subtropical Atlantic (35.5-37.3). We discover that inclusion of other published data from lower salinity regions ({\textless}35) indicates little or no excess Mg/Ca. Taken together, these results point to a strongly non-linear, positive salinity effect on shell Mg/Ca ratios that significantly affects the accuracy of SST and ??18Oseawater estimates in high salinity settings ({\textgreater}35). ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {On-board bottle incubation experiments were carried out by adding different amounts of iron as part of the SEEDS (Subarctic Pacific Iron Experiment for Ecosystem Dynamics Study) experiment to elucidate the phytoplankton community response to various iron concentrations. A temperature gradient from 5 to 18??C was also applied to the incubation experiment because temperature also affects growth rate and metabolic functions such as enzyme reactions. Chlorophyll-a increased with increasing iron concentration, while the increase in chlorophyll-a in the control bottles (no iron addition) was nominal. Size-fractionated chlorophyll-a indicated that micro-phytoplankton ({\textgreater}10 ??m) became dominant in the iron-enriched bottles below 13??C, which was consistent with the results from in situ observations in the simultaneous mesoscale iron-enrichment experiment and similar experiments for the other high nitrate and low chlorophyll (HNLC) waters. Macronutrients (silicate, nitrate and phosphate) were consumed in the bottles below 13??C. The consumption ratio of silicate to nitrate was around 1:1 for iron-enriched bottles, but this ratio was slightly higher for control bottles, indicating a physiological stress due to low iron concentration on the diatoms. In contrast, nanophytoplankton ({\textless}10 ??m) were dominant in the iron-enriched bottles at 18??C. There was no silicate utilization, but nitrate and phosphate were consumed in these bottles. Bacillariophyceae were dominant in the bottles below 13??C, but Prymnesiophyceae became dominant at 18??C. This is the first report demonstrating that temperature influences phytoplankton composition after iron addition in HNLC waters. The Chlorophyll-a specific increase rate for micro-plankton ({\textgreater}10 ??m) doubled from 5 to 8??C and was the highest between 8 and 13??C at the same iron concentration. The surface mixed layer temperature was 8??C at the beginning of iron fertilization, but it had been 5??C just 2 weeks before the experiment. This dramatic increase in growth rate with temperature is hypothesized to be the reason for SEEDS 2001 biomass changes being the highest reported response to a mesoscale Fe-enrichment experiment in HNLC waters. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In anti-malaria operations the use of DDT for indoor residual spraying has declined substantially over the past 30 years, but this insecticide is still considered valuable for malaria control, mainly because of its low cost relative to alternative insecticides. Despite the development of resistance to DDT in some populations of malaria vector Anopheles mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), DDT remains generally effective when used for house-spraying against most species of Anopheles, due to excitorepellency as well as insecticidal effects. A 1990 cost comparison by the World Health Organization (WHO) found DDT to be considerably less expensive than other insecticides, which cost 2 to 23 times more on the basis of cost per house per 6 months of control. To determine whether such a cost advantage still prevails for DDT, this paper compares recent price quotes from manufacturers and WHO suppliers for DDT and appropriate formulations of nine other insecticides (two carbamates, two organophosphates and {\textregistered}ve pyrethroids) commonly used for residual house-spraying in malaria control programmes. Based on these `global' price quotes, detailed calculations show that DDT is still the least expensive insecticide on a cost per house basis, although the price appears to be rising as DDT production declines. At the same time, the prices of pyrethroids are declining, making some only slightly more expensive than DDT at low application dosages. Other costs, including operations (labour), transportation and human safety may also increase the price advantages of DDT and some pyrethroids vs. organophosphates and carbamates, although possible environmental impacts from DDT remain a concern. However, a global cost comparison may not realistically re¯ect local costs or effective application dosages at the country level. Recent data on insecticide prices paid by the health ministries of individual countries showed that prices of particular insecticides can vary substantially in the open market. Therefore, the most costeffective insecticide in any given country or region must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Regional coordination of procurement of public health insecticides could improve access to affordable products.},

Here this technique is used to examine Mg isotopic variation among different species of core top foraminifera over a range of different ambient conditions. Despite the high degree of temperature control on the abundance of elemental Mg incorporated into foraminiferal tests, analyses of surface dwelling Globigerinoides ruber and G. sacculifer from five cores, with associated sea surface temperatures ranging from 20 to 31癈, show no significant temperature-dependent variations in their Mg isotope ratios. Analyses of different size fractions of G. sacculifer show an increase in Mg/Ca with test size but no variation of Mg isotope ratio. In all, nine planktic and benthic species were analyzed; all show identical Mg isotope ratios with a mean of {\&}{\#}948; 26Mg = {\&}{\#}8722;4.72{\&}{\#}8240;, apart from small differences in three species, namely O. universa, G. sacculifer (which are both {\&}{\#}8764;0.4{\&}{\#}8240; lighter than the average), and P. obliquiloculata (which is {\&}{\#}8764;0.4{\&}{\#}8240; heavier). These results highlight the constancy of foraminiferal Mg isotope ratios, despite changing environmental conditions which dominate Mg/Ca variation and arguably affect Ca isotope fractionation. This is an important observation which needs to be included in any model of foraminiferal calcification. The insusceptibility of {\&}{\#}948; 26Mg values to external parameters makes Mg isotopes ideally suited to constraining past variations in the Mg isotope budget of the oceans and the information this carries about the history of oceanic dolomitization, continental weathering, and hydrothermal behavior.},

This is substantially smaller than earlier estimates of 0.25 on which a majority of ocean biogeochemical models had based their parameterization of CaCO3 production. Contrary to the pattern of coccolithophore blooms determined from satellite observations, which show high latitude predominance, we find maximum export ratios in the equatorial region and generally smaller ratios in the subtropical and subpolar gyres. Our results suggest a dominant contribution to global calcification by low-latitude nonbloom forming coccolithophores or other organisms such as foraminifera and pteropods. INDEX},

abstract = {The kinetics of dissolution of vaterite (CaCO3) crystals in aqueous potassium chloride solutions were studied at temperatures between 15 and 45 degrees C and ionic strengths between 50 and 200 mol/L. The vaterite preparate used consisted of spherulites of vaterite crystals with initial radii of 2.7 to 4.6 mu m. The progress of the dissolution was followed by recording pH as a function of time. From pH the concentration of the dissolved matter was calculated, and from this we found the particle size, r, and the dissolution rate, -dr/dt, where r = average particle radius and t = time. Straight lines were obtained by plotting -r(dr/dt) as a function of undersaturation, c(S)-c, which may be explained by diffusional rate control. Both the values of the apparent diffusion coefficients determined and their dependence on temperature (activation energy = 24.38 kJ/mol) support the assumption that the rate-determining process for the dissolution is the diffusion of the hydrated calcium and carbonate ions away from the crystal surface into the bulk solution.},

abstract = {The resilience of tropical corals to ocean acidification depends on their ability to regulate the pH within their calcifying fluid (pH cf). Recent work suggests pH cf homeostasis under short-term exposure to pCO 2 conditions predicted for 2100, but it is still unclear if pH cf homeostasis can be maintained throughout a corals lifetime. At CO 2 seeps in Papua New Guinea, massive Porites corals have grown along a natural seawater pH gradient for decades. This natural gradient, ranging from pH 8.1–7.4, provides an ideal platform to determine corals' pH cf (using boron isotopes). Porites maintained a similar pH cf ({\~{}}8.24) at both a control (pH 8.1) and seep-influenced site (pH 7.9). Internal pH cf was slightly reduced (8.12) at seawater pH 7.6, and decreased to 7.94 at a site with a seawater pH of 7.4. A growth response model based on pH cf mirrors the observed distribution patterns of this species in the field. We suggest Porites has the capacity to acclimate after long-time exposure to end-of-century reduced seawater pH conditions and that strong control over pH cf represents a key mechanism to persist in future oceans. Only beyond end-of-century pCO 2 conditions do they face their current physiological limit of pH homeostasis and pH cf begins to decrease. Tropical corals are the foundation species for coral reefs, the most diverse marine ecosystems in the world. The persistence of a species-rich reef-associated community will depend on the ability of corals to maintain net growth under future pCO 2 conditions. To date our understanding of the fate of corals in the face of ocean acidification is based on controlled laboratory studies 1,2},

The data imply that the stability within the water column during slack water periods, permits surface aggregation of dinoflagellates which become homogeneously distributed when turbulence intensifies during ebb and flood currents. Diatoms, conversely, rely on the periods of increased turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) to ensure entrainment into the upper water column and to prevent sinking from the photic zone during stable intervals. The unusual tidal regime for this estuary provides a unique environment to investigate the hydrodynamic properties which influence different phytoplankton groups.},

abstract = {[1] Optimal use of Mg/Ca as a paleotemperature proxy requires establishing calibrations for different species of foraminifera and quantifying the influence of dissolution. To achieve this goal, we have measured Mg/Ca and delta(18)O in a series of tropircal and subtropical core tops, including four depth transects: the Ceara Rise, the Sierra Leone Rise, and the Rio Grande Plateau in the Atlantic, and the Ontong Java Plateau in the Pacific, focusing on spinose mixed layer dwelling species Globigerinoides ruber and Globigerinoides sacculifer, and nonspinose thermocline dwelling Neogloboquadrina dutertrei. Shell Mg/Ca in G. sacculifer is 5-15{\%} lower than in G. ruber, while N. dutertrei Mg/Ca is 49-55{\%} lower than in G. ruber. This statistically significant offset has allowed us to establish different calibrations for each species. Multilinear regression analysis was used to develop calibration equations that include a correction term for the dissolution effect on Mg/Ca in foraminiferal calcite. Presented in this paper are two sets of calibrations; one set using core depth as a dissolution correction and another using DeltaCO(3)(2-) as a dissolution parameter. The calibrations suggest that G. ruber is the most accurate recorder of surface temperature, while G. sacculifer records temperatures below the surface at 20-30 m. The depth habitat of N. dutertrei is more uncertain, owing to the wide range in habitat depths depending on hydrographic conditions, but on average, Mg/Ca and delta(18)O data suggest it is at similar to50 m. Of the three species, N. dutertrei is the most sensitive to dissolution (up to 23{\%} decrease in shell Mg/Ca per km), while G. sacculifer is the most resistant.},

abstract = {The various hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the absence of a spring bloom at OWS P in the North Pacific have been evaluated by means of a sensitivity analysis of two seasonal mixed layer ecosystem models. The main model consisted of six compartments (phytoplankton, herbivorous and carnivorous zooplankton, nitrate, ammonium and detritus) forced by climatological mixed layer depths, photosynthetically available radiation and deep nitrate concentrations. It was concluded that the absence of a spring bloom at OWS P can be attributed to the limiting effect of herbivore grazing. In contrast at OWS I the deeper winter mixed layer depths means that net phytoplankton production in winter is insufficient to allow herbivore populations to reach high enough levels to exert a limiting grazing pressure at the time of the spring bloom. The high levels of summer nitrate at OWS P are mainly due to the limitation of new production by grazing coupled with a supply of nitrate from below the mixed layer; ammonium limitation of nitrate uptake is a secondary factor. The simulations at OWS P showed that small variations in the parameter values had only a marginal effect on phytoplankton biomass and this might explain the low degree of inter-annual variability of phytoplankton at OWS P. The possible role that iron deficiency might play in limiting production is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {The intensification and expansion of modern agriculture is amongst the greatest current threats to worldwide biodiversity. Over the last quarter of the 20th century, dramatic declines in both range and abundance of many species associated with farmland have been reported in Europe, leading to growing concern over the sustainability of current intensive farming practices. Purportedly 'sustainable' farming systems such as organic farming are now seen by many as a potential solution to this continued loss of biodiversity and receive substantial support in the form of subsidy payments through EU and national government legislation. This paper assesses the impacts on biodiversity of organic farming, relative to conventional agriculture, through a review of comparative studies of the two systems, in order to determine whether it can deliver on the biodiversity benefits its proponents claim. It identifies a wide range of taxa, including birds and mammals, invertebrates and arable flora, that benefit from organic management through increases in abundance and/or species richness. It also highlights three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilisers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming, and that are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife. However, the review also draws attention to four key issues: (1) It remains unclear whether a 'holistic' whole-farm approach (i.e. organic) provides greater benefits to biodiversity than carefully targeted prescriptions applied to relatively small areas of cropped and/or non-cropped habitats within conventional agriculture (i.e. agri-environment schemes); (2) Many comparative studies encounter methodological problems, limiting their ability to draw quantitative conclusions; (3) Our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming in pastoral and upland agriculture is limited; (4) There remains a pressing need for longitudinal, system-level studies in order to address these issues and to fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming, before a full appraisal of its potential role in biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems can be made. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We show here that the novel receptor kinase CORYNE (CRN) and CLV2 act together, and in parallel with CLV1, to perceive the CLV3 signal. Mutations in CRN cause stem cell proliferation, similar to clv1, clv2, and clv3 mutants. CRN has additional functions during plant development, including floral organ development, that are shared with CLV2. The CRN protein lacks a distinct extracellular domain, and we propose that CRN and CLV2 interact via their transmembrane domains to establish a functional receptor.},

Fundamental parameters profile fitting (FPPF) has been used to synthesize and fit data from both parallel beam and divergent beam diffractometers. The refined parame- ters are determined by the diffractometer configuration. In a divergent beam diffrac- tometer these include the angular aperture of the divergence slit, the width and axial length of the receiving slit, the angular apertures of the axial Soller slits, the length and projected width of the x-ray source, the absorption coefficient and axial length of the sample. In a parallel beam system the principal parameters are the angular aperture of the equatorial analyser/Soller slits and the angular aper- tures of the axial Soller slits. The presence of a monochromator in the beam path is normally accommodated by modifying the wavelength spectrum and/or by changing one or more of the axial divergence parameters. Flat analyzer crystals have been incorporated into FPPF as a Lorentzian shaped angular acceptance function. One of the intrinsic benefits of the fundamental parameters approach is its adaptability any laboratory diffractometer.

It is shown that, under certain conditions, pillars are transformed into walls or galleries or chambers, and that this transformation may not be driven by any change in the termites' behaviour. Because the same type of response at the individual level can generate different patterns under different conditions, and because previous construction modifies current building conditions, we hypothesize that nest complexity can result from the unfolding of a morphogenetic process that progressively generates a diversity of history-dependent structures.},

abstract = {In summary, the SIBLING family members that include DMP1, DSPP, MEPE, OPN, and BSP share common features such as their location on human chromosome 4q21; their multiple phosphorylation sites, making them highly acidic in nature; and the presence of an RGD integrin-binding domain. Each of these proteins plays an important role in either promoting tissue mineralization or inhibiting the calcification process. A general paradigm that emerges is that macromolecules such as DMP1, DPP in solution can act as an inhibitor of crystal nucleation and growth or can act as a template for crystal nucleation when it becomes adsorbed on a solid surface. Nucleation processes usually present an activation energy barrier before allowing the formation of a solid phase from a supersaturated metastable solution. In biological microenvironments, the activation energy for nucleation can be reduced by lowering of the interfacial energy. DPP immobilized on a collagen surface can lower the interfacial energy for HAP nucleation, indicating that DPP bound on collagen template had a high capacity to nucleate HAP. Similar lowering of interfacial energy can be anticipated with other phosphorylated proteins. This might be a common theme for proteins containing highly anionic polyanions. Both BSP and OPN possess high affinity for calcium due to the abundance of acidic amino acids such as glutamic and aspartic acid. Acidic amino acids in OPN phosphopeptides appear to contribute to the HAP-inhibiting activity by producing an electrostatic repulsion of inorganic phosphate ions once the protein is adsorbed to the crystal surface. Even during the inhibition process, it is necessary that these proteins bind to specific crystal faces. However, BSP promotes HAP nucleation when immobilized on a surface. Thus, the various acidic phosphoproteins of the extracellular matrix appear to have different crystal growth regulatory activities, enabling them to present specific distinct biological activities. Cooperation of several of these proteins would effectively promote or retard crystallization, as well as regulate the growth kinetics and size of crystals. Gene knockout models 97,189,262-265 of the proteins localized on 4q21 revealed that mineralized tissue formation and growth can be compensated by other macromolecules either partially or completely as well as by other members of the SIBLING family. In vivo studies of the effects of gene knockouts of individual SIBLINGs show that they each do more than simply alter the mineralization process. They also have profound effects on development and tissue repair not directly related to mineralization, as indicated below. Targeted deletion of MEPE gene resulted in increased bone mass. This was attributed to the increased osteoblast number and mineral apposition rate. Thus, in vivo MEPE could function as a negative regulator of osteoblast number and activity. Similarly, targeted disruption of OPN gene resulted in increased mineral content and maturity in long bones. Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FT-IRM) based characterization of the mineral in bones revealed that the relative amount of mineral in the more mature areas of the bone obtained from 12- and 16-week-old OPN-null mice was significantly increased. Moreover, mineral maturity (mineral crystal size and perfection) was prominent in OPN-deficient bone. These findings are in good agreement with in vitro data, indicating that OPN is a potent inhibitor of mineral formation and mineral crystal growth and proliferation. DMP1-null newborn mice display no gross abnormalities in mineralization, indicating that there must be redundant genes that compensate for DMP1 function during early development. During postnatal development, DMP1-null pups develop skeletal abnormalities like enlarged growth plate, osteomalacia, and development of short limbs. These defects have been proposed to be related to defective maturation of osteoblasts into osteocytes. The dentin phenotype in the null-mice shows a partial failure of maturation of predentin into dentin, increased wi th of the predentin zone with a reduced dentin wall hypomineralization, and a 3-fold reduction in dentin appositional rate. As the DSPP gene is abundantly synthesized by the odontoblasts, the tooth phenotype has been well-characterized. Overall, the DSPP-null mice develop tooth defects similar to human dentinogenesis imperfecta III with enlarged pulp chambers, increased width of predentin zone, hypomineralization, and pulp exposure. Electron microscopy revealed an irregular mineralization front and a lack of calcospherites coalescence in the dentin. Interestingly, the levels of biglycan and decorin, small leucine-rich proteoglycans, were increased in the widened predentin zone and in void spaces among the calcospherites in the dentin of null teeth. Thus, the protein products of the DSPP gene are required for proper dentin mineralization. BSP null mice are viable and breed normally. Bone is undermineralized. in fetuses and young adults, but not in older ({\textgreater}12 months) BSP-/- mice. At 4 months, BSP-/- mice display thinner cortical bones than wild type but greater trabecular bone volume with very low bone formation rate. Overall, BSP deficiency impairs bone growth and mineralization. These examples of in vivo consequences of gene ablation demonstrate both the wide range of system redundancies and the multiplicity of properties altered, which is evidence of the vital importance of controlled mineralization and the other effects of the SIBLINGs in both mechanical and metabolic functions. ?2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We investigated the phenomenon of activity cycles in ants, taking into account the spatial structure of colonies. In our study species, Leptothorax acervorum, there are two spatially segregated groups in the nest. We developed a model that considers the two groups as coupled oscillators which can produce synchronized activity. By investigating the effects of noise on the model system we predicted how the return of foragers affects activity cycles in ant colonies. We tested these predictions empirically by comparing the activity of colonies under two conditions: when foragers are and are not allowed to return to the nest. The activity of the whole colony and of each group within the colony was studied using image analysis. This allowed us to reveal the spatial pattern of activity wave propagation in ant colonies for the first time.},

There is little uniformity in the conditions used in these cultures, and where there is uniformity the chemical basis for the reagents used is sometimes questionable. Moreover, while it is well established that histochemical staining is a poor substitute for physicochemical assays of the nature of the mineral formed 9, the majority of both recent and classical papers in the literature rely on histochemistry to report the presence of bone- or toothlike mineral. The goal of this review is to place cell culture methodologies in a chemical context, to review the different types of cell culture systems that have been used to study the deposition of mineral in bones and teeth, discuss their limitations, and suggest some guidelines for future studies.},

Because interaction frequency is easier to estimate than per-interaction effect, using interaction frequency as a surrogate of total effect could facilitate the large-scale analysis of quantitative patterns of species-rich interaction networks. We show mathematically that the correlation between interaction frequency (I) and total effect (T) becomes more strongly positive the greater the variation of I relative to the variation of per-interaction effect (P) and the greater the correlation between I and P. A meta-analysis using data on I, P and T for animal pollinators and seed dispersers visiting plants shows a generally strong, positive relationship between T and I, in spite of no general relationship between P and I. Thus, frequent animal mutualists usually contribute the most to plant reproduction, regardless of their effectiveness on a per-interaction basis.},

abstract = {With the final goal to elucidate boron isotope fractionation observed experimentally, molecule orbital calculations were performed on boric acid and borate monomers and dimers. The geometries of B(OH)3 and B(OH)4- were first optimized and their vibrational frequencies were calculated at their optimized structures. The estimated 11B to 10B isotopic reduced partition function ratios (RPFRs) of the species and the calculated equilibrium constant of the boron isotope exchange reaction betweent he two boron species revealed that more advanced moleculare orbital theory with a higher level basis set did not necessarily yield better results. It was concluded that HF/6-31G(d) calculations were most appropriate for the present purpose. The RPFRs of the dimers ..... estimated from the RPFRs of the monomers by the use of additivity of the logarithm of RPFRs agreed with those calculated using the frequencies of the dimers within a margin of 1{\%}. This error corresponed to the error of 5{\%} on ln(RPFR). The equilibrium constant of boron isotope exchange reaction between two boron speciew amonf the monomer and dimers at 25 degC varied from 1.0207 to 1.0360, indicating the importance of accurate estimation of the RPFRs of polyboric acids and polyborates in real systems.},

abstract = {Much of our understanding of the ionoregulatory and excretory physiology of blood-feeding insects can be traced to a series of papers by Simon Maddrell and colleagues in the 1970s and 1980s. These studies of the Malpighian (renal) tubules of Rhodnius prolixus revealed a number of physiological adaptations to the short-term and long-term stresses associated with blood feeding. More recent electrophysiological studies using voltage- and ion-selective microelectrodes have extended our understanding of the mechanisms and control of ion transport by the secretory and reabsorptive segments of the Rhodnius Malpighian tubule. The discovery that the rates of transport of organic anions, urates and Ca(2+) are synchronized to coincide with the appearance of the products of blood meal digestion in the haemolymph of Rhodnius has stimulated parallel studies in Drosophila. This recent research has examined how excretory mechanisms for organic cations and organic anions are altered by exposure to such compounds in the diet. These studies also show that the Drosophila Malpighian tubule provides a useful model for analysis of the roles of transporters such as P-glycoproteins and multidrug resistance-associated proteins in the excretion of toxins.},

abstract = {Coccoliths comprise a major fraction of the global carbonate sink. Therefore, changes in coccolithophores' Ca isotopic fractionation could affect seawater Ca isotopic composition, affecting interpretations of the global Ca cycle and related changes in seawater chemistry and climate. Despite this, a quantitative interpretation of coccolith Ca isotopic fractionation and a clear understanding of the mechanisms driving it are not yet available. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by developing a simple model (CaSri–Co) to track coccolith Ca isotopic fractionation during cellular Ca uptake and allocation to calcification. We then apply it to published and new $\delta$44/40Ca and Sr/Ca data of cultured coccolithophores of the species Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica. We identify changes in calcification rates, Ca retention efficiency and solvation–desolvation rates as major drivers of the Ca isotopic fractionation and Sr/Ca variations observed in cultures. Higher calcification rates, higher Ca retention efficiencies and lower solvation–desolvation rates increase both coccolith Ca isotopic fractionation and Sr/Ca. Coccolith Ca isotopic fractionation is most sensitive to changes in solvation–desolvation rates. Changes in Ca retention efficiency may be a major driver of coccolith Sr/Ca variations in cultures. We suggest that substantial changes in the water structure strength caused by past changes in temperature could have induced significant changes in coccolithophores' Ca isotopic fractionation, potentially having some influence on seawater Ca isotopic composition. We also suggest a potential effect on Ca isotopic fractionation via modification of the solvation environment through cellular exudates, a hypothesis that remains to be tested.},

@article{Bazylinski2003a,
abstract = {As stated in an Chapter 4, prokaryotes of both Domains or Superkingdoms, the Bacteria and the Archaea, mediate the formation of a large number of diverse minerals. They are known to do this either through biologically induced mineralization (BIM) (Lowenstam 1981) (the subject of Chapter 4 in this volume; Frankel and Bazylinski 2003) or biologically controlled mineralization (BCM). The latter has also been referred to as organic matrix-mediated mineralization (Lowenstam 1981) and boundary-organized biomineralization (Mann 1986). There are several important differences between BIM and BCM that will be discussed in detail in this chapter, most notably those dealing with aspects of the mineral crystals and the biomineralization process (see also Weiner and Dove 2003). However, there is another significant difference between the two modes of biomineralization and this is the aspect of functionality. Generally, in BIM there is no function to the biomineralized particles except, perhaps, as a solid substrate for attachment in the case of bacteria or as a form of protection against certain environmental conditions or attack from predators. However, it is easier to recognize the primary function of bone or shells produced by molluscs; two well-characterized examples of BCM by higher organisms. Functionality should always be examined when dealing with examples of biomineralization particularly in situations where the mineral product displays some qualities of both BIM and BCM. In BCM, the organism exerts a great degree of crystallochemical control over the nucleation and growth of the mineral particles. For the most part, the minerals are directly synthesized at a specific location within or on the cell and only under certain conditions. The mineral particles produced by bacteria in BCM are characterized as well-ordered crystals with narrow size distributions, and specific, consistent particle morphologies. Because of these features, BCM processes are likely to be under specific chemical/biochemical and genetic control. In the microbial world, the most characterized example of BCM is magnetosome formation by the magnetotactic bacteria, a group of microorganisms in which BCM-produced magnetic crystals appear to have a relatively specific function. There are some examples of biomineralization that appear to be intermediate between BIM and BCM; these are covered in Chapter 4 (Frankel and Bazylinski 2003) since the mineralization product usually has more features in common with BIM. This chapter is, in effect, a review of the magnetotactic bacteria. However, it should be remembered that the production of magnetic minerals by the magnetotactic bacteria is used in this volume as an example of BCM. The microbiological, geological, chemical, biochemical, and physical approaches used to study BCM in the magnetotactic bacteria are universal and will certainly be utilized again in other examples of BCM in bacteria discovered in the future.},

abstract = {Introduction of active chlorophyll a fluorescence protocols, in particular fast repetition rate (FRR) fluorometry, to oceanography and limnology 15 yr ago has enabled rapid assessment of photosynthetic physiology in situ. The FRR protocol generates simultaneous measurements of Photosystem II (PSII) effective absorption cross sections (termed sigma(PSII),l) and photochemical efficiency (termed F-v/F-m). Both F-v/F-m and sigma(PSII) measurements have been utilised to examine the effects of physiological stress on the photosynthetic apparatus of phytoplankton in an ever growing number of fluorescence-based studies. However, it is now becoming clearer that in situ values of F-v/F-m, and sigma(PSII) also contain taxonomic information. Here, we present a synthesis of previously unpublished and published data, which show that F-v/F-m and sigma(PSII) vary principally with broad-scale changes in community structure. These patterns observed in situ conform to trends observed in la boratory-grown cultures of a range of phytoplankton taxa. The magnitudes of variability in Fv/F-m and sigma(PSII) driven by changes in phytoplankton community structure often exceed that induced by nutrient limitation (as determined from controlled nutrient addition experiments). An exception to this general trend occurs in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll a (HNLC) regions, where strong phenotypic changes in F-v/F-m and sigma(PSII) have been repeatedly demonstrated on relief of iron limitation. Overall, FRR fluorescence measurements of both F-v/F-m, and sigma(PSII) in natural populations represent a combination of the taxonomic 'signature' (values of F-v/F-m and sigma(PSII) determined by the taxa present) within the phytoplankton community that is further modified according to the (photo-) physiological status. As such, fluorescence-based investigations of mixed populations must account for potential variations in phytoplankton community structure before interpretations of physiological status are made.},

abstract = {The early effects of heat stress on the photosynthesis of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) within the tissues of a reef-building coral were examined using pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence and photorespirometry. Exposure of Stylophora pistillata to 33 and 34 degrees C for 4 h resulted in (1) the development of strong non-photochemical quenching (qN) of the chlorophyll fluorescence signal, (2) marked decreases in photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and (3) decreases in optimal quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystern II (PSII), Quantum yield decreased to a greater extent on the illuminated surfaces of coral branches than on lower (shaded) surfaces, and also when high irradiance intensities were combined with elevated temperature (33 degrees C as opposed to 28 degrees C), qN collapsed in heat-stressed samples when quenching analysis was conducted in the absence of oxygen, Collectively, these observations are interpreted as the initiation of photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed energy as heat (qN) and O-2-dependent electron flow through the Mehler-Ascorbate-Peroxidase cycle (MAP-cycle) following the point at which the rate of light-driven electron transport exceeds the capacity of the Calvin cycle. A model for coral bleaching is proposed whereby the primary site of heat damage in S, pistillata is carboxylation within the Calvin cycle, as has been observed during heat damage in higher plants, Damage to PSII and a reduction in F-v/F-m (i.e. photoinhibition) are secondary effects following the overwhelming of photoprotective mechanisms by light. This secondary factor increases the effect of the primary variable, temperature. Potential restrictions of electron flow in heat-stressed zooxanthellae are discussed with respect to Calvin cycle enzymes and the unusual status of the dinoflagellate Rubisco, Significant features of our model are that (1) damage to PSII is not the initial step in the sequence of heat stress in zooxanthellae, acid (2) light plays a key secondary role in the initiation of the bleaching phenomena.},

The thermodynamics of the process is considered and expressions are given for the supersaturation, the nucleation work and the size of the nucleus in homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation. It is shown how the nucleation theorem can be used for a model-independent determination of the nucleus size from experimental data. The mechanism and kinetics of nucleation are also considered and formulae are presented for the supersaturation dependence of the monomer attachment frequency and the stationary rate of homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation. General expressions for the induction time and the critical supersaturation ratio for crystallization are given. An approximate formula is derived for estimating the width of the metastable zone with the help of data for the solubility of the substance crystallized. Existing experimental data are used for verification of the validity of some of the presented theoretical dependences.},

abstract = {Sulfonated (SO 3H-PMS) and carboxylated (CO 2H-PMS) polymethylsiloxanes were synthesized and their effects as anionic template modifier on the CaCO 3 crystal morphologies were evaluated. In vitro crystallization assays of CaCO 3 were performed at room temperature by using gas diffusion method at different concentration, pH and time. SEM images of CaCO 3 showed well-defined short calcite piles (ca. 5 $\mu$m) and elongated calcite (ca. 20 $\mu$m) when SO 3H-PMS was used. When CO 2H-PMS was used, the morphology of CaCO 3 crystals was single-truncated at pH 7-9 and aggregated-modified calcite at pH 10-11. However, at pH 12 the least stable donut-shaped vaterite crystals were formed. EDS and XRD confirmed the presence of Si from anionic PMS templates on the CaCO 3 surfaces and its polymorphism, respectively. Results showed that the selective morphologies of CaCO 3 reflect the electrostatic interaction of anionic groups of functionalized PMS with Ca 2 adsorbed on CaCO 3 crystals. Rounded and truncated-modified fluorescent CaCO 3 was also produced by the inclusion of functionalized PMS into the lattice of CaCO 3 matrix. We demonstrated that the anionic PMS offer a good modifier for polymer-controlled crystallization and a convenient approach for understanding the biomineralization field. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Bazylinski2003,
abstract = {As stated in an Chapter 4, prokaryotes of both Domains or Superkingdoms, the Bacteria and the Archaea, mediate the formation of a large number of diverse minerals. They are known to do this either through biologically induced mineralization (BIM) (Lowenstam 1981) (the subject of Chapter 4 in this volume; Frankel and Bazylinski 2003) or biologically controlled mineralization (BCM). The latter has also been referred to as organic matrix-mediated mineralization (Lowenstam 1981) and boundary-organized biomineralization (Mann 1986). There are several important differences between BIM and BCM that will be discussed in detail in this chapter, most notably those dealing with aspects of the mineral crystals and the biomineralization process (see also Weiner and Dove 2003). However, there is another significant difference between the two modes of biomineralization and this is the aspect of functionality. Generally, in BIM there is no function to the biomineralized particles except, perhaps, as a solid substrate for attachment in the case of bacteria or as a form of protection against certain environmental conditions or attack from predators. However, it is easier to recognize the primary function of bone or shells produced by molluscs; two well-characterized examples of BCM by higher organisms. Functionality should always be examined when dealing with examples of biomineralization particularly in situations where the mineral product displays some qualities of both BIM and BCM. In BCM, the organism exerts a great degree of crystallochemical control over the nucleation and growth of the mineral particles. For the most part, the minerals are directly synthesized at a specific location within or on the cell and only under certain conditions. The mineral particles produced by bacteria in BCM are characterized as well-ordered crystals with narrow size distributions, and specific, consistent particle morphologies. Because of these features, BCM processes are likely to be under specific chemical/biochemical and genetic control. In the microbial world, the most characterized example of BCM is magnetosome formation by the magnetotactic bacteria, a group of microorganisms in which BCM-produced magnetic crystals appear to have a relatively specific function. There are some examples of biomineralization that appear to be intermediate between BIM and BCM; these are covered in Chapter 4 (Frankel and Bazylinski 2003) since the mineralization product usually has more features in common with BIM. This chapter is, in effect, a review of the magnetotactic bacteria. However, it should be remembered that the production of magnetic minerals by the magnetotactic bacteria is used in this volume as an example of BCM. The microbiological, geological, chemical, biochemical, and physical approaches used to study BCM in the magnetotactic bacteria are universal and will certainly be utilized again in other examples of BCM in bacteria discovered in the future.},

The resulting mixing affects ocean stratification and ocean circulation. It thus influences climate as well as biological production. The energy for the internal tides is derived from the rotational energy of the Earth-Moon system changes of the length of the day and the distance to the Moon.},

The absence of any change with depth in total hydrocarbon concentrations from some sediment cores and the presence of distinct 'oil' horizons in others suggests that mixing of sediments in the area is very random.

This acidification process has changed the saturation state of the oceans with respect to calcium carbonate (CaCO (sub 3) ) particles. Here we estimate the in situ CaCO (sub 3) dissolution rates for the global oceans from total alkalinity and chlorofluorocarbon data, and we also discuss the future impacts of anthropogenic CO (sub 2) on CaCO (sub 3) shell-forming species. CaCO (sub 3) dissolution rates, ranging from 0.003 to 1.2 micromoles per kilogram per year, are observed beginning near the aragonite saturation horizon. The total water column CaCO (sub 3) dissolution rate for the global oceans is approximately 0.5+ or -0.2 petagrams of CaCO (sub 3) -C per year, which is approximately 45 to 65{\%} of the export production of CaCO (sub 3) . },

This paper discusses the following problems: (1) the magnitude of the effect expected, (2) the mass spectrometer of high sensitivity, (3) the preservation of the record during geological time, (4) the constancy of the isotopic composition of the ocean, (5) the impossibility of using skeletons of air breathing animals, and (6) the temperature of marine animals relative to their surroundings. A Jurassic belemnite is used to show that the record has been retained since Jurassic times, and belemnites of the Upper Cretaceous of the United States, England, and Denmark are used to determine the tempera- ture of this time at these localities. The temperatures are about 15°-16°C and indicate nearly uniform tem- perature over this latitudinal belt. Because of the possible variation in O18 content of the oceans and the limited number of samples, these temperatures are regarded as preliminary. CONTENTS},

abstract = {Reconstructions of Ba distributions in ancient oceanic surface waters could provide new insight into paleoceanographic change. Calcite shells of planktonic foraminifera potentially provide a means of reconstructing such paleo-Ba distributions if lattice-bound Ba can be determined on shells recovered from deep-sea cores. Planktonic foraminifera shells from a series of cores were purified of non-lattice-bound Ba associated with organic or sedimentary phases by a combination of physical agitation, oxidative-reductive steps, acid leaches, and a novel alkaline-DTPA step to dissolve barite. A sequential dissolution of a large sample of cleaned shells of the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides conglobatus indicates homogeneous distribution of Ba in the shell material. Comparison of shells from sediments, sediment traps, and plankton tows indicates no significant differences in the Ba content of the purified shells. Cleaned samples of the planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides sacculifera, G. ruber, G. conglobatus, Orbulina spp., and Globoquadrina dutertrei from the equatorial Pacific, North Atlantic, and Mediterranean Sea have Ba Ca ratios between 0.6 and 1.0 ??mol/mol (0.8 to 1.4 ppm). Variation in foraminiferal Ba contents between the three basins is consistent with the trend in surface seawater Ba. The calculated distribution coefficient for Ba incorporation in these five species based on these data is 0.19 ?? 0.05. Several species of the non-spinose planktonic foraminifera Globorotalia have Ba Ca ratios ranging from 2 to 13 ??mol/mol; these high Ba contents might be explained by differences in the way these foraminifera precipitate their shells. A temporal record of Ba Ca in samples of Globigerinoides and Orbulina from a core in the northwest Atlantic suggests that the Ba concentration of surface waters at this site has not changed by more than 20{\%} over the last 14 kyr. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Recent studies indicate that Oithona spp. contribute significantly to total copepod biomass. Little is known, however, about their ecological significance, particularly in the case of the estuarine Oithona nana. A study comprising three sites within Southampton Water was conducted to evaluate the late-stage copepodite/adult (stages IV–VI) O. nana community, using 120-µm mesh nets. Although present throughout the estuary, there was a striking spatial gradient with O. nana most common in the upper estuary. A clear seasonal pattern was observed with O. nana as the most abundant copepod species from late summer until early winter. It comprised 61{\%} of all copepods recorded, with a biomass of 757.22 mg C m–3. Production estimates of O. nana were derived from the ‘instantaneous-growth' approach, using appropriate growth equations. The estimated production of O. nana ranged from 1.50 mg C m–3 year–1 within the lower estuary to 146.77 mg C m–3 year–1 in the upper estuary. In the upper estuary, this compares with production rates of 187.47 mg C m–3 year–1 for all Acartia congeners (excluding nauplii), the most common calanoid genus. Throughout the estuary, O. nana annual production represented 18{\%} of total copepod production clearly indicating that, at least in the upper estuary, O. nana production may be directly comparable with calanoid production.},

abstract = {The rectal temperature of normal healthy camels at rest may vary from about 34{\{}degrees{\}}C to more than 40{\{}degrees{\}}C. Diurnal variations in the winter are usually in the order of 2{\{}degrees{\}}C. In summer the diurnal variations in the camel deprived of drinking water may exceed 6{\{}degrees{\}}C, but in animals with free access to water the variations are similar to those found in the winter. The variations in temperature are of great significance in water conservation in two ways. a) The increase in body temperature means that heat is stored in the body instead of being dissipated by evaporation of water. At night the excess heat can be given off without expenditure of water. b) The high body temperature means that heat gain from the hot environment is reduced because the temperature gradient is reduced. The effect of the increased body temperature on heat gain from the environment has been calculated from data on water expenditure. These calculations show that under the given conditions the variations in body temperature effect a considerable economy of water expenditure. The evaporative heat regulation in the camel seems to rest exclusively on evaporation from the skin surface (sweating), and there is no apparent increase in respiratory rate or panting connected with heat regulation. The evaporation from isolated skin areas increases linearly with increased heat load. The critical temperature at which the increase sets in is around 35{\{}degrees{\}}C. The fur of the camel is an efficient barrier against heat gain from the environment. Water expenditure is increased in camels that have been shorn.},

abstract = {In this study we present the results of a detailed analysis on calcareous nannofossil assemblages from sediment cores of ODP Site 1263 (Southern East Atlantic, Walvis Ridge). This section represents one of the few complete deep-sea sections that document the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) in the pelagic realm. The PETM transient event was characterized by a brief, but intense interval of global warming, a global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE), and widespread dissolution of seafloor carbonate sediments. Paired analysis at polarizing light microscope (LM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) documents the different "behavior" of nannofossils through the different phases of the PETM, at the onset of CIE, within the CIE, and during the recovery interval. The presence of anomalous specimens and morphotypes within some nannofossil taxa, recorded during previous LM high resolution analyses, has been further investigated in selected samples at the SEM. Besides the known representatives of the CIE-PETM "excursion nanno-flora", as Rhomboaster calcitrapa group and Discoaster anartios, the analysis revealed the presence of peculiar morphotypes of Fasciculithus and deformed specimens of Discoaster nobilis group, Discoaster mediosus and Discoaster multiradiatus that are considered related to the anomalous amount of CO2 in the ocean-atmosphere system during the early phase of PETM. Comparative analyses were performed in few selected samples from other PETM sections located at different latitudes in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Although the anomalous geochemical conditions during the PETM-CIE interval seem to have had some influence on the nannofossil production, calcification and assemblage composition, it results that local productivity together with post depositional (diagenetic) conditions were additional important controlling factors on nannofossil assemblages. Preliminary data from Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM2 or Elmo) suggest that nannofossil malformations are not exclusive of the PETM, and are associated to other episodes of perturbation of the C cycle. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we describe a new gene, SCRAMBLED (SCM), required for cells to appropriately interpret their location within the developing root epidermis. SCM encodes a receptor-like kinase protein with a predicted extracellular domain of six leucine-rich repeats and an intracellular serine-threonine kinase domain. SCM regulates the expression of the GLABRA2, CAPRICE, WEREWOLF,and ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 transcription factor genes that define the cell fates. Further, the SCM gene is expressed throughout the developing root. Therefore, SCM likely enables developing epidermal cells to detect positional cues and establish an appropriate cell-type pattern.},

abstract = {The operation of the carbon cycle forms an important part of the processes relevant to future changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide. The balance of carbon between terrestrial and oceanic reservoirs is an important factor and here we focus in particular on the oceans. Future changes in the carbon cycle that may affect air-sea partitioning of CO(2) are difficult to quantify but the palaeoceanographic record and modern observational studies provide important evidence of what variations might occur. These include changes in surface nutrient use, the oceanic inventory of nutrients, and the elemental composition and rain-rate ratio of marine particles. Recent work has identified two inter-linked processes of potential importance that we consider in some detail: the response of marine calcification to changes in surface water CO(2) and the association of particulate organic carbon with ballast minerals, in particular biogenic calcite. We review evidence from corals, coccolithophores and foraminifera, which suggests that the response of reduced calcification provides a negative feedback on rising atmospheric CO(2). We then use a box model to demonstrate how the calcification response may affect the organic carbon rain rate through the ballast effect. The ballast effect on export fluxes of organic and inorganic carbon acts to counteract the negative calcification response to increased CO(2). Thus, two oceanic buffers exert a significant control on ocean-atmosphere carbonate chemistry: the thermodynamic CO(2) buffer; and the ballast/calcification buffer. Just how tightly coupled the rain-rate ratio of CaCO(3)/C(org) is to fluxes of ballast minerals is an important question for future research.},

abstract = {The connection between development and evolution has become the focus of an increasing amount of research in recent years, and heterochrony has long been a key concept in this relation. Heterochrony is defined as evolutionary change in rates and timing of developmental processes; the dimension of time is therefore an essential part in studies of heterochrony. Over the past two decades, evolutionary biologists have used several methodological frameworks to analyse heterochrony, which differ substantially in the way they characterize evolutionary changes in ontogenies and in the resulting classification, although they mostly use the same terms. This review examines how these methods compare ancestral and descendant ontogenies, emphasizing their differences and the potential for contradictory results from analyses using different frameworks. One of the two principal methods uses a clock as a graphical display for comparisons of size, shape and age at a particular ontogenic stage, whereas the other characterizes a developmental process by its time of onset, rate, and time of cessation. The literature on human heterochrony provides particularly clear examples of how these differences produce apparent contradictions when applied to the same problem. Developmental biologists recently have extended the concept of heterochrony to the earliest stages of development and have applied it at the cellular and molecular scale. This extension brought considerations of developmental mechanisms and genetics into the study of heterochrony, which previously was based primarily on phenomenological characterizations of morphological change in ontogeny. Allometry is the pattern of covariation among several morphological traits or between measures of size and shape; unlike heterochrony, allometry does not deal with time explicitly. Two main approaches to the study of allometry are distinguished, which differ in the way they characterize organismal form. One approach defines shape as proportions among measurements, based on considerations of geometric similarity, whereas the other focuses on the covariation among measurements in ontogeny and evolution. Both are related conceptually and through the use of similar algebra. In addition, there are close connections between heterochrony and changes in allometric growth trajectories, although there is no one-to-one correspondence. These relationships and outline links between different analytical frameworks are discussed.},

abstract = {We were interested in monitoring zeta potential of CaCO3 freshly precipitated from Na2CO3 and CaCl2 solutions at 30°C and in pH changes of the slurry. This seemed interesting to us in aspect of hard scale formation. The influence of impurity ions and magnetic field (MF) on the parameters were also investigated. Before calcium carbonate precipitation the solutions were exposed to a permanent N-S (B=0.4 T) MF applied orthogonally to silicone tubes in which the solutions circulated for 30 min. Then, after CaCO3 precipitation time dependent changes of zeta potential and pH were measured. The same parameters were also determined for the reference systems in which the solutions were not MF-treated. Besides the zeta potentials of CaCO3 precipitated from equimolar (8×10-3 M) Ca2+/CO32-, also these precipitated from excess 1.2×10-2 M of Ca2+ and 8×10-3 M CO32-, or reverse, were measured up to 60 min (in some systems up to 240 min). Simultaneously pH of the suspensions was recorded. It was found that MF effect on the zeta potential depended on the Ca2+/CO32- ratio and the "memory effect" lasted for a longer time if calcium carbonate was precipitated at the excess of Ca2+ or CO32- ions. The experiments of CaCO3 precipitation in the presence of impurity ions: Mg2+, Fe2+, or SO42-, which are very common in natural deposit of the scale showed that both the ions and MF affect all the investigated parameters. In these systems precipitation and sedimentation rates were determined by measuring the light absorbance at $\lambda$=543.3 nm. The effects depended on the kind of the impurity ion present. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Low temperature diffuse hydrothermal circulation is a natural consequence of the cooling of the oceanic lithosphere. Diffuse flow is expected to be ubiquitous, and will be present both within mid-ocean ridge crest axial zones of young age (0-1 Ma), and also on the older ridge crest flanks and limbs. If underlying thermal models are correct, hydrothermal circulation should persist for oceanic lithosphere of age 0-65 Ma, and is present over half the total area of the ocean basins. By using numerical models of hydrothermal circulation in cracked permeable media, we show qualitatively how diffuse flow is an intrinsic feature of high temperature axial (0-1 Ma) hydrothermal systems, and is not restricted to older (more than 1 Ma) lithosphere. This is in agreement with our field observations which suggest that in such high temperature vent fields the greatest part of the heat and volume flux is due to lower temperature diffuse flow, rather than high temperature black smoker venting.By combining direct measurements of the physical properties of diffusely flowing effluent within axial hydrothermal systems with concurrent sampling of the chemical properties of that effluent, and by considering also the chemistry of unmixed black smoker endmember fluids from the same hydrothermal systems, the processes of mineral deposition and dissolution can be studied directly. By referring to the present-day lithology of such areas, it is possible to examine the balance between concurrent mineral deposition and dissolution processes, and the retention rate of specific mineral assemblages integrated over the history of the hydrothermal system. Thus details of the episodicity of hydrothermal venting within the system may be revealed. An example of this method of combining a variety of direct measurements of diffuse and high temperature effluent properties is given from the TAG hydrothermal field, Mid-Atlantic Ridge.Long time series observations of the physical properties of diffuse and high temperature effluent reveal the importance both of tidal variability and also the response to changes in the permeability structure of the system brought about by natural and anthropogenic processes. Several mechanisms are considered to explain the relationship between ocean tidal loading, solid Earth tidal deformations, and the observed changes in flow within axial hydrothermal systems.},

The TEM images and diffraction patterns allow the internal structure of the micro-domains to be described. Each of them is enriched in Ca-carbonate. Hosted in distinct regions of each prism, some are fully amorphous, and some others fully crystallized as subunits of a large calcite single crystal. At the border separating the two regions, micro-domains display a crystallized core and an amorphous rim. Such a border probably marks out an arrested crystallization front having propagated through a previously bio-controlled architecture of the piling of amorphous micro-domains. Compared to recent data concerning the stepping mode of growth of the calcite prisms and the resulting layered organization at the microm-scale, these results give unexpected views regarding the modalities of biocrystallization.},

abstract = {Past atmospheric methane-concentration oscillations recorded in polar ice cores vary together with rapid global climatic changes during the last glacial episode. In the "clathrate gun hypothesis," massive releases of deep-sea methane from marine gas-hydrate dissociation led to these well known, global, abrupt warmings in the past. If evidence for such releases in the water column exists, however, the mechanism and eventual transfer to the atmosphere has not yet been documented clearly. Here we describe a high-resolution marine-sediment record of stable carbon isotopic changes from the Papua Gulf, off Papua New Guinea, which exhibits two extremely depleted excursions (down to -9 per thousand ) at approximately 39,000 and approximately 55,000 years. Morphological, isotopic, and trace metal evidence dismisses authigenic calcite as the main source of depleted carbon. Massive methane release associated with deep-sea gas-hydrate dissociation is the most likely cause for such large depletions of delta(13)C. The absence of a delta(13)C gradient in the water column during these events implies that the methane rose through the entire water column, reaching the sea-air interface and thus the atmosphere. Foraminiferal delta(18)O composition suggests that the rise of the methane in the water column created an upwelling flow. These inferred emission events suggest that during the last glacial episode, this process was likely widespread, including tropical regions. Thus, the release of methane from the ocean floor into the atmosphere cannot be dismissed as a strong positive feedback in climate dynamics processes.},

Using published equilibrium ??44/40Cacarb-aq and KSr d values we estimate the equilibrium isotope fractionation of strontium to be very close to zero (??88/86Sreq(carb-aq) = -0.01 ?? 0.06{\%}). This estimate is confirmed by strontium isotope values of natural inorganic calcites that precipitated very slowly in basalts of the ocean crust. The results from the inorganic calcites are used to explain strontium isotope fractionation of planktic foraminifera. Specimens of two warm water species (Globigerinoides ruber and Globigerinoides sacculifer) were picked from the Holocene section of a Caribbean sediment core. We found no significant difference in ??88/86Sr between the two species. In addition, G. ruber specimens from Marine Isotope Stage 2 in the same core show ??88/86Sr values identical to the Holocene specimens. The strontium isotopes of both foraminifera species are strongly fractionated (??88/86Srcarb-aq = -0.248 ?? 0.005{\%}) when compared to published data of other major marine calcifiers. Applying the results from the inorganic precipitation experiments we find that the strong foraminiferal strontium isotope fractionation can be explained by calcification in a largely open system at high precipitation rates, comparable in magnitude to rates known from scleractinian reef corals. This interpretation is in good agreement with the kinetic calcification model for planktic foraminifera by Kisak??rek et al. (2011), which was based on calcium isotopes and elemental Sr/Ca ratios. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The temperature and degree of carbonate mineral supersaturation (CO3−2 ion concentration) of seawater are the two most likely controlling variables on the compositions of recent marine carbonate cements. The relative importance of these variables is difficult to assess in nature because they have similar trends with depth (0–1500 m) and latitude in modern oceans. We carried out laboratory experiments to investigate the relative growth rates of calcite, Mg calcite, and aragonite in seawater as functions of both temperature (5, 25, and 37 °C) and of carbonate ion concentration (2.5 to 15 times supersaturated with respect to calcite).The precipitation rates of aragonite relative to those of calcite increase strongly with increasing temperature and are not affected greatly by changes in saturation state. At 5 °C, calcite precipitation rates are nearly equivalent to those of aragonite, regardless of the degree of saturation. At both 25 and 37 °C, aragonite precipitation rates are much more rapid than those of calcite (up to a factor of 4), except at very low saturation states. Calcite compositions vary from less than 5 mol{\%} MgCO3 at 5 °C to 14 mol{\%} MgCO3 at 37 °C. Our results suggest that the well-documented shift toward precipitation of lower mol{\%} Mg calcite and the decrease in abundance of aragonite cements with increasing oceanic depth and latitude can be attributed largely to lower temperatures.},

abstract = {Most tropical fishes are ammonotelic, producing ammonia and excreting it as NH3 by diffusion across the branchial epithelia. Hence, those air-breathing tropical fishes that survive on land briefly or for an extended period would have difficulties in excreting ammonia when out of water. Ammonia is toxic, but some of these air-breathing fishes adopt special biochemical adaptations to ameliorate the toxicity of endogenous ammonia accumulating in the body. The amphibious mudskipper Periophthalmodon schlosseri, which is very active on land, reduces ammonia production by suppressing amino acid catabolism (strategy 1) during aerial exposure. It can also undergo partial amino acid catabolism, leading to the accumulation of alanine (strategy 2) to support locomotory activities on land. In this case, alanine formation is not an ammonia detoxification process but reduces the production of endogenous ammonia. The snakehead Channa asiatica, which exhibits moderate activities on land although not truly amphibious, accumulates both alanine and glutamine in the muscle, with alanine accounting for 80{\%} of the deficit in reduction in ammonia excretion during air exposure. Unlike P. schlosseri, C. asiatica apparently cannot reduce the rates of protein and amino acid catabolism and is incapable of utilizing partial amino acid catabolism to support locomotory activities on land. Unlike alanine formation, glutamine synthesis (strategy 3) represents an ammonia detoxification mechanism that, in effect, removes the accumulating ammonia. The four-eyed sleeper Bostrichyths sinensis, which remains motionless during aerial exposure, detoxifies endogenous ammonia to glutamine for storage. The slender African lungfish Protopterus dolloi, which can aestivate on land on a mucus cocoon, has an active ornithine-urea cycle and converts endogenous ammonia to urea (strategy 4) for both storage and subsequent excretion. Production of urea and glutamine are energetically expensive and appear to be adopted by fishes that remain relatively inactive on land. The Oriental weatherloach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, which actively burrows into soft mud during drought, manipulates the pH of the body surface to facilitate NH3 volatilization (strategy 5) and develops high ammonia tolerance at the cellular and subcellular levels (strategy 6) during aerial exposure. Hence, with regard to excretory nitrogen metabolism, modern tropical air-breathing fishes exhibit a variety of strategies to survive on land, and they represent a spectrum of specimens through which we may examine various biochemical adaptations that would have facilitated the invasion of the terrestrial habitat by fishes during evolution.},

This complexity ranges from the macroscopic structures observed with the naked eye down to sub micrometric structures only revealed by micro analytical techniques. Understanding to what extent and how organisms can control the formation of these structures requires that the mineral and organic phases can be identified and their spatial distribution related. Here we demonstrate the capability of confocal Raman microscopy applied to cross sections of a shell of Nerita undata to describe the distribution of calcite and aragonite including their crystallographic orientation with high lateral resolution ({\~{}}300 nm). Moreover, spatial distribution of functional groups of organic compounds can be simultaneously acquired, allowing to specifically relate them to the observed microstructures. The data presented in this case study highlights the possible new contributions of this method to the description of modalities of Nerita undata shell formation, and what could be expected of its application to other marine biogenic carbonates. Localization of areas of interest would also allow further investigations using more localized methods, such as TEM that would provide complementary information on the relation between organic molecules and crystal lattice.},

The method is applied to calcite crystallization on carboxylate terminated alkanethiols arrayed on Au (111). We demonstrate that a dynamic treatment of the monolayer is sufficient to reproduce the experimental results without the need to impose epitaxial constraints on the system. We also observe an odd-even effect in the variation of selectivity with organic chain length, reproducing experimentally observed orientations in both cases. Analysis of the ordering process in our simulations suggests a cycle of mutual control in which both the organic and mineral components induce complementary local order across the interface, leading to the formation of a critical crystalline region. The influence of pH, together with some factors that might affect the range of applicability of our method, is discussed.},

abstract = {Constraining the magnitude of high-latitude temperature change across the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) is essential for quantifying the magnitude of Antarctic ice-sheet expansion and understanding regional climate response to this event. To this end, we constructed high-resolution stable oxygen isotope ($\delta$ 18O) and magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) records from planktic and benthic foraminifera at four Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites in the Southern Ocean. Planktic foraminiferal Mg/Ca records from the Kerguelen Plateau (ODP Sites 738, 744, and 748) show a consistent pattern of temperature change, indicating 2-3°C cooling in direct conjunction with the first step of a two-step increase in benthic and planktic foraminiferal $\delta$ 18O values across the EOT. In contrast, benthic Mg/Ca records from Maud Rise (ODP Site 689) and the Kerguelen Plateau (ODP Site 748) do not exhibit significant temperature change. The contrasting temperature histories derived from the planktic and benthic Mg/Ca records are not reconcilable, since vertical $\delta$ 18O gradients remained nearly constant at all sites between 35.0 and 32.5Ma. Based on the coherency of the planktic Mg/Ca records from the Kerguelen Plateau sites and complications with benthic Mg/Ca paleothermometry at low temperatures, the planktic Mg/Ca records are deemed the most reliable measure of Southern Ocean temperature change. We therefore interpret a uniform cooling of 2-3°C in both deep surface (thermocline) waters and intermediate deep waters of the Southern Ocean across the EOT. Cooling of Southern Ocean surface waters across the EOT was likely propagated to the deep ocean, since deep waters were primarily sourced on the Antarctic margin throughout this time interval. Removal of the temperature component from the observed foraminiferal $\delta$ 18O shift indicates that seawater $\delta$ 18O values increased by 0.6±0.15{\%} across the EOT interval, corresponding to an increase in global ice volume to a level equivalent with 60-130{\%} modern East Antarctic ice sheet volume. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The ultrastructure of the calcitic prisms of the prismatic shell layers of pteriomorph bivalves was examined by scanning electronic microscopy and diffraction techniques. Results indicate that the internal structure of the prisms is noticeably different among taxa. In species belonging to the families Pinnidae, Pteriidae, and Isognomonidae (Pterioida), prisms are built up with nanometric calcite crystals. On the other hand, Pectinidae, Propeamussliidae, Anomiidae (order Pectinoida) and the Ostreidae (Ostreoida) have prisms constituted by calcitic laths with micrometric size. These laths are indistinguishable from those constituting the foliated microstructure. In almost all cases, there is mineral continuity from the prisms to the underlying foliated layer, as confirmed by X-ray texture analyses. These findings corroborate a previous assumption that the foliated microstructure derived from calcitic prisms, particularly from those with internal foliated structure. The appearance of the foliated microstructure facilitated drastic mineralogical and microstructural changes in pteriomorph shells-for example, the development of rigid shell margins and the production of largely calcitic shells. Such changes have, no doubt, contributed to the evolutionary success of the groups, which have shown a pronounced diversification over time.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. The Mg/Ca ratio of the planktic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber is widely used for reconstructing past sea surface temperatures. The shell Mg/Ca ratio is also lowered by dissolution, which results in lower sea surface temperature estimates in partially dissolved shells. Here we use an electron microprobe image mapping technique to map the intrashell variability of the Mg/Ca ratio in G. ruber (white) sensu stricto shells to explore changes in the intrashell Mg/Ca ratio associated with dissolution. We examine shells from shallow and deep cores (Ceara Rise, western tropical Atlantic) from the Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum that represent a preservational gradient. Image map results show that the Mg/Ca ratio is highly variable both within a single shell and among samples obtained from the same sediment interval. Our results show that intrashell Mg/Ca variability is retained in samples that have undergone dissolution. Quantitative analysis of the data from Mg/Ca mapping suggests that preferential loss of high-Mg/Ca calcite alone cannot account for the difference in intrashell Mg/Ca variability of shells from shallow and deep cores in both time periods. Rather, the data imply that, in G. ruber analyzed in this study, there is a loss of high Mg/Ca ratios accompanied by a more uniform lowering of Mg/Ca over the range of intershell Mg/Ca variability of shells subjected to dissolution at the 1 $\mu$m resolution of the microprobe analysis in this study.},

Results show that oxygen isotopic temperatures of Foraminifera tests may be used to locate ocean currents and to define the orientation of large crustal plates relative to the earth's rotational poles. Selective solution effects may cause isotopic temperatures of some species to become progressively colder with increasing water depth of the sediments from which they are taken. Where this is not taken into account, erroneous conclusions may result from the comparison of isotopic temperatures of samples from different locations. Depths at which Foraminifera secrete their tests appear to be determined by density and ultimately by osmotic equilibration with surrounding sea water. Susceptibility of Foraminifera tests to selective solution after death increases with magnesium content. Carbon isotope ratios correlate crudely with both temperature and salinity. The C13/C12 ratio of dissolved or particulate carbon in the oceans is probably the most important factor in determining the C13/C12 ratio of the test.},

Experiments were carried out at 5 to 75 ??C, using the protocol of Kinsman and Holland [Kinsman, D.J.J., Holland, H.D., 1969. The coprecipitation of cations with CaCO3 IV. The coprecipitation of Sr2+ with aragonite between 16 and 96 ??C. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 33, 1-17.] The concentrations of Mg Sr and Ba were determined in the fluid from each experiment by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and in individual aragonite grains by secondary ion mass spectrometry. The experimentally produced aragonite grains are enriched in trace components ("impurities") relative to the concentrations expected from crystal-fluid equilibrium, indicating that kinetic processes are controlling element distribution. Our data are not consistent with fractionations produced kinetically in a boundary layer adjacent to the growing crystal because Sr2+, a compatible element, is enriched rather than depleted in the aragonite. Element compatibilities, and the systematic change in partitioning with temperature, can be explained by the process of surface entrapment proposed by Watson and Liang [Watson, E.B., Liang, Y., 1995. A simple model for sector zoning in slowly grown crystals: implications for growth rate and lattice diffusion, with emphasis on accessory minerals in crustal rocks. Am. Mineral. 80, 1179-1187] and Watson [Watson, E.B., 1996. Surface enrichment and trace-element uptake during crystal growth. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 60, 5013-5020; Watson, E.B., 2004. A conceptual model for near-surface kinetic controls on the trace-element and stable isotope composition of abiogenic calcite crystals. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 68, 1473-1488]. This process is thought to operate in regimes where the competition between crystal growth rate and diffusivity in the near-surface region limits the extent to which the solid can achieve partitioning equilibrium with the fluid. A comparison of the skeletal composition of Diploria labyrinthiformis (brain coral) collected on Bermuda with results from precipitation calculations carried out using our experimentally determined partition coefficients indicate that the fluid from which coral skeleton precipitates has a Sr/Ca ratio comparable to that of seawater, but is depleted in Mg and Ba, and that there are seasonal fluctuations in the mass fraction of aragonite precipitated from the calcifying fluid ("precipitation efficiency"). The combined effects of surface entrapment during aragonite growth and seasonal fluctuations in "precipitation efficiency" likely forms the basis for the temperature information recorded in the aragonite skeletons of Scleractinian corals. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We emphasize the roles of these associations in the reliable recognition of visual landmarks and the reliable performance of learnt routes. It is unknown whether such associations also provide insects with a map-like representation of familiar terrain.

Laboratory-based studies have shown that these atomic-scale processes can profoundly influence the architecture and composition of minerals, but their importance in calcifying organisms is poorly understood because it is difficult to measure the chemistry of in vivo biomineral interfaces at spatially relevant scales. Understanding the role of templates in biomineral nucleation, and their importance in skeletal geochemistry requires an integrated, multiscale approach, which can place atom-scale observations of organic-mineral interfaces within a broader structural and geochemical context. Here we map the chemistry of an embedded organic template structure within a carbonate skeleton of the foraminifera Orbulina universa using both atom probe tomography (APT), a 3D chemical imaging technique with {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m-level spatial resolution, and time-of-flight secondary ionization mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), a 2D chemical imaging technique with submicron resolution. We quantitatively link these observations, revealing that the organic template in O. universa is uniquely enriched in both Na and Mg, and contributes to intraskeletal chemical heterogeneity. Our APT analyses reveal the cation composition of the organic surface, offering evidence to suggest that cations other than Ca(2+), previously considered passive spectator ions in biomineral templating, may be important in defining the energetics of carbonate nucleation on organic templates.},

abstract = {The characteristic shapes, structures and properties of biominerals arise from their interplay with a macromolecular matrix. The developing mineral interacts with acidic macromolecules, which are either dissolved in the crystallization medium or associated with insoluble matrix polymers, that affect growth habits and phase selection or completely inhibit precipitation in solution. Yet little is known about the role of matrix-immobilized acidic macromolecules in directing mineralization. Here, by using in situ liquid-phase electron microscopy to visualize the nucleation and growth of CaCO3 in a matrix of polystyrene sulphonate (PSS), we show that the binding of calcium ions to form Ca-PSS globules is a key step in the formation of metastable amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), an important precursor phase in many biomineralization systems. Our findings demonstrate that ion binding can play a significant role in directing nucleation, independently of any control over the free-energy barrier to nucleation.},

@article{Wanless2007,
abstract = {Top predators, particularly seabirds, have repeatedly been suggested as indicators of marine ecosystem status. One region currently under pressure from human fisheries and climate change is the North Sea. Standardized seabird monitoring data have been collected on the Isle of May, an important seabird colony in the northwestern North Sea, over the last 10-20 years. Over this period oceanographic conditions have varied markedly, and between 1990 and 1999 a major industrial fishery for sandlance (Ammodytes marinus), the main prey of most seabird species, was prosecuted nearby. Sandlance fishing grounds close to seabird colonies down the east coast of the UK were closed in 2000 in an attempt to improve foraging opportunities for breeding seabirds, particularly black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). Initially this closure seemed to be beneficial for kittiwakes with breeding success recovering to pre-fishery levels. However, despite the ban continuing, kittiwakes and many other seabird species in the North Sea suffered severe breeding failures in 2004. In this paper, we test the predictive power of four previously established correlations between kittiwake breeding success and climatic/trophic variables to explain the observed breeding success at the Isle of May in 2004. During the breeding season, kittiwakes at this colony switch from feeding on 1+ group to 0 group sandlance, and results up until 2003 indicated that availability of both age classes had a positive effect on kittiwake breeding success. The low breeding success of kittiwakes in 2004 was consistent with the late appearance and small body size of 0 group sandlance, but at odds with the two variables likely to operate via 1 group availability (lagged winter sea surface temperature and larval sandlance cohort strength in 2003). The reason for the discrepancy is currently unknown, but analysis of 1 group sandlance body composition indicated that lipid content in 2004 was extremely low, and thus fish eaten by kittiwakes during pre-breeding and early incubation were likely to be of poor quality. Monitoring of reproductive success of kittiwakes, although useful, was clearly not sufficient to tease apart the complex causation underlying the 2004 event. Monitoring programs such as this, therefore, need to be complemented by detailed research to identify the mechanisms involved, and to attribute and predict the effects of natural and human-induced environmental change. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Stable oxygen and carbon isotope measurements on biogenic calcite and aragonite have become standard tools for reconstructing past oceanographic and climatic change. In aquatic organisms, 18O/16O ratios in the shell carbonate are a function of the ratio in the sea water and the calcification temperature1. In contrast, 13C/12C ratios are controlled by the ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon in sea water and physiological processes such as respiration and symbiont photosynthesis2. These geochemical proxies have been used with analyses of foraminifera shells to reconstruct global ice volumes3, surface and deep ocean temperatures4,5, ocean circulation changes6 and glacial–interglacial exchange between the terrestrial and oceanic carbon pools7. Here, we report experimental measurements on living symbiotic and non-symbiotic plankton foraminifera (Orbulina universa and Globigerina bulloides respectively) showing that the 13C/12C and 18O/16O ratios of the calcite shells decrease with increasing seawater [CO32-]. Because glacial-period oceans had higher pH and [CO32-] than today8, these new relationships confound the standard interpretation of glacial foraminiferal stable-isotope data. In particular, the hypothesis that the glacial–interglacial shift in the 13C/12C ratio was due to a transfer of terrestrial carbon into the ocean7 can be explained alternatively by an increase in ocean alkalinity25. A carbonate-concentration effect could also help explain some of the extreme stable-isotope variations during the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic aeons9.},

abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 fluctuations over glacial–interglacial cycles remain a major challenge to our understanding of the carbon cycle and the climate system. Leading hypotheses put forward to explain glacial– interglacial atmospheric CO2 variations invoke changes in deep-ocean carbon storage, probably modulated by processes in the Southern Ocean, where much of the deep ocean is ventilated. A central aspect of such models is that, during deglaciations, an isolated glacial deep ocean carbon reservoir is reconnected with the atmosphere, driving the atmospheric CO2 rise observed in ice-core records. However, direct documentation of changes in surface ocean carbon contentand the associated transfer of carbon to the atmosphere during deglaciations has been hindered by the lack of proxy reconstructions that unambiguously reflect the oceanic carbonate system. Radiocarbon activity tracks changes in ocean ventilation, but not in ocean carbon content, whereas proxies that record increased deglacial upwelling do not constrain the proportion of upwelled carbon that is degassed relative to that which is taken up by the biological pump. Here we apply the boron isotope pH proxy in planktic foraminifera to two sediment cores from the sub-Antarctic, Atlantic and the eastern equatorial Pacific as a more direct tracer of oceanic CO2 outgassing. We show that surface waters at both locations, which partly derive from deep water upwelled in the Southern Ocean, became a significant source of carbon to the atmosphere during the last deglaciation, when the concentration of atmospheric CO2 was increasing. This oceanic CO2 outgassing supports the view that the ventilation of a deep-ocean carbon reservoir in the Southern Ocean had a key role in the deglacial CO2 rise, although our results allow for the possibility that processes operating in other regions may also have been important for the glacial–interglacial ocean–atmosphere exchange of carbon.},

abstract = {We investigate the evolution of Cenozoic climate and ice volume as evidenced by the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater (??18Osw) derived from benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios to constrain the temperature effect contained in foraminiferal ??18O values. We have constructed two benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca records from intermediate water depth sites (Ocean Drilling Program sites 757 and 689 from the subtropical Indian Ocean and the Weddell Sea, respectively). Together with the previously published composite record of Lear et al. [Science 287 (2002) 269-272] and the Neogene record from the Southern Ocean of Billups and Schrag [Paleoceanography 17 (2002) 10.1029/2000PA000567], we obtain three, almost complete representations of the ??18Osw for the past 52 Myr. We discuss the sensitivity of early Cenozoic Mg/Ca-derived paleotemperatures (and hence the ??18Osw) to assumptions about seawater Mg/Ca ratios. We find that during the middle Eocene (???49-40 Ma), modern seawater ratios yield Mg/Ca-derived Mg/Ca-derived temperatures that are in good agreement with the oxygen isotope paleothermometer assuming ice-free conditions. Intermediate waters cooled during the middle Eocene reaching minimum temperatures by 40 Ma. The corresponding ??18Osw reconstructions support ice growth on Antarctica beginning by at least 40 Ma. At the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, Mg/Ca ratios (and hence temperatures) from Weddell Sea site 689 display a well-defined maximum. We caution against a paleoclimatic significance of this result and put forth that the partitioning coefficient of Mg in benthic foraminifera may be sensitive to factors other than temperature. Throughout the remainder of the Cenozoic, the temporal variability among ??18O sw records is similar and similar to longer-term trends in the benthic foraminiferal ??18O record. An exception occurs during the Pliocene when ??18Osw minima in two of the three recor ds suggest reductions in global ice volume that are not apparent in foraminiferal ??18O records, which provides a new perspective to the ongoing debate about the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet. Maximum ??18Osw values recorded during the Pleistocene at Southern Ocean site 747 agree well with values derived from the geochemistry of pore waters [Schrag et al., Science 272 (1996) 1930-1932] further highlighting the value of the new Mg/Ca calibrations of Martin et al. [Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 198 (2002) 193-209] and Lear et al. [Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 66 (2002) 3375-3387] applied in this study. We conclude that the application of foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios allows a refined view of Cenozoic ice volume history despite uncertainties related to the geochemical cycling of Mg and Ca on long time scales. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AP activity strongly correlated with cellular P, increasing almost linearly with decreasing cellular P in both species.

We performed molecular simulations with quantitatively accurate models and observed that the order K(+) {\textless} Na(+) {\textless} Li(+) of increasing binding affinity with carboxylate ions is caused by a stronger preference for forming weak solvent-shared ion pairs. The relative insignificance of contact pair interactions with protein surfaces indicates that thermodynamic stability and interactions between proteins in alkali salt solutions is governed by interactions mediated through hydration water molecules.},

abstract = {Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is a precursor phase of calcite in the formation of the sea urchin larval spicule. The goal of this research is to study the formation and stabilization mode of this transient phase. We first characterized the mineralogy of the spicules from the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. We then examined the role of the macromolecules extracted from the spicules at different growth stages in the formation of transient ACC in vitro. The biogenic amorphous transient phase is shown to be both structurally and compositionally different from the known stable ACC phases. It does not contain bound water, and is thus the first dehydrated ACC phase to be detected. The macromolecules that were extracted at early stages of spicule growth, when the amorphous content of the biogenic mineral is high, induced the formation of transient ACC in vitro in the presence of magnesium ions. In contrast, the macromolecules extracted at a later stage, when the spicules are completely crystalline, induced the formation of single crystals of low magnesian calcite. We therefore deduce that the macromolecules from the sea urchin larval spicules together with magnesium ions, mediate the transient formation of ACC as a precursor to calcite. These observations may well provide novel ideas for improved materials synthesis.},

abstract = {We determined the stable oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of live (Rose Bengal stained) benthic foraminifera ({\textgreater} 150 ??m size fraction) of seven taxa sampled along a downslope transect between 140 to 2000 m water depth in the Bay of Biscay. At the five stations, Hoeglundina elegans, Cibicidoides pachydermus, Uvigerina peregrina, Uvigerina mediterranea preferentially occupy shallow infaunal niches, whereas Melonis barleeanus and Uvigerina elongatastriata occupy an intermediate infaunal microhabitat, and Globobulimina spp. live in a deep infaunal niche close to the zero oxygen boundary. When compared with ??18O values of calcite formed in equilibrium with bottom waters, U. peregrina forms its test in close equilibrium with bottom water ??18O. All other foraminiferal taxa calcify with a constant offset to calculated equilibrium calcite. There is no systematic relationship between the foraminiferal microhabitat depth and the ????18O between foraminiferal and equilibrium calcite. We calculated correcting factors for the various taxa, which are needed for constructing multispecies-based oxygen isotope records in paleoceanographic studies of the study area. The ??13C values of foraminiferal taxa investigated in this study do neither record bottom water ??13CDIC in a 1: 1 relationship nor with a constant offset, but appear to be mainly controlled by microhabitat effects. The increase of ??13C values of shallow infaunal taxa with increasing water depth reflects the decrease of the exported flux of organic carbon along the bathymetric transect and early diagenetic processes in the surface sediment. This is particularly the case for the shallow infaunal U. peregrina. The ??13C values of deep infaunal Globobulimina spp. are much less dependent on the exported organic matter flux. We suggest that the ????13C between U. peregrina and Globobulimina spp. can shed light on the various pathways of past degradation of organic detritus in the benthic environments. At a station in 550 m water depth, where periodic eutrophication of sediment surface niches was demonstrated previously, we performed a two-year seasonal survey of the isotopic composition of foraminiferal faunas. No marked seasonal changes of the stable carbon isotopic composition of shallow, intermediate and deep infaunal foraminiferal taxa were observed. Thus, the ??13C values of foraminiferal individuals belonging to the {\textgreater} 150 ??m fraction may result from rather long-term calcification processes lasting for several weeks or months, which limit the impact of ephemeral 12C enrichment of shallow infaunal niches on the isotope chemistry of adult individuals during eutrophic periods. Only highly opportunistic taxa reproducing or calcifying during phytoplankton bloom periods and the subsequent deposits of phytoplankton remains in the benthic environment may exhibit a particularly low ??13C, indicative of such short productive periods. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent research suggests that public attitudes toward emerging technologies are mainly driven by trust in the institutions promoting and regulating these technologies. Alternative views maintain that trust should be seen as a consequence rather than a cause of such attitudes. To test its actual role, direct as well as mediating effects of trust were tested in an attitude change experiment involving 1,405 consumers from Denmark, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. After prior attitudes to genetic modification in food production had been assessed, participants received different information materials (either product-specific information or balanced/general information about genetic modification in food production) and were asked to evaluate different types of genetically modified foods (either beer or yoghurt). The information materials were attributed to different information sources (either an industry association, a consumer organization, or a government source). After completion, perceived risk and perceived benefit were assessed, and participants indicated their trust in the information sources to which the materials had been attributed. Direct and trust-mediated attitude change effects were estimated in a multi-sample structural equation model. The results showed that information provision had little effect on people's attitudes toward genetically modified foods, and that perceptions of information source characteristics contributed very little to attitude change. Furthermore, the type of information strategy adopted had almost no impact on postexperimental attitudes. The extent to which people trusted the information sources appeared to be driven by people's attitudes to genetically modified foods, rather than trust influencing the way that people reacted to the information. Trust was not driving risk perception2014rather, attitudes were informing perceptions of the motivation of the source providing the information.},

abstract = {In simulation studies of the ocean's role in the global carbon cycle, predicting the depth-distribution for remineralization of particulate organic carbon (POC) is of particular importance. Following Sarmiento et al. (Global Biogeochemical Cycles 7 (1993) 417), most simulation models have the power-law curve of Martin et al. (Deep-Sea Research 34 (1987) 267) for this purpose. The Martin et al. curve is an empirical fit to data, most of which is from shallow floating sediment traps. Using such a fit implies that all the information necessary for prediction is contained in the carbon flux itself, so that the organic-carbon flux Foc(z) at any depth z can be predicted from the flux of organic carbon Foc(z0) at some near-surface depth z0. Here, we challenge this basic premise, arguing that fluxes of ballast minerals (silicate and carbonate biominerals, and dust) determine deep-water POC fluxes, so that a mechanism-based model of POC flux must simultaneously predict fluxes of both POC and ballast minerals. This assertion is based on the empirical observation that POC fluxes are tightly linked quantitatively to fluxes of ballast minerals in the deep ocean. Here, we develop a model structure that incorporates this observation, and fit this model to US JGOFS EqPac data. This model structure, plus the preliminary parameter estimates we have obtained, can be used to explore the implications of our model in studies of the ocean carbon cycle. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Shell-weight measurements were carried out on planktonic foraminifera G. sacculifer and G. ruber specimens from coretop depth transects in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Ocean to investigate calcite dissolution above the lysocline. The results suggest that foraminifera deposited in sediments overlain by supersaturated bottom water undergo considerable dissolution at the sediment-water interface and that the calcite saturation state at the interface is considerably offset from that of bottom water. Also, the extent of exposure to undersaturated conditions at the interface is not constant. Rather, it increases towards the surface ocean, i.e. towards shallow marine sediments where the organic matter flux is expected to be higher. It is proposed that the benthic fluff layer at the sediment-water interface represents a zone of undersaturation through which the foraminifera pass prior to deeper burial, and that the residence time of foraminifera within this zone of intense organic matter respiration is long enough to result in significant decreases in shell weight. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Coral reefs are subject to a high frequency of recurrent biological and physical disturbances. The temporal and spatial scales of these are often large and difficult to study, so that most of our knowledge of disturbances on coral reefs comes from investigations conducted at one or a few sites, over shea periods of time. We argue that studying single events in isolation can be misleading and that a longer term approach is necessary for understanding the responses of coral reef assemblages to multiple stressors. We present first a brief review of the impacts of physical disturbance (e.g., cyclones, hurricanes) on the community dynamics of coral reefs, with special attention to the effects of recurrent events. We then examine two unusually detailed, long-term data sets from Heron Island, Australia, and Jamaica which demonstrate some of the complexities of multiple stressors (broadly defined as natural or man-made disturbances). Both case studies illustrate that the effect of a particular disturbance often depends critically on the impact of previous perturbations. Consequently, even the same type of recurrent stressor can have different effects at different times, depending on history. Accordingly, when the added dimension of time is considered, the distinction between single and multiple stressors becomes blurred. Even a single event such as a hurricane can be viewed mechanistically as a multiple stressor, with short- and long-term impacts. We emphasize that multiple stressors often have significant effects on recruitment and regenerative processes of assemblages. These impacts are much less obvious than catastrophic or chronic mortality, but they play a crucial role in community dynamics over longer time scales. Importantly, chronic anthropogenic impacts can impede the ability of coral assemblages to recover from natural disasters, even where there is little detectable effect on rates of adult mortality. Once a reef has been degraded, it is usually impossible to ascertain retrospectively the precise mechanisms that were involved or the relative importance of different events. A single survey will provide a snapshot of the status of coral reefs, but a longer term approach is required to understand the processes underlying changes in assemblages.},

Calcium phosphate deposition on porous and dense (non-porous) chitosan membranes treated or not with PAA has been studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction, potentiometric titration and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). The experiments were carried out by soaking chitosan membranes in simulated body fluids (SBF), 1.0 and 1.5 times the human serum salt concentration, at 36.5 ??C during 7 days at pH 7.4 or 7.8. SEM micrographs showed that the use of these growth solutions resulted in substrates with significant coverage with calcium phosphate. PAA led to a higher coverage even at lower pH (7.4), but the morphological and chemical nature of deposits was remarkably different if compared to deposits on pure chitosan membranes. Although PAA has shown to promote a more intense deposition, probably by offering ion-binding sites adequate for nucleation, it does not necessarily determine a well-defined crystal growth orientation. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In natural waters, the sediment-water interface is the site where gradients in physical, chemical and biological properties are the greatest. Both chemical and microbiological transformation processes are responsible for cycling elements between water and sediments. This paper discusses the various chemical transformations that take place during early diagenesis in sediments, and which are fueled by supply rates of organic carbon and electron acceptors. In particular, our current knowledge of the cycling of the electron acceptors O, N, Mn, Fe and S is assessed, and the important role of transport reactions is described. The elemental fluxes across the sediment-water interface can be described from first principles only if the coupling of physical, chemical and biological processes is better understood. Large gradients in chemical potentials of many chemical species across this interface often lead to steep gradients in proton and electron activities. The redox sequence commonly observed in time and space also leads to changes in the partitioning of solutes between carrier and solution phases. Such processes can cause rapid back-diffusion of released species to the overlying water column or their removal onto secondary carrier phases within the sediments. Physical transport systems such as resuspension or bioturbation of particles control the physical boundary conditions for chemical reactions immediately above or below the sediment-water interface. Because of the complex coupling of the different chemical, physical and biological processes, chemical reactions within this region must be considered an integral part of a three-dimensional network of interactions. Hence, the apparent coexistence of chemical species considered 'incompatible' by thermodynamic models can be a consequence of the three-dimensional nature of redox gradients. The microbiological, chemical and physical interactions of dissolved, colloidal and particulate organic carbon, and iron and manganese oxides play a crucial role in the early diagenetic reactions at the sediment-water interface. Their effects on diagenetic reactions, and on trace elements in solution and adsorbed to particles, are discussed. Furthermore, we emphasize the way in which hydrodynamics can control elemental fluxes in environments with high carbon rain rates. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

Electron microscopy observations revealed previously undescribed morphological features of the cell that are important for species recognition. The presence of a single elongated apical vesicle (EAV) ornamented with a row of small knobs, absent in species of the genus Gymnodinium, calls into question the current taxonomic position of the symbiont. The presence of a type E extraplastidial eyespot, the arrangement of the amphiesmal vesicles in series and the absence of trichocysts confirm the affiliation with other symbiotic dinoflagellates and certain genetically related non-symbiotic genera, all belonging to the order Suessiales. The arrangement of the series of vesicles of the analyzed strain is unique within the Suessiales, and the ultrastructure of the pyrenoid is different from other symbiotic dinoflagellates. A large subunit (LSU) rDNA phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the analyzed pelagic symbiont clusters in an independent, well-supported clade within the Suessiales with other sequences of symbiotic dinoflagellates extracted from planktonic foraminifera. Hence a novel genus, Pelagodinium gen. nov., is erected for this pelagic, symbiotic dinoflagellate, and Gymnodinium b??ii is reclassified as Pelagodinium b??ii. ?? 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

Our observations in McMurdo Sound suggest temporally and trophically cascading impacts of that depression in productivity. Reduced phytoplankton stocks clearly affected the pteropod Limacina helicina (Phipps, 1774) (Gastropoda: Mollusca), an abundant primary consumer in the region (2, 3), as indicated by depressed metabolic rates in 2000-2001. The following season, for the first time on record, L. helicina was absent from McMurdo Sound. Many important predators, including whales and fishes, rely heavily on L. helicina for food (3, 4). However, most obviously impacted by its absence was Clione antarctica (Smith, 1902), an abundant pteropod mollusc (Gastropoda) that feeds exclusively on L. helicina (5). Metabolic rates of C. antarctica were depressed by 50{\%} in 2001-2002. Both L. helicina and C. antarctica are important components Of polar ecosystems and may be good indicators of overall ecosystem "health" in McMurdo Sound and perhaps in the Ross Sea.

abstract = {There is a need for the quantitative determination of the ternary mixtures of calcium carbonate polymorphs (calcite, aragonite and vaterite), which are present in a number of materials including limestones, industrial scale formation and several pathological cases. Application of infrared spectroscopy proved to be inadequate, due to band overlapping, while use of Raman spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) has been reported only for the calcite–aragonite mixture. In order to address the problem, a comprehensive non-destructive methodology for the simultaneous quantitative determination of the calcium carbonate crystal phases in their ternary mixtures based on the use of Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy (FT-RS) was developed. Binary mixtures were used to construct the calibration graphs using the Raman bands at 711 cm−1 for calcite, 700 cm−1 for aragonite and 750 cm−1 for vaterite. Detection limits were found to be 0.13, 0.18 and 1.3 mol.-{\%} for calcite, aragonite and vaterite, respectively, while the relative errors in determining the mol.-{\%} of a known ternary mixture of calcium carbonate polymorphs were 1.6{\%} for calcite, 0.3{\%} for aragonite and 1.1{\%} for vaterite. A similar methodology was developed using XRD. XRD calibration graphs were constructed using the 104 reflection of calcite, the 221 reflection of aragonite and the 110 reflection of vaterite. Detection limits for calcite, aragonite and vaterite were found to be 0.90, 2.90 and 6.90 mol.-{\%}, respectively, while the relative errors in determining the mol.-{\%} of the same ternary mixture used for testing the FT-RS methodology were 2.5, 1.8 and 0.6{\%}, for calcite, aragonite and vaterite, respectively.},

Fly brains were analyzed frozen to prevent molecular redistribution prior to analysis. Different molecules were found to distribute differently in the tissue, particularly the eye pigments, diacylglycerides, and phospholipids, and this is expected to be driven by their biological functions in the brain. Correlations in the localization of these molecules were also observed using principal components analysis of image data, and this was used to identify peaks for further analysis. Furthermore, consecutive analyses following 10 keV Ar2500 + sputtering showed that different biomolecules respond differently to Ar2500 + sputtering.

abstract = {Interannual variability of nutrients and plankton cycles were studied at the time-series station KERFIX (50??40'S, 68??25'E) using a 1-D coupled physical-biogeochemical model that is descended from that of Pondaven et al. (1998). At KERFIX, a high half saturation constant for silicic acid uptake (K(Si)) and a high Si/N uptake ratio are required to reproduce the Si and N cycles. Although very high in comparison with most data from temperate systems, these values are consistent with K(Si) and Si/N uptake ratios measured in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Past and recent finding on the role of light and iron limitation on nutrient consumption ratios might explain these 'unusual' silicon uptake kinetic parameters. Comparison of model results with observations show that the model correctly reproduces the observed interannual variability of nutrients and plankton cycles at KERFIX between 1992 and 1995. Characteristic features of this region are a spring phytoplankton bloom of 1.0-1.5 mg Chlorophyll a m-3 and a net excess of silicic acid utilisation over that of nitrate. This high silicic acid utilisation leads to low Si concentrations in late summer and subsequent Si limitation of diatom growth. The interannual variability of production of silicon and nitrogen predicted by the model is 1.93 ?? 0.04 mol Si m-2 yr-1 and 1.35 ?? 0.07 mol N m-2 yr-1 (?? SD). In parallel, the predicted export is 1.12 ?? 0.04 mol Si m-2 yr-1 and 0.06 ?? 0.01 mol N m-2 yr-1. It is shown that diatoms may contribute significantly to export if diatom sinking is taken into account. An interannual variability of the predicted Si and N cycles is detected. This variability is associated with changes in the mixed layer properties, which have been documented to be linked to the Pacific El Nino Southern Oscillation or displacement of the Polar Front.},

abstract = {This paper describes a series of in vitro experiments during which juveniles of the euryhaline ostracod Cyprideis australiensis were grown to adulthood in waters of ranging salinities (from 10-70???.) and Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios, and under two different constant temperature regimes, 20??and 25??C. Results indicate the following thermodependence for Mg in the calcitic valves of adult Cyprideis australiensis: T(Mg) = 2.69 + 5230 x [Mg/Ca](ostracod)/[Mg/Ca](water). A minor thermodependence was also found for this ostracod species with respect to the uptake of Sr. There is a very strong relationship between the Mg/Ca of the ostracods and the Mg/Ca of the waters in which they moulted. The same can be said between the Sr/Ca of the ostracods and the waters' Sr/Ca. There is no direct relationship between water salinity and either the Mg/Ca ratio nor the Sr/Ca ratio of the ostracod valves. The 20??and 25??C experiments established the following partition coefficients which we believe can be applied to any Cyprideis taxa grown in waters within the 5 to 20 Mg/Ca range: K(D)[Mg] = -0.000514 + 0.00019 x Temperature ??C, and K(D)[Sr] = 0.223 + 0.0086 x Temperature ??C. This relationship for Sr, which has been mentioned for the first time for Cyprideis is tentative. The Mg/Ca of ostracods is strongly dependant on temperature, but this effect can easily be masked by variations in the Mg/Ca of the host water commonly found in natural lakes. Ostracod physiology is adapted to constructing valves from low-Mg calcite, so when growing in waters with high ({\textgreater}30), or very low ({\textless}1) Mg/Ca, Cyprideis species will not take up Mg in accordance with the calculated K(D).},

abstract = {Distribution coefficients, as a function of precipitation rate, were determined for the metals Sr2+, Co2+, Mn2+ and Cd2+in calcite. A pH-stat was used to maintain a constant degree of-saturation, and hence precipitation rate, during each coprecipitation run. The precipitation rate was proportional to the degree of supersaturation and the mass of seed crystal introduced. Distribution coefficients (??) as a function of rate were determined using radioactive isotopes for solutions with saturations ?? = 1 to ?? = 5.5. Strontium distribution coefficients increased with increasing precipitation rate, while Co, Mn and Cd distribution coefficients decreased with increasing precipitation rate. The following rate expressions (at 25??C) were derived: log ??Sr = 0.249 log R -1.57log ??Mn = -0.266 log R + 1.35log ??Co = -0.173 log R + 0.68log ??Cd = -0.194 log R + 1.46 where R is the observed precipitation rate in nmoles CaCO3 per mg seed crystal per min. In separate experiments the uptake of radioactive isotopes was monitored during the recrystallization of calcite seed crystals. Rates of recrystallization were from 100 to 10, 000 times slower than the pH-stat experiments, but yielded distribution coefficients consistent with the above rate expressions. Using gross estimates of biogenic crystal growth rates, aragonite to calcite transformation rates, and the above Sr rate expression, biogenic calcite and diagenetic calcite Sr contents are estimated. These experiments indicate that in addition to solution composition, precipitation rate is a significant factor influencing the trace metal content of naturally occurring calcite. ?? 1981.},

The d11B of corals culti- vated at both high and normal pCO2 conditions are consistent with a dominant pH control, and are very close to that calculated from theoretical considerations. Thus, the corals do not seem to significantly alter ambient seawater for calcification with respect to pH. Co-variation between boron and carbon isotope values is explored.},

abstract = {Standard scientific operations on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 204 documented a horizon of massive gas hydrate and highly saline pore water ∼0-20 m below the southern summit of Hydrate Ridge offshore Oregon. The sediment zone lies near active seafloor gas venting, raising the possibility that free gas co-exists with gas hydrate in shallow subsurface layers where pore waters have become too saline to precipitate additional gas hydrate. Here we discuss a unique experiment that addresses this important concept. A 1-m-long pressurized core was retrieved from ∼14 m below sea floor at Site 1249 and slowly degassed at ∼0 °C in the laboratory over ∼178 h to determine in situ salinity and gas concentrations in the interval of massive gas hydrate. The core released ∼95 l of gas (predominantly methane), by far the greatest gas volume ever measured for a 1 m core at ambient shipboard pressure and temperature conditions. Geochemical mass-balance calculations and the pressure of initial gas release (4.2 MPa) both imply that pore waters had an in situ salinity approaching or exceeding 105 g kg-1, the approximate salinity required for a gas hydrate-free gas-brine system. Relatively high concentrations of propane and higher hydrocarbon gases at the start of core degassing also suggest the presence of in situ free gas. Gas hydrate, free gas and brine likely co-exist in shallow sediment of Hydrate Ridge. Near-seafloor brines, produced when rapid gas hydrate crystallization extracts large quantities of water, impact the distribution and cycling of gas and gas hydrate in this region and perhaps elsewhere. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The utilization of inorganic carbon and role of the coccoliths were investigated in intact cells and protoplasts of a marine unicellular calcareous alga, Emiliania huxleyi. Protoplasts with high photosynthetic activity were obtained by artificial decalcification with 50 mM MES-NaOH (pH5.5). (1) The kinetics of the photosynthetic evolution of O2 at various concentrations of externally added NaHCO3 were the same for intact cells and protoplasts, indicating that the kinetic properties with respect to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were not affected by the presence or absence of the coccoliths on the cell surface. Double-reciprocal plots and plots of the concentration of substrate divided by velocity (s/v) against the concentration of substrate (s) were biphasic in the case of both intact cells and protoplasts. The CO2-utilization reaction was, therefore, considered to involve two processes with different values of Km and Vmax. From the kinetic analyses, Km and Vmax [{\{}micro{\}}moles O2 (ml PCV)-1 h-1] were deduced to be 92 {\{}micro{\}}M and 76.3 for a "low-Km" reaction and 4.1 mM and 252 for a "high-Km" reaction, respectively. (2) In short-term (40-min) experiments, time courses of the total uptake of 14C-DIC and the incorporation of 14C into acid-stable products of photosynthesis and the internal pool of DIC, determined as acid-labile compounds, under CO2-limiting conditions (80 {\{}micro{\}}M) were very similar for intact cells and protoplasts. However, incorporation of 14C into CaCO3 apparently occurred more slowly in protoplasts than in intact cells. (3) In long term (24-h) experiments, patterns of incorporation of 14C were almost same for intact cells and protoplasts, with the exception that the amount of 14C incorporated into CaCO3 was much smaller in the former than the latter. The production of Ca14CO3 increased during the course of 10 h after a 4-h lag. However, after 10 h the level of Ca14CCO3 started to decrease. The decrease was accompanied by an increase in 14C in the products of photosynthesis, suggesting that CaCO3 was reutilized for the photosynthetic fixation of CO2 and, therefore, that the coccoliths function as sites of storage of DIC. However, the internal level of DIC remained at the same level even after the supply of external DIC has been almost completely depleted.},

The partition coefficient is independent of precipitation rate over the range of rates tested. Our value of kBa2+calcite is substantially lower than that previously reported by Y. Kitano and coworkers. This is attributed to our seeding of the solutions with calcite to examine partitioning during calcite growth, rather than relying on spontaneous nucleation. The value of 0.06 for Ba is consistent with values reported for Sr (kSr2+calcite = 0.05 to 0.14) upon consideration of the radii of the respective divalent ions. The geologic behavior of Ba, as predicted for such a small partition coefficient, is consistent with observations of its preferential exclusion from natural diagenetic calcite relative to the parent aqueous solution. ?? 1984.},

abstract = {This paper extends the notion of spatial efficiency in the organization of social insect colonies. We demonstrate for the first time that ants (individually marked workers in three colonies of Leptothorax unifasciatus (Latr.)) are not only faithful to particular positions within the nest, but they also quickly readopt these positions, relative to one another, when the colony emigrates to an entirely new nest site. This phenomenon, which we term social resilience, has implications for the role of learning in the maintenance of an efficient division of labour to which, in part, the great ecological success of social insects has been attributed. As we demonstrate with observations of another three colonies over a period of six months, workers change their positions asynchronously and different age cohorts are intermingled. Thus the reconstruction of colony spatial order cannot be accounted for by age-based task allocation (i.e. age polyethism), as at any one time the colony meshwork represents a heterogeneous mixture of different generations. These findings also show that ant colonies have a much more precise spatial structure and greater cohesion than previously assumed, and demonstrates the importance of detailed quantitative examination of the sociogenesis or developmental biology of these societies.},

abstract = {We investigated the effects of human activities on the pelagic food web structure of nearshore marine ecosystems. Their generic structure was established on the basis of literature review and analyzed by qualitative structural network analysis. Two main issues were addressed: (1) the role of species capable of forming harmful algal blooms (HABs) and red tides (Noctiluca spp.), as well as the role of jellyfish, in eutrophicated systems; (2) the contribution of human influences on food webs, focusing on bottom-up (increased nutrient loading) and top-down (overfishing) effects. Results suggest that HAB-forming species and Noctiluca stimulate the microbial network, but reduce higher trophic levels such as commercially important fish species. Jellyfish act as a buffer in eutrophicated and overfished systems, as they retain nutrients from the water column, but their blooms lead to a massive accumulation of large phytoplankton organisms. Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment favors undesirable species because of their specific position in the food web, and this crucial position may explain their far-reaching effects. Finally, while it appears that overfishing of piscivorous fishes inhibited HABs and supported blooms of diatoms and other large algae in the past, the present-dal loss of planktivorous fishes acts synergistically with nutrient enrichment in promoting HAB species, Noctiluca and jellyfish. These fundamental constraints, which are inherent in the generic structure of pelagic food webs, thus largely determine community dynamics in marine coastal ecosystems.},

We apply the technique to sequences of satellite imagery acquired over the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet to derive changes in melt pond extent and volume during the period 2001–2004. Results show large intra- and interannual changes in ponded water volumes, and large volumes of liquid water stored in extensive slush zones.},

abstract = {PLANKTONIC bacteria are a fundamental component of the organic carbon cycle in aquatic systems(1). Organic carbon consumption by planktonic bacteria is the sum of bacterial production (BP) and bacterial respiration (BR), IL is now estimated that. 30-60{\%} of phytoplankton production (the amount of inorganic carbon fixed by phytoplankton photosynthesis, corrected far phytoplankton respiration) in marine and freshwater systems is processed by bacterial(1-3). These estimates of carbon flow through bacteria are conservative, however, because losses due to bacterial respiration are seldom directly measured(4,5). We report here that bacterial respiration is generally high, and tends to exceed phytoplankton net production in unproductive systems (less than 70 to 120 mu g carbon per litre per day). A large proportion of the world's aquatic systems have phytoplankton productivities below this value(6). Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) is the result of BP and BR[BGE = BP/(BR + BP)]. Comparisons of our models of bacterial respiration with published models of bacterial secondary production(1,7) show that bacterial growth efficiency must range fi om less than 10{\%} to 25{\%} in most freshwater and marine systems, well below the values commonly assumed in many current ecological models(1,2,8,9). The imbalance between bacterial respiration and phytoplankton production suggests that in unproductive aquatic systems, the biological system is a net source of CO2.},

abstract = {An extension of the seawater secular-variation model that successfully predicted the observed timing of Phanerozoic MgSO4 vs. KCl marine evaporites and aragonite seas vs. calcite seas has been applied to the prediction of the secular variations in the major ion chemistry of seawater and aragonite seas vs. calcite seas during the Precambrian. Testing of the predictions was based on those Precambrian seafloor carbonate precipitates that have been interpreted by others to have formed originally as aragonite. Of 16 examples of Precambrian seafloor aragonite, 14 fall within the 6 periods of aragonite seas predicted for the Late Archean-Proterozoic by the model, 1 falls on the transition between an aragonite sea and calcite sea, and 1 falls in a period of calcite seas. This strong correlation supports the following predictions of the model: (1) Precambrian seawater was a saline NaCl water with Ca {\textgreater} HCO3 since at least the Late Archean. (2) The major ion compositions of Precambrian seawater chemistry and their secular variations are in the same ranges as those of Phanerozoic seawater. (3) The Mg/Ca mole ratio in seawater has controlled the types of CaCO3 polymorphs that have precipitated from Earth's oceans throughout the Phanerozoic and most, if not all, of the Precambrian.},

abstract = {The metabolic costs of foraging and the management of O2 and CO2 stores during breath-hold diving was investigated in three female Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) trained to dive between 10 and 50 m (N=1142 dives). Each trial consisted of two to eight dives separated by surface intervals that were determined by the sea lion (spontaneous trials) or by the researcher (conditioned trials). During conditioned trials, surface intervals were long enough for O2 to return to pre-dive levels between each dive. The metabolic cost of each dive event (dive+surface interval; DMR) was measured using flow-through respirometry. The respiratory exchange ratio (VO2/VCO2) was significantly lower during spontaneous trials compared with conditioned trials. DMR was significantly higher during spontaneous trials and decreased exponentially with dive duration. A similar decrease in DMR was not as evident during conditioned trials. DMR could not be accurately estimated from the surface interval (SI) following individual dives that had short SIs ({\textless}50 s), but could be estimated on a dive by dive basis for longer SIs ({\textgreater}50 s). DMR decreased by 15{\%}, but did not differ significantly from surface metabolic rates (MRS) when dive duration increased from 1 to 7 min. Overall, these data suggest that DMR is almost the same as MRS, and that Steller sea lions incur an O2 debt during spontaneous diving that is not repaid until the end of the dive bout. This has important consequences in differentiating between the actual and 'apparent' metabolic rate during diving, and may explain some of the differences in metabolic rates reported in pinniped species.},

To extract the ice volume record, however, it is necessary to remove the temperature and local hydrological influence on ??18O. We employ the strategy of estimating calcification temperatures from Mg/Ca and removing this signal from an observed ??18O record of planktonic foraminifera from a core on the Cocos Ridge, eastern equatorial Pacific. The residual, ??18Owater, reveals a pattern of changes that appears to be consistent with known ice volume and sea level variations. Over the last four glacial terminations, ??18Owater decreases by 1,2??0.1???. The magnitude of high stands appears to be consistent with modern sea level during MIS 5.5 (5e), 7.1 and 7.5 but somewhat lower during MIS 9.1. The magnitude of low stands is similar (???-120m) for MIS 2.2 (LGM), 6.2, 8.2 and 10.2. The Cocos Ridge record also shows a period of intermediate sea level (???-30m) during MIS 6.5.

abstract = {The adsorption of surfactants (DTAB, SDS, and CAPB) at the calcite-water interface was studied through surface zeta potential measurements and multiscale molecular dynamics. The ground-state polarization of surfactants proved to be a key factor for the observed behavior; correlation was found between adsorption and the hard or soft charge distribution of the amphiphile. SDS exhibits a steep aggregation profile, reaching saturation and showing classic ionic-surfactant behavior. In contrast, DTAB and CAPB featured diversified adsorption profiles, suggesting interplay between supramolecular aggregation and desorption from the solid surface and alleviating charge buildup at the carbonate surface when bulk concentration approaches CMC. This manifests as an adsorption profile with a fast initial step, followed by a metastable plateau and finalizing with a sharp decrease and stabilization of surface charge. Suggesting this competition of equilibria, elicited at the CaCO3 surface, this study provides atomistic insight into the adsorption mechanism for ionic surfactants on calcite, which is in accordance with experimental evidence and which is a relevant criterion for developing enhanced oil recovery processes.},

abstract = {[1] The stable boron isotope composition (delta(11)B) of fossil foraminiferal shells is used as a paleo-pH recorder and is therefore one of the most promising paleocarbonate chemistry proxies ("paleoacidimetry''). One crucial question regarding this proxy is whether foraminifera record the pH of the bulk seawater or the pH of the microenvironment ( diffusive boundary layer, similar to500 mum), which is strongly influenced by life processes. Here we present a novel theoretical approach to address this question by using a diffusion-reaction model. Model results indicate that the delta(11)B in planktonic foraminifera is primarily controlled by the pH of the microenvironment. We therefore predict that the delta(11)B of different species ( e. g., symbiont-bearing versus symbiont-barren) or of foraminifera grown in the dark and in the light should be offset from the delta(11)B of inorganic calcite. This theoretical prediction was experimentally confirmed while this paper was written [ Honisch et al., 2003]. Most importantly, the model predicts that this offset is constant over a wide pH range. Thus the use of delta(11)B as a paleo-pH indicator is not compromised through vital effects as modeled here.},

abstract = {A long-standing question in Paleogene climate concerns the frequency and mechanism of transient greenhouse gas-driven climate shifts (hyperthermals). The discovery of the greenhouse gas-driven Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ??? 55??Ma) has spawned a search for analogous events in other parts of the Paleogene record. On the basis of high-resolution bulk sediment and foraminiferal stable isotope analyses performed on three lower Danian sections of the Atlantic Ocean, we report the discovery of a possible greenhouse gas-driven climatic event in the earliest Paleogene. This event - that we term the Dan-C2 event - is characterized by a conspicuous double negative excursion in ??13C and ??18O, associated with a double spike in increased clay content and decreased carbonate content. This suggests a double period of transient greenhouse gas-driven warming and dissolution of carbonates on the seafloor analogous to the PETM in the early Paleocene at ??? 65.2??Ma. However, the shape of the two negative carbon isotope excursions that make up the Dan-C2 event is different from the PETM carbon isotope profile. In the Dan-C2 event, these excursions are fairly symmetrical and each persisted for about ??? 40??ky and are separated by a short plateau that brings the combined duration to ??? 100??ky, suggesting a possible orbital control on the event. Because of the absence of a long recovery phase, we interpret the Dan-C2 event to have been associated with a redistribution of carbon that was already in the biosphere. The Dan-C2 event and other early Paleogene hyperthermals such as the short-lived early Eocene ELMO event may reflect amplification of a regular cycle in the size and productivity of the marine biosphere and the balance between burial of organic and carbonate carbon. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A surface reaction kinetic model is developed for predicting Ca isotope fractionation and metal/Ca ratios of calcite as a function of rate of precipitation from aqueous solution. The model is based on the requirements for dynamic equilibrium; i.e. proximity to equilibrium conditions is determined by the ratio of the net precipitation rate (Rp) to the gross forward precipitation rate (Rf), for conditions where ionic transport to the growing crystal surface is not rate-limiting. The value of Rp has been experimentally measured under varying conditions, but the magnitude of Rf is not generally known, and may depend on several factors. It is posited that, for systems with no trace constituents that alter the surface chemistry, Rf can be estimated from the bulk far-from-equilibrium dissolution rate of calcite (Rb or kb), since at equilibrium Rf=Rb, and Rp=0. Hence it can be inferred that Rf???Rp+Rb. The dissolution rate of pure calcite is measureable and is known to be a function of temperature and pH. At given temperature and pH, equilibrium precipitation is approached when Rp (=Rf-Rb)???Rb. For precipitation rates high enough that Rp???Rb, both isotopic and trace element partitioning are controlled by the kinetics of ion attachment to the mineral surface, which tend to favor more rapid incorporation of the light isotopes of Ca and discriminate weakly between trace metals and Ca. With varying precipitation rate, a transition region between equilibrium and kinetic control occurs near Rp???Rb for Ca isotopic fractionation. According to this model, Ca isotopic data can be used to estimate Rf for calcite precipitation. Mechanistic models for calcite precipitation indicate that the molecular exchange rate is not constant at constant T and pH, but rather is dependent also on solution saturation state and hence Rp. Allowing Rb to vary as Rp1/2, consistent with available precipitation rate studies, produces a better fit to some trace element and isotopic data than a model where Rb is constant. This model can account for most of the experimental data in the literature on the dependence of 44Ca/40Ca and metal/Ca fractionation in calcite as a function of precipitation rate and temperature, and also accounts for 18O/16O variations with some assumptions. The apparent temperature dependence of Ca isotope fractionation in calcite may stem from the dependence of Rb on temperature; there should be analogous pH dependence at pH{\textless}6. The proposed model may be valuable for predicting the behavior of isotopic and trace element fractionation for a range of elements of interest in low-temperature aqueous geochemistry. The theory presented is based on measureable thermo-kinetic parameters in contrast to models that require hyper-fast diffusivity in near-surface layers of the solid. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Spontaneous formation of locally ordered patterns during dewetting of thin films on homogeneous and heterogeneous substrates is investigated based on the 3-D nonlinear equation of motion. Physicochemical heterogeneities engender the rapid formation of the primary holes that serve as "seeds" for the formation of locally ordered structures. The secondary multiring structure surrounding the primary hole evolves by one of the following two different pathways depending on the film thickness vis-{\`{a}}-vis the location of the minimum in the spinodal curve: (A) Thick films evolve by the formation of secondary satellite holes that originate from a ring-like depression behind the rim of the primary hole. The process of ordering is repeated until the true spinodal holes appear on the remaining substrate. (B) Ordering in a relatively thin film occurs by the formation of droplets caused by the disintegration of the elevated rim that surrounds the primary hole. The radial distance between the successive ordered layers is close to the spinodal length scale, lambda(m). Droplets within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly greater than lambda(m), whereas holes within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly less than lambda(m). The number density of holes or droplets in the ordered pattern is of the same order as the predictions of the spinodal theory. The number of ordered layers and the size of the locally ordered domain depend significantly on the relative magnitudes of the time scales for the following events: (1) formation of the primary hole, (2) growth of holes (inverse of hole-growth velocity), (3) formation of a secondary feature (hole or droplet) adjacent to the primary hole, (4) true spinodal rupture far from the primary hole. The morphology of an ordered structure can therefore be tailored by modulation of the film thickness and the short- and long-range intermolecular interactions (substrate surface properties), since these affect the time scales 1 to 4 in different ways.},

The foraminifera were obtained from Ashley Mudstone, mid-Waipara River, South Island, which was deposited at bathyal depth (ca. 1000m) on the northern margin of the east-facing Canterbury Basin at a paleo-latitude of ca. 55??S. LA-ICP-MS data yield trace element depth profiles through foraminifera test walls that can be used to identify and exclude zones of surficial contamination and infilling material resulting from diagenetic coatings, mineralisation and detrital sediment. Screened Mg/Ca ratios from 5 species of foraminifera are used to calculate sea temperatures from late Early to early Middle Eocene (ca. 51 to 46.5Ma), a time interval that spans the termination of the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO). During this time, sea surface temperatures (SST) varied from 30 to 24??C, and bottom water temperatures (BWT) from 21 to 14??C. Comparison of Mg/Ca sea temperatures with published ??18O and TEX86 temperature data from the same samples (Hollis et al., 2009) shows close correspondence, indicating that LA-ICP-MS can provide reliable Mg/Ca sea temperatures even where foraminiferal test preservation is variable. Agreement between the three proxies also implies that Mg/Ca-temperature calibrations for modern planktonic and benthic foraminifera can generally be applied to Eocene species, although some species (e.g., V. marshalli) show significant calibration differences. The Mg/Ca ratio of the Eocene ocean is constrained by our data to be 35-50{\%} lower than the modern ocean depending on which TEX86 - temperature calibration (Kim et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009) - is used to compare with the Mg/Ca sea temperatures. Sea temperatures derived from ??18O analysis of foraminifera from Waipara show amplified variability relative to the Mg/Ca and TEX86 proxies. This amplified variability is probably a diagenetic effect although it is possible that this Eocene ??18O record contains an ice volume component - the amplification signalling that temperature changes may have been accompanied by growth and collapse of ephemeral polar ice sheets on timescales of ca. 0.5Myr. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, we present a method that can successfully produce sections (lamellas in FIB-SEM terminology) of fully hydrated, unstained cells from high-pressure frozen samples by focused ion beam (FIB) milling. The samples are therefore placed in thin copper tubes and vitrified by high-pressure freezing. For transfer, handling and subsequent milling, the tubes are placed in a novel connective device (ferrule) that protects the sample from devitrification and contamination and passes through all operation steps. A piezo driven sample positioning stage (cryo-nano-bench, CNB) with three degrees of freedom was additionally developed to enable accurate milling of frozen-hydrated lamellas.With the CNB, high-pressure frozen samples can be milled to produce either thin lamellas ({\textless}100. nm), for direct imaging by high-resolution cryo-TEM or thicker lamellas (300-500. nm) for cryo-electron tomography. The sample remains vitreous throughout the process by using the presented tools and methods. The results are an important step towards investigating larger cells and even tissue in there natural state which in the end will enable us to gain better insights into cellular processes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The recent discovery of photosynthetic picoplankton has changed our understanding of marine food webs1. Both prokaryotic2,3 and eukaryotic4,5 species occur in most of the world's oceans and account for a significant proportion of global productivity6. Using shipboard flow cytometry, we have identified a new group of picoplankters which are extremely abundant, and barely visible using traditional microscopic techniques. These cells are smaller than the coccoid cyanobacteria and reach concentrations greater than 105 cells ml–1 in the deep euphotic zone. They fluoresce red and contain a divinyl chlorophyll a-like pigment, as well as chlorophyll b, alpha-carotene, and zeaxanthin. This unusual combination of pigments, and a distinctive prokaryotic ultrastructure, suggests that these picoplankters are free-living relatives of Prochloron7. They differ from previously reported prochlorophytes—the putative ancestors of the chloroplasts of higher plants—in that they contain alpha-carotene rather than beta-carotene and contain a divinyl chlorophyll a-like pigment as the dominant chlorophyll.},

abstract = {* 1Organic farming is thought to lead to increased biodiversity and greater sustainability than higher-yielding conventional farming systems. It is usually assumed that organic farms have both larger and higher quality areas of semi-natural habitats, although this assumption has not been unequivocally tested. * 2Here we test the hypothesis that in comparison to conventional farms, organic farms have larger areas of semi-natural and boundary vegetation, and organic farms support higher levels of plant abundance, richness and diversity within cropped and semi-natural areas. * 3Our study compared whole-farms: 10 organic farms were paired with 10 conventional farms in a complex landscape in the south-west of England. On average, organic farms were 7{\textperiodcentered}3 years post conversion. Plant abundance, species richness and diversity were measured in all crop and non-crop landscape elements on each farm. * 4Organic farms had greater total areas of semi-natural habitat (woodland, field margins and hedgerows combined). Woodland area on it's own was also significantly greater. Organic farms had more continuous blocks of woodland (with simpler perimeters than similarly sized patches on conventional farms), whereas woodland on conventional farms often consisted of more linear patches. * 5Semi-natural habitats on organic farms did not have higher plant abundance, richness or diversity than their conventional counterparts. The only landscape element that showed a significant increase in plant abundance, richness or diversity was arable fields. * 6Synthesis and applications. Even within a complex agricultural landscape differences do exist between organic and conventional farms, these differences being larger areas of semi-natural habitats on organic farms. However, with the exception of arable fields, no habitats on organic farms were yet of a better quality than their conventional counterparts in terms of plant abundance and diversity. Conventional farmers may be able to achieve an increase in plant diversity within arable fields by adopting some organic management practices at the field scale (e.g. exclusion of synthetic herbicides), and whole-farm conversion to organic practice might not be required. However, further work is needed to determine any biodiversity benefits of larger areas of semi-natural habitat on conventional farmland.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal systems are a common feature of active collisional orogens. These systems can have a profound effect on the Sr fluxes and Sr isotopic composition of riverine waters through the direct input of Sr from hot springs and groundwaters and the chemical weathering of hydrothermal calcite. In an effort to quantify the role of calcite weathering we present an analytical model that examines the relationship between rock uplift and steady-state chemical weathering of granites and greywackes that contain trace amounts ({\textless} 3{\%}) of calcite. We also tested the affect of different mineral dissolution rates and production of secondary minerals on Sr fluxes. This model predicts that in areas of high rock uplift such as collisional mountain belts as much as 60{\%} of the Sr released during chemical weathering comes from the weathering of small amounts of hydrothermal calcite. Moreover, the Sr isotopic composition of weathered material remains constant over a wide range of tectonic environments and is insensitive to the proportion of calcite to silicate weathering. As such, the Sr isotopic composition of river waters will not be an adequate proxy for silicate weathering in tectonically active orogens if calcite is present, and it is these very orogens that have the highest chemical weathering rates. We compare model results with Sr fluxes and isotopic composition of riverine waters from the Southern Alps of New Zealand, an area that is frequently used as an example of a steady-state collisional orogen. As our model predicts, roughly 50{\%} of Sr flux is from the weathering of calcite in the areas of highest uplift along the west-flank of the Southern Alps. This proportion decreases substantially ({\textless} 20{\%} from calcite) in the areas of lower uplift east of the Southern Alps. Because chemical weathering rates are approximately a factor of two higher in the rapidly uplifting areas as compared to the more stable regions a significant portion of strontium flux from rivers on South Island of New Zealand is from the weathering of calcite. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Biomineralization is an inherently structural subject; the structure of the mineral phase, the structure of the matrix composed of macromolecules and especially the structure of the interphase zone between them. Studies of the dynamics of mineral formation have revealed that a widespread strategy used by many organisms is to first form a disordered mineral phase. Only when it is in place and has adopted its appropriate shape, is it induced to crystallize. Matrix studies have highlighted the importance of a unique group of proteins that are rich in aspartic acid. These are involved in controlling mineral formation. Relating structure to function in mineralized tissues, often involves an understanding of mechanical properties in terms of not only the hierarchical structure of the tissue, but also the graded structure that varies from one location to another. Structure is thus in many respects the foundation upon which the field of biomineralization rests. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study investigates $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O variations in the shells of modern brachiopods representing all extant groups of calcite-precipitating brachiopods, collected live from 8 locations. SEM examinations determined the ultrastructural characteristics of each species prior to isotope analyses. $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O analyses of shell carbonate were carried out with samples representing disparate morphological features and ultrastructural shell layers of both ventral and dorsal valves. Generally, $\delta$18O values from the fibrous secondary or prismatic tertiary shell layers of the articulated Terebratulida and Rhynchonellida species were in oxygen isotopic equilibrium with ambient seawater. Isotopic temperatures extrapolated from these values are close to measured annual mean seawater temperatures. $\delta$18O values were relatively unaffected by shell specialisation. The only exception was Antarctic species Liothyrella uva, which did not have a complete tertiary shell layer typical of this genus and had $\delta$18O values of the innermost layer strongly correlated with $\delta$13C and mostly not in oxygen isotopic equilibrium with ambient seawater. With the exception of the rhynchonellid Notosaria nigricans, the outer primary layer material was depleted in $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O and highly variable. Inclusion of this material even as part of a whole shell sample could lead to misinterpretation of seawater temperature, therefore only fossil secondary layer material should be used. The anomalous articulated thecideidine brachiopod Thecidellina barretti is composed of mainly primary shell material and was not in oxygen isotope equilibrium. $\delta$18O values from the laminar secondary layer material of the inarticulated Craniida are highly variable. Therefore, these species are not recommended for use as palaeoenvironmental proxies. This study suggests caution when employing fossil brachiopod shells with similar ultrastructures to modern craniid and thecideidine brachiopods. The carbon isotope composition is highly variable in all of the brachiopods studied. Analysis of samples from specialised regions of the secondary shell layer show a pattern of depletion in 13C relative to non-specialised secondary material. The carbon isotope variability is independent of $\delta$18O and is repeated in most of the articulated species regardless of geographical location. This is possibly a vital effect produced by metabolic prioritisation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent estimates of the heat flux from the oceanic crust rest on the validity and accuracy of the half-space cooling (HSC) model. The known discrepancies between calculated and measured heat fluxes are not due to hydrothermal circulation, as commonly assumed, because the magmatic source provides too little energy, and the Rayleigh number is too small to foster vigorous convection on an oceanic scale. The half-space cooling model errs in assuming constant thermal conductivity (k), but more importantly, provides infinite flux along the ridge centers over all time for any form for k. This unrealistic global singularity strongly impacts the derived mean flux. We develop three independent methods to ascertain Earth's mean oceanic heat flux directly from compiled heat flow data. The results are congruent, insensitive to uncertainties in the dataset, corroborate previous spherical harmonic analyses, provide the same average flux as from the continents, and constrain the global power as 31??1 TW. Geological observations, inferred mantle overturn rates, estimated mantle cooling rates, and recent geodynamic models independently suggest that neither delayed secular cooling nor primordal heat are currently significant sources, necessitating that current heat production predominately originates in radioactive decay and is quasi-steady-state. Models of Earth's bulk composition based on CI chondritic meteorites provide an unrealistically low radioactive power of ???20 TW, whereas enstatite chondrites are sufficiently radioactive to supply the observed heat flux, contain enough iron metal to account for Earth's huge core, and have the same oxygen isotopic ratios as the bulk Earth. We devise a method to obtain K/U/Th ratios for the Earth and other planetary bodies from their power, including secular delays, and use this to constrain Earth's cooling rate. ?? Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To evaluate influence of chemical weathering of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) on seawater 87Sr/86Sr variation, river water and sediment samples were collected, and their Sr concentrations and isotopic compositions analyzed, from the seven large rivers that originated from the QTP. By combining these with the data of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus and Irrawaddy originated in the southern QTP, the total Sr flux of the eleven rivers reaches 3.47×109 mol{\textperiodcentered}a−1, which accounts for 10.2{\%} of the total Sr flux transported by the global rivers. The weighted mean 87Sr/86Sr is 0.71694, higher than the average value of the global rivers. The 87Srex (87Sr flux in excess of the seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratio) of the Chinese seven rivers is 1.55×106 mol{\textperiodcentered}a−1, only accounting for about 6{\%} of the value of the eleven rivers originated from QTP, and the Ganges-Brahmaputra system accounts for 86{\%}. We assume that the QTP rivers have no strontium contributions to the oceans before ∼40 Ma and the Sr fluxes of the global rivers, except the QTP eleven rivers, are constant, then a maximum linear increase in Sr fluxes of the QTP rivers from zero to the modern value in response to tectonic uplift can explain ∼69{\%} increase of seawater 87Sr/86Sr over the past ∼40 Ma and the remainder of 31{\%} is perhaps provided from other factors.

abstract = {Deep-sea benthic foraminifera live in the largest habitat on Earth, constitute an  important part of its benthic biomass, and form diverse assemblages with common cos-  mopolitan species. Modern deep-sea benthic foraminiferal assemblages are strongly  inﬂ uenced by events affecting their main food source, phytoplankton (a relationship  known as bentho-pelagic coupling). Surprisingly, benthic foraminifera did not suffer  signiﬁ cant extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, when phytoplankton communities  underwent severe extinction. Possibly, bentho-pelagic coupling was less strong than  today in the warm oceans of the Cretaceous–Paleogene, because of differences in the  process of food transfer from surface to bottom, or because more food was produced  chemosynthetically on the seaﬂ oor. Alternatively, after the end-Cretaceous extinction  the food supply from the photic zone recovered in less time than previously thought.  In contrast, deep-sea benthic foraminifera did undergo severe extinction (30{\%}–50{\%}  of species) at the end of the Paleocene, when planktic organisms show rapid evolu-  tionary turnover, but no major extinction. Causes of this benthic extinction are not  clear: net extinction rates were similar globally, but there is no independent evidence  for global anoxia or dysoxia, nor of globally consistent increase or decrease in productivity or carbonate dissolution. The extinction might be linked to a global feature  of the end-Paleocene environmental change, i.e., rapid global warming. Cenozoic  deep-sea benthic faunas show gradual faunal turnover during periods of pronounced  cooling and increase in polar ice volume: the late Eocene–early Oligocene, the middle  Miocene, and the middle Pleistocene. During the latter turnover, taxa that decreased  in abundance during the earlier two turnovers became extinct, possibly because of  increased oxygenation of the oceans, or because of increased seasonality in food delivery. The Eocene-Oligocene was the most extensive of these turnovers, and bentho-  pelagic coupling may have become established at that time.},

abstract = {In order to analyse how landmarks guide the last stages of an insect's approach to a goal, we recorded many ¯ights of individual wasps and honeybees as they ¯ew to an inconspicuous feeder on the ground that was marked by one or by two nearby landmarks. An indi- vidual tends to approach the feeder from a constant direction, ¯ying close to the ground. Its body is oriented in roughly the same horizontal direction during the ap- proach so that the feeder and landmarks are viewed over a narrow range of directions. Consequently, when the insect arrives at the feeder, the landmarks take up a standard position on the retina. Three navigational strategies govern the {\textregistered}nal approach. The insect {\textregistered}rst aims at a landmark, treating it as a beacon. Secondly, bees learn the appearance of a landmark with frontal retina and they associate with this stored view a motor tra- jectory which brings them from the landmark suciently close to the goal that it can be reached by image matching. Insects then move so as to put the landmark in its standard retinal position. Image matching is shown to be accomplished by a control system which has as set points the standard retinal position of the landmark and some parameter related to its retinal size.},

For geological specimens, the process of field evaporation and molecular ion formation and interpretation is not yet entirely understood. The objective of this study is to determine the best conditions for the preparation and analysis by APT of carbonate minerals, of great importance in the interpretation of geological processes, focusing on the bulk chemical composition. Results show that the complexity of the mass spectrum is different for calcite and dolomite and relates to dissimilarities in crystalochemical parameters. In addition, APT bulk chemistry of calcite closely matches the expected stoichiometry but fails to provide accurate atomic percentages for elements in dolomite under the experimental conditions evaluated in this work. For both calcite and dolomite, APT underestimates the amount of oxygen based on their chemical formula, whereas it is able to detect small percentages of elemental substitutions in crystal lattices. Overall, our results demonstrate that APT of carbonate minerals is possible, but further optimization of the experimental parameters are required to improve the use of atom probe tomography for the correct interpretation of mineral geochemistry.},

The calcium carbonate shells of planktic foraminifera provide our most valuable geochemical archive of ocean surface conditions and climate spanning the last 100 million years, and play an important role in the ocean carbon cycle. These shells are preserved in marine sediments as calcite, the stable polymorph of calcium carbonate. Here, we show that shells of living planktic foraminifers Orbulina universa and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei originally form from the unstable calcium carbonate polymorph vaterite, implying a non-classical crystallisation pathway involving metastable phases that transform ultimately to calcite. The current understanding of how planktic foraminifer shells record climate, and how they will fare in a future high-CO 2 world is underpinned by analogy to the precipitation and dissolution of inorganic calcite. Our findings require a re-evaluation of this paradigm to consider the formation and transformation of metastable phases, which could exert an influence on the geochemistry and solubility of the biomineral calcite.},

Current fisheries management approaches of the European Commission and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to implement an EAF are critically analysed. Shortcomings preventing a successful implementation of an EAF could be thereby identified on all levels, reaching from missing basic knowledge to an insufficient amount of data and questionable management concepts. Ideas how to overcome these shortcomings are discussed and some alternatives to currently planned measures to achieve a sustainable exploitation of fish stocks inside an EAF are suggested. It could be demonstrated that the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) concept in its current form is not suitable to reach the various objectives of an EAF.

abstract = {Magnesium is a key component used by many organisms in biomineralization. One role for magnesium is in stabilizing an otherwise unstable amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) phase. The way in which this stabilization is achieved is unknown. Here, we address this question by studying the chemical environment around magnesium in biogenic and synthetic ACCs using Mg K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). We show that although the short-range structure around the Mg ion is different in the various minerals studied, they all involve a shortening of the Mg-O bond length compared to crystalline anhydrous MgCO 3 minerals. We propose that the compact structure around magnesium introduces distortion in the CaCO 3 host mineral, thus inhibiting its crystallization. This study also shows that despite technical challenges in the soft X-ray energy regime, Mg K-edge XAS is a valuable tool for structural analysis of Mg containing amorphous materials, in biology and materials science.},

abstract = {The stability of magnesian calcites was reexamined, and new results are presented for 28 natural inorganic, 12 biogenic, and 32 synthetic magnesian calcites. The magnesian calcite solid-solutions were separated into two groups on the basis of differences in stoichiometric solubility and other physical and chemical properties. Group I consists of solids of mainly metamorphic and hydrothermal origin, synthetic calcites prepared at high temperatures and pressures, and synthetic solids prepared at low temperature and very low calcite supersaturations (??calcite ??? 1.5) from artificial sea water or NaClMgCl2CaCl2 solutions. Group I solids are essentially binary s of CaCO2 and MgCO2, and are thought to be relatively free of structural defects. Group II solid-solutions are of either biogenic origin or are synthetic magnesian calcites and protodolomites (0-20 and ??? 45 mole percent MgCO3) prepared at high calcite supersaturations (??calcite??? 3) from NaClNa2SO4MgCl2CaCl2 or NaClMgCl2CaCl2 solutions. Group II solid-solutions are treated as massively defective solids. The defects include substitution foreign ions (Na+ and SO42-) in the magnesian calcite lattice (point defects) and dislocations ({\~{}}2 ?? 109 cm-2). Within each group, the excess free energy of mixing, GE, is described by the mixing model ge = X(1- x)[A0 + A1(2x - 1)], where x is the mole fraction of the end-member Ca0.5Mg0.5CO3 in the solid-solution. The values of A0 and A1 for Group I and II solids were evaluated at 25??C. The equilibrium constants of all the solids are closely described by the equation ln Kx = x(1-x) RT[A0 + A1(2x- 1)]+ (1 - x) ln [KC(1- x)]+ x ln (KDx), where KC and KD are the equilibrium constants of calcite and Ca0.5Mg0.5CO3. Group I magnesian calcites were modeled as sub-regular solid-solutions between calcite and dolomite, and between calcite and "disordered dolomite". Both models yield almost identical equilibrium constants for these magnesian calcites. The Group II magnesian calcites were modeled as sub-regular solid-solutions between defective calcite and protodolomite. Group I and II solid-solutions differ significantly in stability. The rate of crystal growth and the chemical composition of the aqueous solutions from which the solids were formed are the main factors controlling stoichiometric solubility of the magnesian calcites and the density of crystal defects. The literature on the occurrence and behavior of magnesian calcites in sea water and other aqueous solutions is also examined. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {After 1987, Phytoplankton Colour (a visual estimate of chlorophyll) measured on samples taken by the continuous plankton recorder (CPR) in the North Sea increased substantially, both in level and seasonal extent, compared to earlier years since 1946. Many species of phytoplankton and zooplankton showed marked changes in abundance at about the same time. These events coincided with a large increase in catches of the western stock of the horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus L.) in the northern North Sea reflecting a northerly expansion of the stock along the shelf edge from the Bay of Biscay to the North Sea after 1987. Using a 3D hydrodynamic model, with input from measured wind parameters, monthly transport of oceanic water into the North Sea has been calculated for the period 1976-1994, integrated for a section from Orkney to Shetland to Norway. A substantial increase in oceanic inflow occurred in the winter months, December to March, from 1988. Higher sea surface temperatures were also measured after 1987 especially in spring and summer months. These biological and physical events may be a response to observed changes in pressure distribution over the North Atlantic. From 1988 onwards, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, the pressure difference between Iceland and the Azores, increased to the highest positive level observed in this century. Positive NAO anomalies are associated with stronger and more southerly tracks of the westerly winds and higher temperatures in western Europe. These changing wind distributions may have led to an increase in the northerly advection of water along the western edge of the European shelf and may have assisted the migration of the horse mackerel. This study is possibly a unique demonstration of a correlation between three different trophic levels of a marine ecosystem and hydrographic and atmospheric events at decadal and regional scales. The results emphasise the importance of maintaining into the future long term programmes such as the CPR. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {New Sr isotopic and concentration analyses of bulk carbonate and porewaters from a carbonate-rich Miocene section sampled at DSDP Site 575 are reported and used, along with our earlier data from a section of similar age at DSDP Site 590B, in a numerical model to determine for each site the rate of Sr exchange during diagenesis and the degree to which this amount of exchange has shifted the 87Sr86Sr of the bulk carbonate from the ratio each increment of sediment had when first deposited. Despite the fact that the two sites have very different water depth (4536 m at 575 vs. 1299 m at 590B), different sedimentation rate ( ∼ 10 m/My at 575 vs. ∼ 40 m/My at 590B), and significantly different porewater Sr2+ gradients, we find that the rate of Sr exchange as a function of sediment age is almost indistinguishable between the two sites. The rate of Sr exchange determined at the two sites is such that the resulting shift in bulk carbonate 87Sr86Sr due to diagenesis is small compared to the total range of 87Sr86Sr values measured, but large compared to the analytical uncertainty of the individual isotopic ratio measurements. By taking this shift into account we reconstruct the original 87Sr86Sr of each increment of carbonate sampled, which when plotted as a function of age becomes our best estimate of the Sr isotopic evolution of seawater. Because Sr is very well mixed in the ocean, at any given time there is a single worldwide value of seawater 87Sr86Sr. Therefore, if we are quantitatively accounting for the effect Sr exchange, we should find the same seawater evolution curve regardless of what DSDP Site is used. When we compare the observed bulk carbonate 87Sr86Sr vs. age at the two sites they are seen to differ by amounts that are sometimes large compared to the analytical uncertainties of the measurements. However, when these data are corrected for the post-depositional Sr isotopic shifts predicted by our diagenetic model, we find almost perfect agreement. This agreement suggests that we have made a realistic determination of the rate of Sr exchange and its consequences in terms of shifting the 87Sr86Sr of the bulk carbonate, and more importantly, that Sr isotopes can be used to correlate marine sediments with an accuracy comparable to the very small analytical uncertainties of modern isotopic measurements. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {Differences in the rate of coral reef carbonate deposition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene may account for the Quaternary variation of atmospheric CO2. Volumes of carbonate associated with Holocene reefs require an average deposition rate of 2.0 x 10(13) mol/yr for the past 5 ka. In light of combined riverine, midocean ridge, and ground-water fluxes of calcium to the oceans of 2.3 x 10(13) mol/yr, the current flux of calcium carbonate to pelagic sediments must be far below the Pleistocene average of 1.2 x 10(13) mol/yr. We suggest that sea-level change shifts the locus of carbonate deposition from the deep sea to the shelves as the normal glacial-interglacial pattern of deposition for Quaternary global carbonates. To assess the impact of these changes on atmospheric CO2, a simple numerical simulation of the global carbon cycle was developed. Atmospheric CO2 as well as calcite saturation depth and sediment responses to these carbonate deposition changes are examined. Atmospheric CO2 changes close to those observed in the Vostok ice core, approximately 80 ppm CO2, for the Quaternary are observed as well as the approximate depth changes in percent carbonate of sediments measured in the Pacific Ocean over the same time interval.},

abstract = {Culture experiments were carried out with the species Orbulina universa at four different pH values (7.7+/-0.05, 8.15+/-0.05, 8.60+/-0.05, and 9.0+/-0.10) in order to establish the pH-dependence of boron isotope fractionation between seawater and foraminifera. A clear relationship between the boron isotopic composition of the foraminifera and the pH of the seawater culture solutions was found, showing heavier boron isotopic composition at higher pH. This finding supports the viability of boron isotopes as a paleo-pH tool. It is important to note that Orbulina universa cultured in natural seawater, as well as those obtained from coretop samples, have a significantly lighter boron isotopic ratio than Globigerinoides sacculifer from coretop samples, suggesting that at least for this species, a vital effect is active.},

abstract = {The intra-species variability of magnesium in calcitic tests of the planktic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sinistral, its relationship to water temperature, salinity and diagenesis, and its potential for paleoceanographic interpretations are investigated, Core-top samples from high northern and southern latitudes and long sediment cores from the Norwegian Sea are investigated for their Recent foraminiferal magnesium content and the variability of magnesium during the past approximately 180,000 years. The quantitative measurement of magnesium was performed by electronmicroprobe analysis. Sample contamination as well as the influence of early diagenetic processes, potentially altering the original element content, can be ruled out for the samples and the time period considered here. Magnesium concentrations in N. pachyderma sinistral are generally lower than published concentrations within other species, Moreover, the foraminiferal tests appear to be undersaturated with respect to magnesium for the water temperatures they have experienced. Magnesium concentrations in Recent N. pachyderma sinistral covary most closely with surface water temperature, Salinity changes are of minor importance, Down-core magnesium variations covering the last climatic changes correlate to sedimentological and geochemical parameters, In general, relatively high magnesium concentrations appear during interglacials, whereas low magnesium concentrations occur during glacial periods, Even short climatic events, such as the Younger Dryas cooling, are reflected in the magnesium signal. It is therefore suggested that magnesium in foraminiferal tests reflects relative water temperature variations even at high latitudes, and thus may serve as a paleoceanographic tool to reconstruct changes in surface water circulation.},

abstract = {The influence of pH and concentration on boron coprecipitation by calcite were evaluated under near-equilibrium conditions at 25°C. Calcite was precipitated by adding a metastable polymorph (vaterite or aragonite) to a solution of known boron concentration. This method maintains a nearly constant solution composition during the slow conversion of the metastable polymorph to calcite. Boron uptake in calcite was found to be strongly pH-dependent, increasing two orders of magnitude from pH 8.5 to pH 10.5. Boron incorporation into calcites precipitated from vaterite-saturated solutions was five times greater than in calcites precipitated from aragonite-saturated solutions. Ostensibly, these results suggest that the calcite precipitation rates were not low enough to attain equilibrium partitioning of boron into calcite. However, scanning electron micrograph analyses showed that the prevalent crystal forms of calcite generated from aragonite and those generated from vaterite were distinctly different. The different quantities of boron incorporated into these calcites may reflect different crystal growth mechanisms, consistent with face-dependent nonequilibrium partitioning of trace elements in calcite. At a constant pH of 9.0, boron uptake increased from less than 15 to over 290 mg/kg CaCO3 as the solution boron concentration was increased from 5 to 100 mg/kg. Our results agree with those of other investigators, despite differences in solution composition, and calcite precipitation techniques used. The agreement between the studies may be because the crystal growth morphology of the calcite was rhombohedral in both cases.},

abstract = {We address the organization of workers in social insect societies. We distinguish between changes in behavioural role over the nurse to forager role sequence, which may depend on changes in physiology, and potentially more rapid changes of task within role. We investigated the association between role and nutrient status in the ant Leptothorax albipennis. Worker lipid stores were quantified using a new body size-controlled method, and were related to worker behaviour. Worker lipid stores were evenly distributed amongst colony members at the end of winter, splitting rapidly into two distinct modes (replete nurses and lean foragers) in spring. The proportion of lean foragers increased throughout spring and summer, until most colonies contained only workers of this type. Callow workers then eclosed with intermediate lipid stores. We developed a computer vision system that tracks all nest ants to extract detailed behaviour of individuals of known lipid stores. Lipid storage was negatively correlated with a worker's foraging propensity, and with measures of spatial occupation in the nest and of activity. Different colonies showed a similar quantitative correlation between lipid stores and behavioural role, suggesting that lipid stores were not only correlated with the relative organization of individuals within each nest, but may also have influenced their absolute role. We reviewed the literature and found evidence that nutrient status influences role predisposition in social insect workers. We conclude that the distribution of worker roles may be linked to the balance between foraging income and energetic consumption within the colony directly via worker nutrient status.

@article{Feely2009,
abstract = {With increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, the extent of effects on the ocean and marine resources is an increasing concern. One aspect of this issue is the ongoing process (known as ocean acidification) whereby seawater becomes less alkaline as more CO2 dissolves in it, causing hydrogen ion concentration in seawater to increase. Scientists are concerned that increasing hydrogen ion concentration could reduce growth or even cause death of shell-forming animals (e.g., corals, mollusks, and certain planktonic organisms) as well as disrupt marine food webs and the reproductive physiology of certain species. While not yet fully understood, the ecological and economic consequences of ocean acidification could be substantial. Scientists are concerned that increasing hydrogen ion concentration in seawater could alter biogeochemical cycles, disrupt physiological processes of marine organisms, and damage marine ecosystems. This report does not discuss the effects of increasing thermal stress to marine organisms and ecosystems (e.g., coral bleaching) related to climate change. However, marine ecosystems are likely to be affected by the synergistic effects of factors involved in both thermal and chemical processes. Congress is beginning to focus attention on better understanding ocean acidification and determining how this concern might be addressed. In the 111th Congress, the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act of 2009 (Title XII, Subtitle D, of P.L. 111-11) directed the Secretary of Commerce to establish an ocean acidification program within NOAA, established an interagency committee to develop an ocean acidification research and monitoring plan, and authorized appropriations through FY2012 for NOAA and the National Science Foundation.

Recent discoveries of amorphous precursors and evidence for cluster aggregation and liquid-liquid separation contradict common assumptions of classical nucleation theory. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to explore calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nucleation in a cell that enables reagent mixing, we demonstrate that multiple nucleation pathways are simultaneously operative, including formation both directly from solution and indirectly through transformation of amorphous and crystalline precursors. However, an amorphous-to-calcite transformation is not observed. The behavior of amorphous calcium carbonate upon dissolution suggests that it encompasses a spectrum of structures, including liquids and solids. These observations of competing direct and indirect pathways are consistent with classical predictions, whereas the behavior of amorphous particles hints at an underlying commonality among recently proposed precursor-based mechanisms.},

abstract = {Coral reefs, with their millions of species, have changed profoundly because of the effects of people, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Reefs are subject to many of the same processes that affect other human-dominated ecosystems, but some special features merit emphasis: (i) Many dominant reef builders spawn eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs. They are thus particularly vulnerable to Allee effects, including potential extinction associated with chronic reproductive failure. (ii) The corals likely to be most resistant to the effects of habitat degradation are small, short-lived “weedy” corals that have limited dispersal capabilities at the larval stage. Habitat degradation, together with habitat fragmentation, will therefore lead to the establishment of genetically isolated clusters of inbreeding corals. (iii) Increases in average sea temperatures by as little as 1°C, a likely result of global climate change, can cause coral “bleaching” (the breakdown of coral–algal symbiosis), changes in symbiont communities, and coral death. (iv) The activities of people near reefs increase both fishing pressure and nutrient inputs. In general, these processes favor more rapidly growing competitors, often fleshy seaweeds, and may also result in explosions of predator populations. (v) Combinations of stress appear to be associated with threshold responses and ecological surprises, including devastating pathogen outbreaks. (vi) The fossil record suggests that corals as a group are more likely to suffer extinctions than some of the groups that associate with them, whose habitat requirements may be less stringent.},

abstract = {Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is a metastable phase that forms in diverse biogeochemical settings. This material can incorporate significant amounts of magnesium and other elements, but the conditions that regulate composition are not established. Using a mixed flow reactor method, we synthesize Mg-free ACC (control) and amorphous magnesium calcium carbonate (ACMC) under controlled chemical conditions to determine the relationship between composition and inorganic solution chemistry. Input solutions contained a constant initial Mg/Ca ratio of 5/1 with variable total carbonate concentration, pH, and supersaturation. Within the reactor, input solution chemistry evolves in proportion to the extent of precipitation whereby the initial Mg/Ca ratio increases to values as high as 14 at steady state conditions. By this approach, we produce reproducible quantities of ACMC with 24 to {\textgreater}70mol{\%}Mg to give compositions of Mg(0.24-0.72)Ca(0.76-0.28)CO3??1.42-1.63H2O.The primary control on ACMC composition is the steady state solution composition that develops in the reactor during precipitation. Analysis of the data shows the Mg content of ACMC is regulated by the interplay of three factors at steady state conditions: (1) Mg/Ca ratio; (2) total carbonate concentration; and (3) solution pH. Using the Henderson-Kracek model to estimate the partition coefficients for the Mg content of ACMC, we find KD is approximately constant at 0.047. ?? 0.003 when steady state pH is less than 9.5, but values of KD triple as steady state pH increases from 9.5 to 10.3. Our KD values are lower than previous estimates that are based upon initial solution composition. In contrast, our estimates of KD are determined from the solution chemistry at steady state conditions and for pH conditions that are less extreme than previous experimental studies. We suggest the approach of using steady state composition to estimate KD gives a more accurate representation of relationships between ACMC composition and local conditions. The findings demonstrate local pH and total carbonate concentration can be regulated at the time of formation to produce Mg amorphous carbonates of a designated composition.},

abstract = {An in-situ water circulator (ISWAC) was developed to allow accurate measurement of dissolution rates of various carbonate particles with minimal stagnation and mechanical weight loss. Three ISWAC packages were deployed at 3600, 4800 and 5518 m for 79 days in the Sargasso Sea (Northwest Atlantic). Weight losses for different particles during 79 days at 5518 m were as follows: pteropods and synthetic aragonite, 72.8{\%}; reagent calcite, 57.5{\%}; foraminifera, 23–36{\%}; coccoliths, 11.3–24{\%}, and diatoms, 12{\%}. These weight losses are 2.5–7.5 times higher than those reported in earlier in-situ experiments. Normalization of weight losses with respect to BET specific surface area for different calcite particles yielded specific dissolution rates that differed by more than 2 orders of magnitude. Bleached biogenic particles dissolve significantly faster than non-bleached although their surface area is identical. We suggest that the BET surface area does not represent the reactive surface area available for dissolution, especially in biogenic calcite particles. Coatings, probably of organic matter, may reduce the reactive surface area and thus retard dissolution rates. The existence of a chemical lysocline in the Northwest Atlantic was confirmed. However, it seems that different kinds of particles have different lysoclines. The origin of the lysocline cannot be attributed to water flow or to the thermodynamic transition from supersaturation to undersaturation ($\Omega$ = 1). It seems to be a kinetic phenomenon. A simple model comparing the complete dissolution time and the residence time of a particle on the sediment-water interface suggests that coccoliths can be preserved in the sediments of the deep Northwest Atlantic below the CCD, in good agreement with SEM observations.},

Evolved oxygen from isolated spinach thylakoids was isotopically identical (within analytical error) to its source water. Similar results were obtained with Anacystis nidulans Richter and Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin cultures purged with helium. For consumptive reactions, discrimination ([delta], where 1 + [delta]/1000 equals the isotope effect, k16/k18 or k12/k13) was determined by analysis of residual substrate (O2 or CO2). The [delta] for the Mehler reaction, mediated by ferredoxin or methylviologen, was 15.3[per mille (thousand) sign]. Oxygen isotope discrimination during oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) catalyzed by RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) was 21.3[per mille (thousand) sign] and independent of enzyme source, unlike carbon isotope discrimination: 30.3[per mille (thousand) sign] for spinach enzyme and 19.6 to 23[per mille (thousand) sign] for Rhodospirillum rubrum and A. nidulans enzymes, depending on reaction conditions. The [delta] for O2 consumption catalyzed by glycolate oxidase was 22.7[per mille (thousand) sign]. The expected overall [delta] for photorespiration is about 21.7[per mille (thousand) sign]. Consistent with this, when Asparagus sprengeri Regel mesophyll cells approached the compensation point within a sealed vessel, the [delta]18O of dissolved O2 came to a steady-state value of about 21.5[per mille (thousand) sign] relative to the source water. The results provide improved estimates of discrimination factors in several reactions prominent in the global O cycle and indicate that photorespiration plays a significant part in determining the isotopic composition of atmospheric oxygen.},

Analyses of this kind can provide insights into the origins of noise, the shape of mass peaks, or unexpected anomalies within the spectrum. Data can often be recovered from within the spectrum noise by considering the time-of-flight differences between ions within a multiple event. Correlated ion detection, particularly when associated with shifts in ion energies, may be used to probe the phenomenon of molecular ion dissociation, including the questions of data loss due to ion pile-up or the generation of neutrals in the dissociation process. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: An animal's behavioral strategies are often constrained by its evolutionary history and the resources available to it. Artificial evolution allows one to manipulate such constraints and explore how they influence evolved strategies. Here we compare the navigational strategies of flying insects with those of artificially evolved "animals" endowed with various motor architectures. Using evolutionary algorithms, we generated artificial neural networks that controlled a virtual animal's navigation within a 2D, simulated world. Like a flying insect, the animal possessed motors that generated thrust and torque, a compass, and visual sensors. Some animals were limited to forward motion, while others could also move sideways. Animals were selected for the precision with which they reached a target specified by a visual landmark. Results: Animats given sideways motors could alter flight direction without changing body orientation and evolved strategies similar to those of flying bees or wasps performing the same task. Both animats and insects first aimed at the landmark. In the last phase, both adopted a fixed body orientation and adjusted their position to keep the landmark at a fixed retinal location. Animals unable to uncouple flight direction and body orientation evolved subtly different strategies and performed less robustly. Conclusions: This convergence between the navigational strategies of animals and animals suggests that the insect's strategies are primarily an adaptation to the demands of using visual information and compass direction to reach a position in space and that they are not significantly compromised by the insect's evolutionary history.},

abstract = {Ontogenetic (developmental stage) measurements of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca were made on the benthic foraminifer Bulimina aculeata, which were cultured under controlled physicochemical conditions of temperature, pH, alkalinity, salinity, and trace- and minor-element concentrations. We utilized two methods of ontogenetic sampling-whole specimens progressively increasing in length and laser microdissection of a single specimen with subsequent analysis of dissected portions. A novel high-resolution laser-microdissection (HRLM) method allowed for precise (10 $\mu$m) cuts of the foraminiferal tests (shells) along the geometrically complex sutures distinguishing individual chambers. This new microdissection method limited sample loss and cross-contamination between foraminiferal chambers. Little or no variation in DSr was observed at different foraminiferal developmental stages. Conversely, DMg was enriched during a mid-developmental stage of whole-specimen samples (150-225 $\mu$m DMg = 1.6 × 10-3) compared to earlier and later stages ({\textless}150 $\mu$m, {\textgreater}225 $\mu$m DMg = 8.3 × 10-4). Further analysis of HRLM ontogenetic samples showed a larger, age-dependent DMg signature variation. This increase in shell Mg/Ca may contribute substantially to the measured inter-individual variability in Mg/Ca temperature prediction for cultured B. aculeata. Due to relatively large Mg/Ca inter- and intra-individual variability, measuring similar-size foraminiferal samples may improve the precision of paleotemperature prediction. Additionally, partial dissolution of the highest ontogenetically Mg-enriched calcite (DMg = 1.3 × 10-2-1.6 × 10-2) may occur in undersaturated bottom-water environments or during reductive cleaning procedures. Thus, the calcite phases remaining after partial dissolution by either natural or laboratory cleaning processes may not accurately represent the calcification environment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Coccolithophores impact the ocean carbon cycle principally through the generation of CO2 during CaCO3 production. Coccolithophore biomineralization has been examined most extensively in Pleurochrysis carterae and Emiliania huxleyi both of which produce mineralized scales - coccoliths - composed of elaborate calcite crystals attached to an underlying organic base plate. Calcification of preformed base plates is mediated by acidic polysaccharides and occurs in Golgi-derived structures known as mineralizing vesicles. In Pleurochrysis a high capacity calcium-binding polysaccharide PS2 is required for efficient nucleation of calcitic protocrystals. A galacturonomannan PS3 is required for the growth and transformation of the protocrystals into a massive double disc of calcite. The genes that regulate expression of the glycans have not yet been identified. In addition to the coccolith-bearing diploid phases, Pleurochrysis and Emiliania possess both haploid and diploid non-calcifying stages, which are self-perpetuating via binary fission. One non-calcifying Pleurochrysis phase fails to synthesis PS2 and spontaneously reverts to the mineralizing morphotype in laboratory cultures. As yet, there is little information on environmental factors that effect the expression or silencing of calcifying genes or favor the growth of calcifying over non-calcifying phases. These issues will need extensive investigation, if we are to appreciate the role of coccolithophores in the regulation of atmospheric CO2 levels. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Many organisms use amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) during crystalline calcium carbonate biomineralization, as a means to control particle shape/size and phase stability. Here, we present an in situ small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) study of the mechanisms and kinetics of ACC crystallization at rapid time scales (seconds). Combined with offline solid and solution characterization, we show that ACC crystallizes to vaterite via a three-stage process. First, hydrated and disordered ACC forms, then rapidly transforms to more ordered and dehydrated ACC; in conjunction with this, vaterite forms via a spherulitic growth mechanism. Second, when the supersaturation of the solution with respect to vaterite decreases sufficiently, the mechanism changes to ACC dissolution and vaterite crystal growth. The third stage is controlled by Ostwald ripening of the vaterite particles. Combining this information with previous studies, allowed us to develop a mechanistic understanding of the abiotic crystallization process from ACC to vaterite and all the way to calcite. We propose this is the underlying abiotic mechanism for calcium carbonate biomineralization from ACC. This process is then augmented or altered by organisms (e.g., using organic compounds) to form intricate biominerals. This study also highlights the applicability of in situ time-resolved SAXS/WAXS to study rapid crystallization reactions. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

Analysis of the effects on crystallization kinetics has abundantly shown the regulation of crystal growth by organic molecules. However, the range of biomineralized structures in nature indicates that their role in nucleation is also crucial. Biominerals often grow in exact locations (cell compartments) within complex crystal composites and exhibit speciﬁc crystallographic orientations. Such features can only be determined during the nucleation stage. Indeed, a substantial body of circumstantial evidence suggests that proteins and other organic molecules in a wide range of biomineral structures serve as nucleation “templates”, providing preferential sites for nucleation and controlling the orientation of the resulting crystals.},

abstract = {Between 1991 and 1999, carbon measurements were made on twenty-five WOCE/JGOFS/OACES cruises in the Pacific Ocean. Investigators from 15 different laboratories and four countries analyzed at least two of the four measurable ocean carbon parameters (DIC, TAlk,fCO2, and pH) on almost all cruises. The goal of this work is to assess the quality of the Pacific carbon survey data and to make recommendations for generating a unified data set that is consistent between cruises. Several different lines of evidence were used to examine the consistency, including comparison of calibration techniques, results from certified reference material analyses, precision of at-sea replicate analyses, agreement between shipboard analyses and replicate shore based analyses, comparison of deep water values at locations where two or more cruises overlapped or crossed, consistency with other hydrographic parameters, and internal consistency with multiple carbon parameter measurements. With the adjustments proposed here, the data can be combined to generate a Pacific Ocean data set, with over 36,000 unique sample locations analyzed for at least two carbon parameters in most cases. The best data coverage was for DIC, which has an estimated overall accuracy of ∼ 3 $\mu$ mol kg-1. TAlk, the second most common carbon parameter analyzed, had an estimated overall accuracy of ∼ 5 $\mu$ mol kg-1.

By the end of the experiment, the phytoplankton community in all samples was dominated by diatoms and Phaeocystis sp. However, the relative abundance of these phytoplankton taxa differed significantly between CO2 treatments. Taxonomic pigment analysis and direct microscopic examination of samples revealed that the abundance of diatoms decreased by similar to50{\%} at low CO2 relative to high CO2, while the abundance of Phaeocystis increased by similar to60{\%} at low CO2. This CO2-dependent shift was associated with a significant change in nutrient utilization, with higher ratios of nitrate: silicate (N:Si) and nitrate:phosphate (N:P) consumption by phytoplankton in the low CO2 treatment. Despite the significant changes in taxonomic composition and nutrient consumption ratios, total biomass and primary productivity did not differ significantly between the CO2 treatments. Our results suggest that CO2 concentrations could potentially influence competition among marine phytoplankton taxa and affect oceanic nutrient cycling.},

Not only are VSMs exceptionally preserved in Chuar rocks, they exhibit a much higher degree of morphological diversity than was previously known. Using the taxonomy of modern testate amoebae as a guide, nine new species and eight new genera of VSMs are described, augmenting the eight species and two genera already recognized. Taxa described here are Melanocyrillium hexodiadema Bloeser, 1985, Trigonocyrillium horodyskii (Bloeser, 1985) n. comb., T. fimbriatum (Bloeser, 1985) n. comb., Cycliocyrillium simplex n. sp., C. torquata n. sp., Bonniea dacruchares n. sp., B. pytinaia n. sp., Trachycyrillium pudens n. sp., Palaeoarcela athanata n. sp., Hemisphaerilla ornata n. sp., Bombycion micron n. sp., and Melicerion poikilon n. sp. All of the test characters observed in VSM taxa (e.g., collars; indentations; hexagonal symmetry; lobed, triangular or invaginated apertures; curved necks) occur in modern testate amoeban taxa, though not always in the same combinations. Some VSM species have characters found today in diverse extant taxa, making it difficult to assess their relationships. A few species, however, have character combinations that closely approximate those found in specific genera of both lobose and filose testate amoebae, suggesting that at least stem group, and possibly crown group, representatives of these taxa were present approximately 742 Ma. These fossils indicate that ecosystems were diverse and complex, that eukaryotic biomineralization had already evolved, and that the last common ancestor of animals+fungi had already appeared by approximately 750 Ma. },

Our results suggest that glacial SST was about 4??C cooler in the Subantarctic Indian Ocean and 2.5??C cooler in the Subantarctic Pacific. Comparison of SST and planktonic ??18O records indicates that changes in SST lead changes in ??18O by on average 1-3 kyr. The glacial-interglacial temperature change indicated by the Subantarctic Mg/Ca records suggests that temperature accounts for 40-60{\%} of the foraminiferal ??18O change. We have used the Mg/Ca-based SST estimates and ??18O determinations to generate site-specific seawater ??18O records, which suggest that seawater ??18O was on average 10??? more positive during glacial episodes compared with interglacial episodes.},

abstract = {MEASUREMENTS of the cadmium content of marine CaCO3 deposits, such as aragonitic corals1 and foraminiferal shells2,3, have been used to trace past ocean circulation2 and as an indicator of labile nutrient concentrations4. In particular, studies of foraminiferal cadmium have provided insight into the oceanic processes controlling atmospheric CO2 concentration in glacial times5,6. The use of Cd/Ca ratios in CaCO3 as a labile nutrient indicator is made possible by a relationship between seawater cadmium and phosphate content that is remarkably uniform throughout the present ocean (Fig.l). In deep waters of the open ocean, [Cd] at a given value of [PO3- 4] is consistent within about 7{\%}; However, there is a unusual kink in the relationship at [PO3- 4] 1.3 mol kg-1 whose cause is not known but which has been suggested2 to result from a slightly deeper regeneration cycle for Cd relative to PO3- 4. Points to the right of the kink correspond mainly to intermediate and deep waters of the North Pacific, whereas low PO3- 4 concentrations to the left of the kink represent mainly Atlantic and upper-ocean waters4. Waters of the Southern Ocean have a strong influence on the composition of the global ocean but few Cd−PO3- 4 measurements are available for this region.

abstract = {Anthropogenic global warming affects marine ecosystems in complex ways, and declining ocean oxygenation is a growing concern. Forecasting the geographical and bathymetric extent, rate, and intensity of future deoxygenation and its effects on oceanic biota, however, remains highly challenging because of the complex feedbacks in the Earth-ocean biota system. Information on past global warming events such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, {\~{}}55.5 Ma), a potential analog for present and future global warming, may help in such forecasting. Documenting past ocean deoxygenation, however, is hampered by the lack of sensitive proxies for past oceanic oxygen levels throughout the water column. As yet no evidence has been presented for pervasive deoxygenation in the upper water column through expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). We apply a novel proxy for paleoredox conditions, the iodine to calcium ratio (I/Ca) in bulk coarse fraction sediment and planktonic foraminiferal tests from pelagic sites in different oceans, and compared our reconstruction with modeled oxygen levels. The reconstructed iodate gradients indicate that deoxygenation occurred in the upper water column in the Atlantic, Indian Oceans, and possibly the Pacific Ocean, as well during the PETM, due to vertical and potentially lateral expansion of OMZs.},

abstract = {1. Climate change impacts have been observed on individual species and species subsets; however, it remains to be seen whether there are systematic, coherent assemblage-wide responses to climate change that could be used as a representative indicator of changing biological state. 2. European shelf seas are warming faster than the adjacent land masses and faster than the global average. We explore the year-by-year distributional response of North Sea bottom-dwelling (demersal) fishes to temperature change over the 25 years from 1980 to 2004. The centres of latitudinal and depth distributions of 28 fishes were estimated from species-abundance–location data collected on an annual fish monitoring survey. 3. Individual species responses were aggregated into 19 assemblages reflecting physiology (thermal preference and range), ecology (body size and abundance-occupancy patterns), biogeography (northern, southern and presence of range boundaries), and susceptibility to human impact (fishery target, bycatch and non-target species). 4. North Sea winter bottom temperature has increased by 1{\textperiodcentered}6 ° C over 25 years, with a 1 ° C increase in 1988–1989 alone. During this period, the whole demersal fish assemblage deepened by {\~{}}3{\textperiodcentered}6 m decade –1 and the deepening was coherent for most assemblages. 5. The latitudinal response to warming was heterogeneous, and reflects (i) a northward shift in the mean latitude of abundant, widespread thermal specialists, and (ii) the southward shift of relatively small, abundant southerly species with limited occupancy and a northern range boundary in the North Sea. 6. Synthesis and applications. The deepening of North Sea bottom-dwelling fishes in response to climate change is the marine analogue of the upward movement of terrestrial species to higher altitudes. The assemblage-level depth responses, and both latitudinal responses, covary with temperature and environmental variability in a manner diagnostic of a climate change impact. The deepening of the demersal fish assemblage in response to temperature could be used as a biotic indicator of the effects of climate change in the North Sea and other semi-enclosed seas.},

abstract = {Functioning of the Black Sea ecosystem has profoundly changed since the early 1970s under cumulative effects of excessive nutrient enrichment, strong cooling/warming, over-exploitation of pelagic fish stocks, and population outbreak of gelatinous carnivores. Applying a set of criteria to the long-term (1960-2000) ecological time-series data, the present study demonstrates that the Black Sea ecosystem was reorganised during this transition phase in different forms of top-down controlled food web structure through successive regime-shifts of distinct ecological properties. The Secchi disc depth, oxic-anoxic interface zone, dissolved oxygen and hydrogen sulphide concentrations also exhibit abrupt transition between their alternate regimes, and indicate tight coupling between the lower trophic food web structure and the biogeochemical pump in terms of regime-shift events. The first shift, in 1973-1974, marks a switch from large predatory fish to small planktivore fish-controlled system, which persisted until 1989 in the form of increasing small pelagic and phytoplankton biomass and decreasing zooplankton biomass. The increase in phytoplankton biomass is further supported by a bottom-up contribution due to the cumulative response to high anthropogenic nutrient load and the concurrent shift of the physical system to the "cold climate regime" following its ???20-year persistence in the "warm climate regime". The end of the 1980s signifies the depletion of small planktivores and the transition to a gelatinous carnivore-controlled system. By the end of the 1990s, small planktivore populations take over control of the system again. Concomitantly, their top-down pressure when combined with diminishing anthropogenic nutrient load and more limited nutrient supply into the surface waters due to stabilizing effects of relatively warm winter conditions switched the "high production" regime of phytoplankton to its background "low production" regime. The Black Sea regime-shifts appear to be sporadic events forced by strong transient decadal perturbations, and therefore differ from the multi-decadal scale cyclical events observed in pelagic ocean ecosystems under low-frequency climatic forcing. The Black Sea observations illustrate that eutrophication and extreme fishery exploitation can indeed induce hysteresis in large marine ecosystems, when they can exert sufficiently strong forcing onto the system. They further illustrate the link between the disruption of the top predators, proliferation of new predator stocks, and regime-shift events. Examples of these features have been reported for some aquatic ecosystems, but are extremely limited for large marine ecosystems. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {Nucleation in the natural world often occurs in the presence of organic interfaces. In mineralized tissues, a range of macromolecular matrices are found in contact with inorganic phases and are believed to direct mineral formation. In geochemical settings, mineral surfaces, which are often covered with organic or biological films, surround the volume within which nucleation occurs. In the classical picture of nucleation, the presence of such interfaces is expected to have a profound effect on nucleation rates, simply because they can reduce the interfacial free energy, which controls the height of the thermodynamic barrier to nucleation of the solid phase. However, the recent discovery of a nearly monodisperse population of calcium carbonate clusters-so called pre-nucleation clusters-and the many observations of amorphous precursor phases have called into question the applicability of classical descriptions. Here we use in situ observations of nucleation on organothiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to explore the energetics and pathways of calcite nucleation at organic interfaces. We find that carboxyl SAM-directed nucleation is described well in purely classical terms through a reduction in the thermodynamic barrier due to decreased interfacial free energy. Moreover, the differences in nucleation kinetics on odd and even chain-length carboxyl SAMs are attributable to relative differences in these energies. These differences arise from varying degrees of SAM order related to oxygen-oxygen interactions between SAM headgroups. In addition, amorphous particles formed prior to or during crystal nucleation do not grow and are not observed to act as precursors to the crystalline phase. Instead, calcite appears to nucleate independently. These results imply that the recently proposed model of calcite formation as a non-classical process, one which proceeds via aggregation of stable pre-nucleation clusters that form an amorphous precursor from which the crystalline phase emerges, is not applicable to template-directed nucleation on carboxyl SAMs and does not provide a universal description of calcite formation.},

abstract = {Early Triassic animal body fossils and trace fossils are small relative to those in older and younger intervals. Size decreases sharply through the end-Permian extinction event and Permian/Triassic boundary, and the smallest sizes are encountered in the parvus and isarcica Zones of the earliest Induan. Animals appearing within these two zones are also exceedingly small, compared to younger congenerics and conspecifics. Temporary, dramatic size decrease of surviving taxa in the immediate aftermath of the extinction event is an example of the Lilliput effect (coined by [Urbanek, A., 1993. Biotic crises in the history of Upper Silurian graptoloids: a palaeobiological model. Historical Biology 7, 29-50.]). Body size increases somewhat from the carinata Zone (mid-Induan) but remains depressed for the duration of the Early Triassic, and pre-extinction sizes are not commonly recorded until at least the Middle Triassic. Marine and terrestrial faunas appear to be similarly affected. The Lilliput effect and longer term size reduction could be the result of several factors. Environmental parameters such as marine anoxia, due to low atmospheric concentrations of oxygen at this time coupled with sluggish ocean circulation in a greenhouse world, and food shortage are the likely proximal causes for the Early Triassic Lilliput effect. No single cause can explain all the observations, and a combination of factors are likely to be involved. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. Attempts to restore damaged ecosystems usually emphasize structural aspects of biodiversity, such as species richness and abundance. An alternative is to emphasize functional aspects, such as patterns of interaction between species. Pollination is a ubiquitous interaction between plants and animals. Patterns in plantpollinator interactions can be analysed with a food web or complexsystems approach and comparing pollination webs between restored and reference sites can be used to test whether ecological restoration has taken place. 2. Using an ecological network approach, we compared plantpollinator interactions on four pairs of restored and ancient heathlands 11 and 14 years following initiation of restoration management. We used the network data to test whether visitation by pollinators had been restored and we calculated pollinator importance indices for each insect species on the eight sites. Finally, we compared the robustness of the restored and ancient networks to species loss. 3. Plant and pollinator communities were established successfully on the restored sites. There was little evidence of movement of pollinators from ancient sites onto adjacent restored sites, although paired sites correlated in pollinator species richness in both years. There was little insect species overlap within each heathland between 2001 and 2004. 4. A few widespread insect species dominated the communities and were the main pollinators. The most important pollinators were typically honeybees ( Apis mellifera ), species of bumblebee ( Bombus spp.) and one hoverfly species ( Episyrphus balteatus ). The interaction networks were significantly less complex on restored heathlands, in terms of connectance values, although in 2004 the low values might reflect the negative relationship between connectance and species richness. Finally, there was a trend of restored networks being more susceptible to perturbation than ancient networks, although this needs to be interpreted with caution. 5. Synthesis and applications. Ecological networks provide a powerful tool for assessing the outcome of restoration programmes. Our results indicate that heathland restoration does not have to occur immediately adjacent to ancient heathland for functional pollinator communities to be established. Moreover, in terms of restoring pollinator interactions, heathland managers need only be concerned with the most common insect species. Our focus on pollination demonstrates how a key ecological service can serve as a yardstick for judging restoration success.},

abstract = {The eggshell matrix is mainly composed of proteins that are thought to influence shell formation and calcification and, thus, modify the resulting properties of the shell. We investigated the potential of some of these proteins as biomarkers of eggshell quality by developing a competitive indirect ELISA for quantifying ovotransferrin, ovalbumin, and ovocleidin-17 in eggshell extract. Eggshell fragments were demineralized in acetic acid (20{\%}) and freeze-dried. The micro-extraction yield was markedly increased ({\textgreater}50{\%}) when Tween 20 was added to the subsequent extraction and dialysis milieus. Microplates were coated with ovotransferrin and ovalbumin in a 0.1M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, but ovocleidin-17 was fixed with acetone (-20 C, 20 min). Optimal dilutions of the monoclonal (ovotransferrin) and polyclonal (ovalbumin and ovocleidin-17) antibodies were 1/3,000, 1/25,000 and 1/4,000, respectively. The inhibition curves were optimized by preincubating the antibodies and proteins overnight. The intraassay coefficient ({\textless}5{\%}), parallelism of the standards and samples curves, and recovery (101{\%}) were satisfactory for ovotransferrin. Measurements of ovalbumin were less precise because of higher interassay variation and differences between the slopes of standard and sample inhibition curves. Ovocleidin-17 assays showed similar slopes for standard and eggshell extracts. Although the total protein in soluble matrix extracts was not affected by age, the concentrations of these proteins were higher in eggshell extracts from older hens compared with those from young hens: 1.98x for ovotransferrin, 1.86x for ovalbumin, and 1.58x for ovocleidin-17. The quantification of specific eggshell matrix proteins in shell of differing quality is, therefore, a promising tool for analyzing the origin of eggshell faults and may provide useful information for breeding programs.},

abstract = {The seeded precipitation (crystal growth) of aragonite and calcite from sea water, magnesium-depleted sea water, and magnesium-free sea water has been studied by means of the steady-state disequilibrium initial rate method. Dissolved magnesium at sea water levels appears to have no effect on the rate of crystal growth of aragonite, but a strong retarding effect on that of calcite. By contrast, at levels less than about 5 per cent of the sea water level, Mg has little or no effect on calcite growth. Extended crystal growth on pure calcite seeds in sea water of normal Mg content resulted in the crystallization of magnesium calcite overgrowths, containing 7-10 mole {\%} MgCO3 in solid solution. This suggests that the rate inhibition by Mg is due to its incorporation within the calcite crystal structure during growth, which causes the resulting magnesian calcite to be considerably more soluble than pure calcite. The standard free energy of formation of 8.5 mole{\%} Mg calcite calculated on this assumption is in good agreement with independent estimates of magnesian calcite stability. From the work of Katz (Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 37, 1563-1586, 1973), Plummer and Mackenzie (Amer. J. Sci. 273, 515-522, 1974), and the present paper, it can be predicted that the most stable calcite in Ca-Mg exchange equilibrium with sea water contains between 2 and 7 mole{\%}MgCO3 in solid solution. Likewise, calcites containing more than 8.5 mole{\%} MgCO3 are less stable, and those containing less than 8.5 mole{\%} MgCO3 are more stable than aragonite plus Ca and Mg in sea water. ?? 1975.},

Just as Na+ gradients, imposed by Na+/K+ ATPases, energize basolateral plasma membranes of epithelia, so voltage gradients, imposed by H+ V-ATPases, energize apical plasma membranes. The energized membranes acidify or alkalinize compartments, absorb or secrete ions and fluids, and underwrite cellular homeostasis. V-ATPases acidify extracellular spaces of single cells such as phagocytes and osteoclasts and of polarized epithelia, such as vertebrate kidney and epididymis. They alkalinize extracellular spaces of lepidopteran midgut. V-ATPases energize fluid secretion by insect Malpighian tubules and fluid absorption by insect oocytes. They hyperpolarize external plasma membranes for Na+ uptake by amphibian skin and fish gills. Indeed, it is likely that ion uptake by osmotically active membranes of all fresh water organisms is energized by V-ATPases.

abstract = {The vertical flux and sedimentation rate of planktic foraminiferal tests are quantified and a global planktic foraminiferal CaCO3 budget is presented. Test and calcite flux rates are calculated according to the distribution of species obtained from multinet and sediment trap samples. Modern planktic foraminiferal population dynamics are discussed as a prerequisite for the quantification of the calcite budget, highlighting the importance of ecological, autecological (e.g., reproduction), and biogeochemical conditions that determine the presence or absence of species. To complete the open-marine, particulate CaCO3 inventory, the contribution of coccolithophores, pteropods, and calcareous dinophytes is discussed. Based on the studied regions, the global planktic foraminiferal calcite flux rate at 100 m depth amounts to 1.3–3.2 Gt yr−1, equivalent to 23–56{\%} of the total open marine CaCO3 flux. The preservation of tests varies on a regional and temporal scale, and is affected by local hydrography and dissolution. During most of the year (off-peak periods), many tests dissolve above 700-m water depth while settling through the water column, with on average only 1–3{\%} of the initially exported CaCO3 reaching the deep-seafloor. Pulsed flux events, mass dumps of fast settling particles, yield a major contribution of tests to the formation of deep-sea sediments. On average, ∼25{\%} of the initially produced planktic foraminiferal test CaCO3 settles on the seafloor. The total planktic foraminiferal contribution of CaCO3 to global surface sediments amounts to 0.36–0.88 Gt yr−1, ∼32–80{\%} of the total deep-marine calcite budget.},

Polarization of a synchrotron beam has been used to probe the local symmetry of empty states at each atomic site in this lamellar compound. A large polarization dependence is observed up to 20 eV above each edge. Peak behaviors lead to the identification of ?* and ?* resonances, as was already shown for graphite.

ToF-SIMS is also uniquely placed to become a powerful tool in this field due to its chemical specificity and the ability to perform high spatial resolution imaging. In this paper advances in single cell imaging at a sub-cellular level in 2D and 3D are explored using a novel SIMS instrument based on a buncher-ToF configuration, the J105 3D Chemical Imager. The data shows molecular localisation on a sub-cellular scale, over a suitable timeframe, whilst sustaining high mass resolution. The cells are imaged using a 40 keV C60+ dc beam and a clear differentiation between the material within the nuclei and lipid membrane can be made. In addition challenges in data manipulation and interpretation are discussed. Investigation of cell preparation suggests that the frozen hydrated approach may be beneficial.

abstract = {Geochemical analyses of the carbonate tests calcified by foraminifera have provided much of the foundation for reconstructions of past ocean and climate conditions, and for chemostratigraphy. In particular, reconstructions of climate history (including temperature, salinity, and ice volume), ocean paleocirculation patterns, the carbon cycle, paleoproductivity, marine carbonate chemistry, and chemostratigraphy have relied on measurements of isotopic and trace element composition of foraminiferal calcium carbonate, and variations in these geochemical records through time and space. Substantial work has been done on details of traditional proxies (e.g., $\delta$18O, $\delta$13C) and on emerging proxies (e.g., $\delta$11B, $\epsilon$Nd) in recent years; hence, a new overview of these proxies provides a timely reference and educational tool. We review the geochemical proxies that utilize foraminiferal carbonate tests, including potential uses of the proxies for reconstructions through time: $\delta$18O, $\delta$13C, trace elements (Mg, Cd, Ba, Zn, B, U), 87Sr/86Sr, $\delta$26Mg, $\delta$11B, and $\epsilon$Nd. Both planktic and benthic foraminifera are included; planktic foraminifera provide information on the upper few hundred meters of the surface ocean, whereas benthic foraminifera provide information on conditions at the seafloor and in shallow porewaters, from shallow seas to deep ocean basins.},

abstract = {Thorium-234 is used in the Arabian Sea as a tracer of sinking particle fluxes. Samples were collected from January to August 1995 on four cruises during the Northeast Monsoon, the Spring Intermonsoon and the mid- and late-Southwest Monsoon periods. In this study, 234Th activity distributions are used to quantify the 234Th flux on sinking particles, and the measured ratio of particulate organic carbon (POC) to particulate 234Th is used to convert from 234Th to POC export at 100 m. The calculated POC fluxes range from {\textless} 1 to {\textgreater} 25 mmols C m -2 d -1, and strong seasonal and spatial gradients are observed. The single largest feature is a basin-wide export maximum associated with the late-SW Monsoon cruise when POC export rates are 17-28{\%} of the observed primary production rates along the southern sampling line. During all other cruises, this export ratio is {\textless} 2-10{\%}, with an increase near shore where POC fluxes are generally elevated. Also, during the Spring Intermonsoon, a POC export maximum is observed along the northern sampling line. Both this Spring export feature and late-SW Monsoon flux maximum appear to be associated with a phytoplankton community structure dominated by diatoms. The timing of the late-SW Monsoon flux peak agrees with the observed flux maximum in the deep moored time-series sediment traps (Honjo et al., 1998). This dramatic increase in export between the mid- and late-SW Monsoon also corresponds to measured decreases in the stocks of total organic C in the upper 150 m (Hansell and Peltzer, 1998) and a sharp decline in surface water Al and Fe (Measures and Vink, 1998). These 100 m flux results, plus a series of POC flux profiles, allow for a more complete understanding of the magnitude and timing of sub-euphotic zone export in the Arabian Sea.},

Four flocks of lambs and three flocks of ewes were protected only by blowfly traps, seven of the flocks of ewes and six flocks of lambs were protected by blowfly traps but also had proprietary insecticides applied to them at some stage. There was no difference in the abundance of L. sericata at the various sites. The highest incidence of strike was seen in the two control flocks where 10.9 and 5.8{\%} of the ewes and 10.1 and 9.2{\%} of the lambs were struck. Strike incidence in the flocks that used trapping only and flocks that used trapping plus a chemical preventive was on average five times lower than in the control flocks, but the percentages struck on the sites in the trapping only and trapping plus insecticide groups were not significantly different from each other. The results of this study show that traps can make an effective contribution to blowfly strike control on individual farms. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Calcite growth experiments have been performed in the presence of aqueous Mg at 25°C and 1bar pCO2 to quantify magnesium partition coefficient DMg=(Mg/Ca)solid(Mg/Ca)fluid and Mg isotope fractionation between calcite and reactive fluid ($\delta$26Mgcalcite-fluid) as a function of calcite precipitation rate rp (molm-2s-1). Mg partition coefficient, DMg, increases with calcite growth rate according to:LogDMg=0.2517(±0.0150)×Logrp+0.0944(±0.0182);R2=0.93,(10-8.3≤rp≤10-6.6molm-2s-1) $\delta$26Mgcalcite-fluid was found to depend heavily on calcite growth rate with preferential incorporation of 24Mg in calcite and the extent of isotope fractionation decreasing with increasing calcite growth rate in accord with:$\delta$26Mgcalcite-fluid=0.7918(±0.0452)×Logrp+3.2366(±0.3360);R2=0.97(10-8.3≤rp≤10-6.6molm-2s-1) The negative $\delta$26Mgcalcite-fluid values found in this study, with calcite overgrowths enriched in light Mg, are consistent with (i) recent experimental data on Mg isotope fractionation during low-Mg calcite homogeneous precipitation (Immenhauser et al., 2010) and magnesite growth (Pearce et al., 2012) and (ii) with theoretical values calculated for Mg-calcite by density-functional electronic structure models (Rustad et al., 2010). The deviation of the isotopic composition of precipitated Mg-calcite from the equilibrium mass fractionation line in a three isotope diagram is a linear function of calcite growth rate. The equilibrium $\delta$26Mgcalcite-fluid value at 25°C derived from this linear extrapolation, $\delta$26Mgcalcite-fluid=-3.5±0.2{\%} (2$\sigma$), is in good agreement with the theoretical value calculated by Rustad et al. (2010) for Mg-calcite ($\delta$26Mgcalcite-fluid=-3.6{\%}; BP86 functional). A striking feature of the results of this study is the decrease of the extent of Mg isotope fractionation (from -3.16{\%} to -1.88{\%}) with the increase of calcite precipitation rate (from 10-8.3 to 10-6.6molm-2s-1) which is opposite to the variation of Ca, Ba and Sr isotope fractionation with calcite precipitation rate. This behavior likely stems from the strong free energy of hydration of the Mg2+ ion compared to Ca2+, Ba2+ and Sr2+ which leads, during fast calcite growth, to the entrapment in calcite overgrowths of hydrated Mg ions whose isotopic composition is close to that of aqueous Mg2+. The strong dependence of Mg isotope fractionation on calcite growth rate suggests that, using the three isotopes method, Mg isotopic signatures of calcite in association with those of other divalent metals (Zn2+, Cu2+) have the potential to reveal mineral precipitation rates and thus environmental conditions of the oceans over geological time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {About one-third of the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity has been absorbed by the oceans, where it partitions into the constituent ions of carbonic acid. This leads to ocean acidification, one of the major threats to marine ecosystems and particularly to calcifying organisms such as corals, foraminifera and coccolithophores. Coccolithophores are abundant phytoplankton that are responsible for a large part of modern oceanic carbonate production. Culture experiments investigating the physiological response of coccolithophore calcification to increased CO(2) have yielded contradictory results between and even within species. Here we quantified the calcite mass of dominant coccolithophores in the present ocean and over the past forty thousand years, and found a marked pattern of decreasing calcification with increasing partial pressure of CO(2) and concomitant decreasing concentrations of CO(3)(2-). Our analyses revealed that differentially calcified species and morphotypes are distributed in the ocean according to carbonate chemistry. A substantial impact on the marine carbon cycle might be expected upon extrapolation of this correlation to predicted ocean acidification in the future. However, our discovery of a heavily calcified Emiliania huxleyi morphotype in modern waters with low pH highlights the complexity of assemblage-level responses to environmental forcing factors.},

abstract = {The distributions and seasonal variability of total dissolved Cu (TDCu) and Cu-complexing ligands in sediment pore waters have been investigated at two contrasting sites in the Chesapeake Bay. Two ligand classes, which differ on the basis of the conditional stability constants (K'(cond)) of their Cu complexes, were detected at all depths at both sites. At the sulfidic, muddy, mid-Bay Sta. M, concentrations and values of log K'(cond) ranged from 390-12,500 nM and ≥7.2-{\textgreater}8.9, respectively, for the stronger ligand class (L(1S)) and 75-6,420 nM and 6.2-7.9 for the weaker ligand class (L(2S)). At the bioturbated, sandy Sta. S in the lower Bay, respective concentrations and values of log K'(cond) ranged from 135-807 nM and ≥7.6-≥10.2 for L(1S) and 40-1,410 nM and 6.6-9.2 for L(2S). For comparison, one pore water profile from a slope station off of the Chesapeake Bay also showed the presence of two ligand classes, with respective concentrations and values of log K'(cond) of 140-270 nM and 8-{\textgreater}11 for L(1S) and 30-180 nM and 7-10 for L(2S). These ligands are in large excess relative to ambient TDCu concentrations ({\textless}0.1-24.3 nM), thereby maintaining very low inorganic Cu concentrations (typically {\textless}0.1 to {\textless}100 pM) and a high degree of organic complexation (87.2-{\textgreater}99.9{\%}) of Cu in Bay and slope sediment pore waters. Thus, virtually all TDCu fluxing from these sediments is complexed during sediment-water exchange. A relatively small fraction of the TDCu is exchanged as inorganic species, which are widely regarded as the most bioavailable form of Cu. Higher ligand concentrations at Sta. M suggest that sulfide or organic ligands containing reduced S contribute to the pool of complexing ligands; however, the exact nature and sources of the ligands in Bay pore waters are not known. The progressive increase in conditional stability constants of the CuL(2S) complexes from the mid-Bay to the slope sediments may reflect differences in biological or chemical processes at each site, as well as differences in the type of Cu-complexing organic matter. Total ligand concentrations (L(1S) + L(2S)) are 15 to {\textgreater}100 times higher in the upper intervals of the pore waters relative to ligand concentrations in the bottom waters of the Chesapeake Bay (30-60 nM), consistent with previous observations of fluxes of these ligands from the sediments to overlying waters. These results suggest that sediments are potentially significant sources of Cu-complexing ligands to the overlying waters of the Chesapeake Bay, and perhaps, other shallow water estuarine and coastal environments. Copper-complexing ligands released from sediment pore waters may play an important role in influencing Cu speciation in overlying waters. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

This has been shown to slow down calcification of major calcifying groups, such as corals, foraminifera, and coccolithophores. Here we show that two of the most productive marine calcifying species, the coccolithophores Coccolithus pelagicus and Calcidiscus leptoporus, do not follow the CO2-related calcification response previously found. In batch culture experiments, particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) of C. leptoporus changes with increasing CO2 concentration in a nonlinear relationship. A PIC optimum curve is obtained, with a maximum value at present-day surface ocean pCO(2) levels (similar to 360 ppm CO2). With particulate organic carbon (POC) remaining constant over the range of CO2 concentrations, the PIC/POC ratio also shows an optimum curve. In the C. pelagicus cultures, neither PIC nor POC changes significantly over the CO2 range tested, yielding a stable PIC/POC ratio. Since growth rate in both species did not change with pCO(2), POC and PIC production show the same pattern as POC and PIC. The two investigated species respond differently to changes in the seawater carbonate chemistry, highlighting the need to consider species-specific effects when evaluating whole ecosystem responses. Changes of calcification rate (PIC production) were highly correlated to changes in coccolith morphology. Since our experimental results suggest altered coccolith morphology ( at least in the case of C. leptoporus) in the geological past, coccoliths originating from sedimentary records of periods with different CO2 levels were analyzed. Analysis of sediment samples was performed on six cores obtained from locations well above the lysocline and covering a range of latitudes throughout the Atlantic Ocean. Scanning electron micrograph analysis of coccolith morphologies did not reveal any evidence for significant numbers of incomplete or malformed coccoliths of C. pelagicus and C. leptoporus in last glacial maximum and Holocene sediments. The discrepancy between experimental and geological results might be explained by adaptation to changing carbonate chemistry.},

abstract = {Small-scale heterogeneity of biogenic carbonate elemental composition can be a significant source of error in the accurate use of element/Ca ratios as geochemical proxies. In this study ion microprobe (SIMS) profiles showed significant small-scale variability of Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Mn/Ca ratios in new shell calcite of the marine bivalves Pecten maximus and Mytilus edulis that was precipitated during a constant-temperature culturing experiment. Elevated Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Mn/Ca ratios were found to be associated with the deposition of elaborate shell features, i.e. a shell surface stria in P. maximus and surface shell disturbance marks in both species, the latter a common occurrence in bivalve shells. In both species the observed small-scale elemental heterogeneity most likely was not controlled by variable transport of ions to the extra-pallial fluid, but by factors such as the influence of shell organic content and/or crystal size and orientation, the latter reflecting conditions at the shell crystalsolution interface. In the mid and innermost regions of the P. maximus shell the lack of significant small-scale variation of Mg/Ca ratios, which is consistent with growth at constant temperature, suggest a potential application as a palaeotemperature proxy. Cross-growth band element/Ca ratio profiles in the interior of bivalve shells may provide more promising palaeo-environmental tools than sampling from the outer region of bivalve shells.},

abstract = {An inhibitor of eIF-2a phosphorylation was identified in various plant species. The plant protein (termed PKI) specifically cross-reacts with monoclonal antiserum that recognizes the glycosylated, active form of a M(r) 87 kD protein analog (p67) from reticulocytes. Northern blot analysis using a probe to the reticulocyte inhibitor cDNA further supports the presence of analogous transcripts in plant tissue. PKI specifically inhibits the phosphorylation of the plant encoded eIF-2 alpha kinase (pPKR) as well as plant and human eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation. The interaction between PKI and pPKR is indicated by their copurification on dsRNA agarose, despite evidence showing that PKI does not bind dsRNA. Further, wheat PKI inhibits human PKR phosphorylation but activity is recovered by immuno-depletion of PKI from wheat germ fractions. PKI is temporally regulated during plant growth and development. It is maximally present in extracts from dormant seeds, however, it is not detectable soon after leaf emergence at approximately 48 h post-imbibition. PKI levels are again detectable at the mid-milk stage in seed development. Protein levels of pPKR in ribosomal salt wash and cytosolic extracts from healthy plant tissue remain essentially constant throughout the life cycle. In contrast, pPKR activity levels based upon autophosphorylation vary significantly and are inversely correlated with PKI protein levels. Phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha is a classical mechanism for the downregulation of protein synthesis suggesting that inhibition of pPKR activity by PKI may contribute to the dramatic and rapid increase in protein synthesis observed during seed germination.},

abstract = {The impact of ocean acidification on key ocean calcifiers is predicted to be imminent, particularly in high-latitude ecosystems. Long-term field observations are essential to ground truth predictions of change in regional ecosystems. Here, we report on aragonitic pteropods collected to sediment traps at 800 m depth at 54°S, 140°E in the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) of the Southern Ocean from 1997 to 2007. Statistically significant trends were not identified in either mass or number flux from 1997 to 2007; however, differences emerged in decadal trends seen in shell weight for each of the three common taxa collected: Limacina helicina antarctica forma antarctica shells became significantly lighter (P {\textless} 0.05), L. retroversa australis shells became significantly heavier (P {\textless} 0.05) and L. helicina antarctica forma rangi shells did not change significantly. These results suggest that factors other than ocean acidification affect pteropod population variations on decadal timescales, with the potential to either amplify or counter the impact of decreasing aragonite saturation state, at least in the short term. Comparison to sea surface temperature and chlorophyll biomass did not identify these as significant drivers of the observed changes, and attribution across these multiple variables requires better understanding of pteropod physiology and ecology. Our PFZ pelagic pteropod observations provide a reference for evaluation of southern polar pteropod responses to changing ocean conditions in coming decades. Importantly, these data also raise the issue of taxonomic care when monitoring the region for impacts of ocean acidification on calcifiers.},

Ion pairing constants for the interaction of borate ion with Ca2+ and Mg2+ were also determined from I = 0.5 to 6 m and values were extrapolated to pure water. These interactions are weak and the pK's in water and in NaCl solution are in reasonable agreement with values of other workers. Pitzer terms ($\beta$[MA]Cl0) for the interaction of [MA] ion pairs with Cl- were also determined. The pKHA{\{}black star{\}} data can be fitted within experimental error with one less parameter using the combined ion pairing/Pitzer approach than when using the Pitzer formalism alone.

abstract = {Diffusion of (14)C-labeled CO(2) was measured through lipid bilayer membranes composed of egg lecithin and cholesterol (1:1 mol ratio) dissolved in n-decane. The results indicate that CO(2), but not HCO(3-), crosses the membrane and that different steps in the transport process are rate limiting under different conditions. In one series of experiments we studied one-way fluxes between identical solutions at constant pCO(2) but differing [HCO(3-)] and pH. In the absence of carbonic anhydrase (CA) the diffusion of CO(2) through the aqueous unstirred layers is rate limiting because the uncatalyzed hydration-dehydration of CO(2) is too slow to permit the high [HCO(3-)] to facilitate tracer diffusion through the unstirred layers. Addition of CA (ca. 1 mg/ml) to both bathing solutions causes a 10-100-fold stimulation of the CO(2) flux, which is proportional to [HCO(3-)] over the pH range 7-8. In the presence of CA the hydration- dehydration reaction is so fast that CO(2) transport across the entire system is rate limited by diffusion of HCO(3-) through unstirred layers. However, in the presence of CA when the ratio [HCO(3-) + CO(3=)]:[CO(2)] more than 1,000 (pH 9-10) the CO(2) flux reaches a maximum value. Under these conditions the diffusion of CO(2) through the membrane becomes rate limiting, which allows us to estimate a permeability coefficient of the membrane to CO(2) of 0.35 cm s(-1). In a second series of experiments we studied the effects of CA and buffer concentration on the net flux of CO(2). CA stimulates the net CO(2) flux in well buffered, but no in unbuffered, solutions. The buffer provides a proton source on the upstream side of the membrane and proton sink on the downstream side, thus allowing HCO(3-) to facilitate the net transport of CO(2) through the unstirred layers.},

abstract = {The public health and economic significance of malaria is enormous, and its control remains a great challenge. Many established malaria control methods are hampered by drug resistance and insecticide-resistant vectors. Malaria control measures built around environmental management are non-toxic, cost-effective, and sustainable. However, there has been no comprehensive review of the literature or meta-analysis examining the effect of these interventions. We therefore did a systematic literature review and identified 40 studies that emphasised environmental management interventions and reported clinical malaria variables as outcome measures. Of these 40 studies, environmental modification (measures aiming to create a permanent or long-lasting effect on land, water, or vegetation to reduce vector habitats--eg, the installation and maintenance of drains) was the central feature in 27 studies, environmental manipulation (methods creating temporary unfavourable conditions for the vector--eg, water or vegetation management) in four, and nine quantified the effect of modifications of human habitation. Most of the studies (n=34, 85{\%}) were implemented before the Global Malaria Eradication Campaign (1955-69), which mainly relied on indoor residual spraying with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). In 16 studies that applied environmental modification and in eight studies on modification of human habitation, the risk ratio of malaria was reduced by 88.0{\%} (95{\%} CI 81.7-92.1) and 79.5{\%} (95{\%} CI 67.4-87.2), respectively. We conclude that malaria control programmes that emphasise environmental management are highly effective in reducing morbidity and mortality. Lessons learned from these past successful programmes can inspire sound and sustainable malaria control approaches and strategies.},

abstract = {Boron is an essential element for vascular plants and for diatoms, cyanobacteria, and a number of species of marine algal flagellates. Boron was recently established as an essential micronutrient for frogs (Xenopus laevis) and preliminary evidence suggests that it may be essential for all animals. The main form of B, which is available in the natural environment, is in the form of undissociated boric acid. The permeability coefficient and the mechanism of transport of boric acid, however, have not been experimentally determined across any animal membrane or cell. In the experiments described here, the permeability coefficient of boric acid in Xenopus oocytes was 1.5 x 10(-6) cm/s, which is very close with the permeability across liposomes made with phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (the major lipids in the oocyte membrane). Moreover, we investigated the mechanism of boric acid movement across the membrane of Xenopus oocytes and we compared it with the transport across artificial liposomes. The transport of boric acid across Xenopus oocytes was not affected by inhibitors such as HgCl2, phloretin, or 4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-D-sulfonic acid (DIDS). The kinetics of B uptake was linear with concentration changes, and the permeability remained the same at different external boric acid concentrations. These results suggest that B transport occurs via simple passive diffusion through the lipid bilayer in Xenopus oocytes.},

abstract = {Environmental stressors such as increased sea surface temperatures are well-known for contributing to coral bleaching; however, the effect of increased temperatures and subsequent bleaching on coral-associated microbial communities is poorly understood. Colonies of the hard coral Acropora millepora were tagged on a reef flat off Magnetic Island (Great Barrier Reef) and surveyed over 2.5 years, which included a severe bleaching event in January/February 2002. Daily average water temperatures exceeded the previous 10-year average by more than 1 1C for extended periods with field-based visual surveys recording all tagged colonies displaying signs of bleaching. During the bleaching period, direct counts of coral zooxanthellae densities decreased by B64{\%}, before recovery to pre-bleaching levels after the thermal stress event. A subset of three tagged coral colonies were sampled through the bleaching event and changes in the microbial community elucidated. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis demonstrated conserved bacterial banding profiles between the three coral colonies, confirming previous studies high-lighting specific microbial associations. As coral colonies bleached, the microbial community shifted and redundancy analysis (RDA) of DGGE banding patterns revealed a correlation of increasing temperature with the appearance of Vibrio-affiliated sequences. Interestingly, this shift to a Vibrio-dominated community commenced prior to visual signs of bleaching. Clone libraries hybridized with Vibrio-specific oligonucleotide probes confirmed an increase in the fraction of Vibrio-affiliated clones during the bleaching period. Post bleaching, the coral microbial associations again shifted, returning to a profile similar to the fingerprints prior to bleaching. This provided further evidence for corals selecting and shaping their microbial partners. For non-bleached samples, a close association with Spongiobacter-related sequences were revealed by both clone libraries and DGGE profiling. Despite Vibrio species being previously implicated in bleaching of specific coral species, it is unsure if the relative increase in retrieved Vibrio sequences is due to bacterial infection or an opportunistic response to compromised health and changing environ-mental parameters of the coral host. This study provides the first molecular-based study demonstrating changes in coral-associated bacterial assemblages during a bleaching event on a natural reef system.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the evolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations throughout the Earth's history is important for a reconstruction of the links between climate and radiative forcing of the Earth's surface temperatures. Although atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Cenozoic era (about 60 Myr ago) are widely believed to have been higher than at present, there is disagreement regarding the exact carbon dioxide levels, the timing of the decline and the mechanisms that are most important for the control of CO2 concentrations over geological timescales. Here we use the boron-isotope ratios of ancient planktonic foraminifer shells to estimate the pH of surface-layer sea water throughout the past 60 million years, which can be used to reconstruct atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We estimate CO2 concentrations of more than 2,000 p.p.m. for the late Palaeocene and earliest Eocene periods (from about 60 to 52 Myr ago), and find an erratic decline between 55 and 40 Myr ago that may have been caused by reduced CO2 outgassing from ocean ridges, volcanoes and metamorphic belts and increased carbon burial. Since the early Miocene (about 24 Myr ago), atmospheric CO2 concentrations appear to have remained below 500 p.p.m. and were more stable than before, although transient intervals of CO2 reduction may have occurred during periods of rapid cooling approximately 15 and 3 Myr ago.},

abstract = {The elemental composition of phytoplankton is a fusion of the evolutionary history of the host and plastid, resulting in differences in genetic constraints and selection pressures associated with environmental conditions. The evolutionary inheritance hypothesis predicts similarities in elemental composition within related taxonomic lineages of phytoplankton. To test this hypothesis, we measured the elemental composition (C, N, P, S, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co, Cd and Mo) of 14 phytoplankton species and combined these with published data from 15 more species from both marine and freshwater environments grown under nutrient-replete conditions. The largest differences in the elemental profiles of the species distinguish between the prokaryotic Cyanophyta and primary endosymbiotic events that resulted in the green and red plastid lineages. Smaller differences in trace element stoichiometry within the red and green plastid lineages are consistent with changes in trace elemental stoichiometry owing to the processes associated with secondary endosymbioses and inheritance by descent with modification.},

We conducted a CO2 manipulation experiment in the Sea of Okhotsk in summer 2006 to investigate the response of the phytoplankton assemblage and dynamics of organic carbon. During the 14-day incubation of nutrient-depleted surface water with a natural phytoplankton assemblage under 150, 280, 480, and 590$\mu$atm pCO2, the relative abundance of fucoxanthin-containing phytoplankton such as diatoms and prymnesiophytes decreased with increasing pCO2. The amount of DOC accumulation also decreased with increasing pCO2, while differences in POC accumulation between the treatments were small and did not show a clear trend with the pCO2. Change in the phytoplankton community composition under different pCO2 conditions will alter the organic carbon dynamics as found in the present experiment. Compared to results in the literature from nutrient-replete conditions indicating a potential enhancement of phytoplankton production with elevated pCO2, the present results indicated a different physiological response of phytoplankton under nutrient-depleted conditions. These results indicate that the continuing increase in atmospheric CO2 can significantly affect the structure of marine ecosystems and carbon cycle in nutrient- depleted subpolar surface waters.},

abstract = {Vectors play a critical role in the ecology of infectious disease by facilitating between host transmission, emphasizing the multi-species nature of disease. Corals are suffering an onslaught of infectious diseases, yet we know little about the role of vector species in the ecology of these epizootics. The infection of octocorals by the fungus Aspergillus sydowii is a widespread Caribbean coral disease. The snail Cyphoma gibbosum is a likely vector species because it is a specialist predator of octocorals, moves regularly among coral colonies, and aggregates on diseased corals. We used a novel application of stable isotope techniques and antifungal-resistant strains of A. sydowii to identify the potential for this snail to vector disease. The use of both isotopically labeled and hygromycin-resistant fungus was successful in definitively tracing A. sydowii through the guts of C. gibbosum from ingestion to feces. Further, we demonstrated in laboratory experiments that snails fed antifungal-resistant A. sydowii excrete viable spores and hyphae in their feces. Overall, this study demonstrates the usefulness of isotopic labeling and antifungal-resistant fungi to trace the movement of pathogen propagules in microbially diverse environments, and suggests that C. gibbosum may be able to spread aspergillosis between octocoral hosts.},

These nanoparticles assemble at the template and, after reaching a critical size, develop dynamic crystalline domains, one of which is selectively stabilized by the template.

This paper assesses whether there is room to reduce inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus fertiliser applications and imported feeds by exploring the extent to which application rates may have exceeded optimum levels using data envelopment analysis methodology. The investigation concentrates on specialist dairy and tillage farms in the Republic of Ireland stratified by land use potential as these agricultural systems are the most intensive and may pose the greatest risk in terms of managing nutrient transfers from agricultural land to water bodies. Results demonstrate inefficiency in the utilisation of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers across these systems. Second stage regression analysis indicates significant return to efficiency from agricultural education. Average over application of chemical fertilizers ranged from 22.8 to 32.8kg Nha-1 and 2.9 to 3.51kg Pha-1 in 2008 which research has shown is at least similar and greater than losses to leaching and runoff for N and P, respectively, from similar intensive agricultural land uses. Potential cost savings on chemical fertilisers across all systems on average ranged from ???38.9ha-1 to ???48.5ha-1. Additionally, potential cost reductions on imported feeds of ???65-84 per livestock were indicated for dairy farms versus efficient cohort benchmark farms. Average excess of imported feedstuffs equated to 5.82-7.44kgLU-1 of N and 0.92-1.17kgLU-1 of P. Such reductions have the potential to deliver a double dividend by reducing the risk of diffuse nutrient losses from agricultural land while improving economic margins at farm level. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the deep-sea, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) is often marked by clay-rich condensed intervals caused by dissolution of carbonate sediments, capped by a carbonate-rich interval. Constraining the duration of both the dissolution and subsequent cap-carbonate intervals is essential to computing marine carbon fluxes and thus testing hypotheses for the origin of this event. To this end, we provide new high-resolution helium isotope records spanning the Paleocene-Eocene boundary at ODP Site 1266 in the South Atlantic. The extraterrestrial 3He, 3HeET, concentrations replicate trends observed at ODP Site 690 by Farley and Eltgroth (2003). By assuming a constant flux of 3HeET we constrain relative changes in accumulation rates of sediment across the PETM and construct a new age model for the event. In this new chronology the zero carbonate layer represents 35kyr, some of which reflects clay produced by dissolution of Paleocene (pre-PETM) sediments. Above this layer, carbonate concentrations increase for ???165kyr and remain higher than in the latest Paleocene until 234 +48/-34kyr above the base of the clay. The new chronology indicates that minimum ??13C values persisted for a maximum of 134 +27/-19kyr and the inflection point previously chosen to designate the end of the CIE recovery occurs at 217 +44/-31kyr. This allocation of time differs from that of the cycle-based age model of R??hl et al. (2007) in that it assigns more time to the clay layer followed by a more gradual recovery of carbonate-rich sedimentation. The new model also suggests a longer sustained ??13C excursion followed by a more rapid recovery to pre-PETM ??13C values. These differences have important implications for constraining the source(s) of carbon and mechanisms for its subsequent sequestration, favoring models that include a sustained release of carbon after an initial pulse. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Impact glasses from the K/T boundary in Haiti include high-Ca glasses with up to 1 wt.{\%} SO3, formed by the fusion of anhydrite- or gypsum-rich evaporite sediments in the presence of high-silica melts, derived from melting of continental crust. Experimental studies have duplicated these two melts by fusion of gypsum and andesite, and suggest a formation temperature of 1300??C. Geochemical evidence from the glasses is consistent with their derivation from the 180 km diameter Chicxulub impact crater on the Yucatan peninsula (Mexico), situated in a thick late Cretaceous evaporite succession. This large-diameter crater is most likely the result of a cometary impact, on the basis of bolide scaling from the Ir anomaly in K/T boundary sediments. The sulfur degassing associated with formation of the high-Ca glass alone could have formed a 2 ?? 1016 g H2SO4 stratospheric aerosol. However, the total sulfur degassing from the evaporite-rich sediments in the Chicxulub impact site may have led to formation of 3.8 ?? 1018 to 1.3 ?? 1019 g sulfate aerosol, and global atmospheric mass loading from the sulfate aerosol alone is estimated to beof the order of 1-2.6 g cm-2. Combined with the great optical depth estimates of Pollack et al. [1] and Covey et al. [2] resulting from an impact "dust" cloud, the sulfate aerosol may have contributed not only to a rapid decline in global surface temperatures to near-freezing in about one week, but also prolonged the cooling for several years because of the time-dependent conversion of SO2 to H2SO4 aerosol in the atmosphere. The contribution of sulfur to acid rain following the K/T boundary event may have equalled the proposed rainout of nitric acid. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Drill cores obtained from Lake Pet??n Itz??, Pet??n, Guatemala, contain a ???85-kyr record of terrestrial climate from lowland Central America that was used to reconstruct hydrologic changes in the northern Neotropics during the last glaciation. Sediments are composed of alternating clay and gypsum reflecting relatively wet and dry climate conditions, respectively. From ???85 to 48 ka, sediments were dominated by carbonate clay indicating moist conditions during Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5a, 4, and early 3. The first gypsum layer was deposited at ???48 ka, signifying a shift toward drier hydrologic conditions and the onset of wet-dry oscillations. During the latter part of MIS 3, Pet??n climate varied between wetter conditions during interstadials and drier states during stadials. The pattern of clay-gypsum (wet-dry) oscillations during the latter part of MIS 3 (???48-23 ka) closely resembles the temperature records from Greenland ice cores and North Atlantic marine sediment cores and precipitation proxies from the Cariaco Basin. The most arid periods coincided with Heinrich Events when cold sea surface temperatures prevailed in the North Atlantic, meridional overturning circulation was reduced, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) was displaced southward. A thick clay unit was deposited from 23 to 18 ka suggesting deposition in a deep lake, and pollen accumulated during the same period indicates vegetation consisted of a temperate pine-oak forest. This finding contradicts previous inferences that climate was arid during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) chronozone (21??2 ka). At ???18 ka, Pet??n climate switched from moist to arid conditions and remained dry from 18 to 14.7 ka during the early deglaciation. Moister conditions prevailed during the warmer Bolling-Allerod (14.7-12.8 ka) with the exception of a brief return to dry conditions at ???13.8 ka that coincides with the Older Dryas and meltwater pulse 1A. The onset of the Younger Dryas at 12.8 ka marked the return of gypsum and hence dry conditions. The lake continued to precipitate gypsum until ???10.3 ka when rainfall increased markedly in the early Holocene. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here, we show that the bioavailability of dissolved Fe may decline because of ocean acidification. Acidification of media containing various Fe compounds decreases the Fe uptake rate of diatoms and coccolithophores to an extent predicted by the changes in Fe chemistry. A slower Fe uptake by a model diatom with decreasing pH is also seen in experiments with Atlantic surface water. The Fe requirement of model phytoplankton remains unchanged with increasing CO2. The ongoing acidification of seawater is likely to increase the Fe stress of phytoplankton populations in some areas of the ocean.},

abstract = {Many angiosperms employ self-incompatibility systems to prevent inbreeding. The simple genetics of such systems have made them attractive models of plant cellular communication. Implicit in the single locus genetics is that only one or a few gene products are necessary for recognition and rejection of incompatible pollen. Results in the sporophytic system of the Brassicaceae suggest that different S-locus products are responsible for the pollen and pistil parts of the recognition and rejection response. In solanaeceous plants, which have a gametophytic self-incompatibility system, the S locus product responsible for the pollen portion of the interaction has not been identified, but ribonucleases encoded by the S-locus (S-RNases) are strongly implicated in the style part of the recognition and rejection reaction. In Nicotiana alata, pollen recognition and rejection occur if its S-allele matches either S-allele in the style. The putative stylar S-RNase is abundant in the transmitting tract, and pollen rejection may be related to action of S-RNase on pollen RNAs. Efforts to understand the molecular basis for pollen recognition and rejection have been limited by the lack of a system for manipulating and expressing S-RNases. Here we use the promoter of a style-expressed gene from tomato to obtain high levels of S-RNase expression in transgenic Nicotiana. Recognition and rejection of N. alata pollen S-alleles occur faithfully in the transgenic plants. Our results show that S-RNases alone are sufficient for pollen rejection in this system.},

abstract = {Approximately one-quarter of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere each year is absorbed by the global oceans, causing measurable declines in surface ocean pH, carbonate ion concentration ([CO32−]), and saturation state of carbonate minerals (Ω)1. This process, referred to as ocean acidification, represents a major threat to marine ecosystems, in particular marine calcifiers such as oysters, crabs, and corals. Laboratory and field studies2,3 have shown that calcification rates of many organisms decrease with declining pH, [CO32−], and Ω. Coral reefs are widely regarded as one of the most vulnerable marine ecosystems to ocean acidification, in part because the very architecture of the ecosystem is reliant on carbonate-secreting organisms4. Acidification-induced reductions in calcification are projected to shift coral reefs from a state of net accretion to one of net dissolution this century5. While retrospective studies show large-scale declines in coral, and community, calcification over recent decades6–12, determining the contribution of ocean acidification to these changes is difficult, if not impossible, owing to the confounding effects of other environmental factors such as temperature. Here we quantify the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to alkalinity enrichment, and show that, when ocean chemistry is restored closer to pre-industrial conditions, net community calcification increases. In providing results from the first seawater chemistry manipulation experiment of a natural coral reef community, we provide evidence that net community calcification is depressed compared with values expected for pre- industrial conditions, indicating that ocean acidification may already be impairing coral reef growth.},

Magnesium within the crystals of calcite forms a solid solution over the compositional range investigated. The principal axes of vibration ellipsoids at -80 [degree]C resemble very closely those of calcite suggesting that the large thermal parameters in magnesium calcite reflect increased thermal vibrations more than positional disorder.

Here we report the X-ray structure of the spinach plasma membrane aquaporin SoPIP2;1 in its closed conformation at 2.1 A resolution and in its open conformation at 3.9 A resolution, and molecular dynamics simulations of the initial events governing gating. In the closed conformation loop D caps the channel from the cytoplasm and thereby occludes the pore. In the open conformation loop D is displaced up to 16 A and this movement opens a hydrophobic gate blocking the channel entrance from the cytoplasm. These results reveal a molecular gating mechanism which appears conserved throughout all plant plasma membrane aquaporins.},

abstract = {The chemical and isotopic composition of pore fluids is presented for five deep-rooted mud volcanoes aligned on a transect across the Gulf of Cadiz continental margin at water depths between 350 and 3860 m. Generally decreasing interstitial Li concentrations and 87Sr/86Sr ratios with increasing distance from shore are attributed to systematically changing fluid sources across the continental margin. Although highest Li concentrations at the near-shore mud volcanoes coincide with high salinities derived from dissolution of halite and late-stage evaporites, clayey, terrigenous sediments are identified as the ultimate Li source to all pore fluids investigated. Light ??7Li values, partly close to those of hydrothermal vent fluids (??7Li: +11.9???), indicate that Li has been mobilized during high-temperature fluid/sediment or fluid/rock interactions in the deep sub-surface. Intense leaching of terrigenous clay has led to radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr ratios (???0.7106) in pore fluids of the near-shore mud volcanoes. In contrast, non-radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr ratios (???0.7075) at the distal locations are attributed to admixing of a basement-derived fluid component, carrying an isotopic signature from interaction with the basaltic crust. This inference is substantiated by temperature constraints from Li isotope equilibrium calculations suggesting exchange processes at particularly high temperatures ({\textgreater}200 ??C) for the least radiogenic pore fluids of the most distal location. Advective pore fluids in the off-shore reaches of the Gulf of Cadiz are influenced by successive exchange processes with both oceanic crust and terrigenous, fine-grained sediments, resulting in a chemical and isotopic signature similar to that of fluids in near-shore ridge flank hydrothermal systems. This suggests that deep-rooted mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz represent a fluid pathway intermediate between mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal vent and shallow, marginal cold seep. Due to the thicker sediment coverage and slower fluid advection rates, the overall geochemical signature is shifted towards the sediment-diagenetic signal compared to ridge flank hydrothermal environments. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We review one of the most ancient of all the global biogeochemical cycles and one which reflects the profound geochemical and biological changes that have occurred as the Earth system has evolved through time - that of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). In particular, we highlight a Mid-Mesozoic Revolution in the nature and location of carbonate deposition in the marine environment, driven by the ecological success of calcareous plankton. This drove the creation of a responsive deep-sea sedimentary sink of CaCO3. The result is that biologically driven carbonate deposition provides a significant buffering of ocean chemistry and of atmospheric CO2 in the modern system. However, the same calcifying organisms that under-pin the deep-sea carbonate sink are now threatened by the continued atmospheric release of fossil fuel CO2 and increasing acidity of the surface ocean. We are not yet in a position to predict what the impact on CaCO3 production will be, or how the uptake of fossil fuel CO2 by the ocean will be affected. This uncertainty in the future trajectory of atmospheric CO2 that comes from incomplete understanding of the marine carbonate cycle is cause for concern. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Changes in the morphology and orientation of crystals have been tracked across the nacreous layer in pterioid bivalves, by SEM and X-ray diffraction. Early crystals nucleated on the organic membrane usually covering the outer prismatic layer. They formed polycrystalline aggregates of various shapes, first at prism boundaries and progressively invading the prisms in a centripetal fashion. Their c-axes were perpendicular to the substrate, but the a- and b-axis were variously arranged. As they grew, nacreous crystals became individualized and acquired a common crystallographic orientation also in the a-b plane (with the b-axis in the direction of shell growth). Initial lamellae had well delineated growth fronts, which later changed to diffuse. The increasing orientation was explained by a competition model between nacreous plates within the growing lamellae, which was particularly effective in lamellae with delineated fronts. This competition between adjacent crystals could not take place in gastropod nacre because, contrary to the stepped mode of growth of bivalve nacre, vertical stacking predominated. Our model is an alternative to the heteroepitaxial model where the organic matrix supposedly acted as an orienting template, but is nevertheless compatible with the mineral bridge hypothesis that implied epitaxial growth of stacking nacreous tablets. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An increase in whole ocean alkalinity during glacial periods could account, in part, for the drawdown of atmospheric CO2 into the ocean. Such an increase was inevitable due to the near elimination of shelf area for the burial of coral reef alkalinity. We present evidence, based on downcore measurements of benthic foraminiferal B/Ca and Mg/Ca from a core in the Weddell Sea, that the deep ocean carbonate ion concentration, [CO32{\&}{\#}8722;], was elevated by {\&}{\#}8764;25 {\&}{\#}956;mol/kg during each glacial period of the last 800 kyr. The heterogeneity of the preservation histories in the different ocean basins reflects control of the carbonate chemistry of the deep glacial ocean in the Atlantic and Pacific by the changing ventilation and chemistry of Weddell Sea waters. These waters are more corrosive than interglacial northern sourced waters but not as undersaturated as interglacial southern sourced waters. Our inferred increase in whole ocean alkalinity can be reconciled with reconstructions of glacial saturation horizon depth and the carbonate budget if carbonate burial rates also increased above the saturation horizon as a result of enhanced pelagic calcification. The Weddell records display low [CO32{\&}{\#}8722;] during deglaciations and peak interglacial warmth, coincident with maxima in percent CaCO3 in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Should the burial rate of alkalinity in the more alkaline glacial deep waters outstrip the rate of alkalinity supply, then pelagic carbonate production by the coccolithophores at the end of the glacial maximum could drive a decrease in ocean [CO32{\&}{\#}8722;] and act to trigger the deglacial rise in pCO2.},

abstract = {The major protein component of the extrapallial fluid of the mollusc Mytilus edulis has been previously isolated and partially characterized. It was postulated to play a role in shell mineralization because of its intriguing property of Ca(2+)-binding-induced self-assembling. However, it also binds other divalent ions, including Cd(2+), Cu(2+), Mn(2+), and Mg(2+). Herein is the initial report on the characterization of the primary structure of the extrapallial (EP) protein by RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing methods and by de novo peptide sequencing with mass spectrometry. The EP protein is comprised of 213 amino acids postcleavage of a signal peptide of 23 amino acids. The protein is rich in His, Glu, and Asp residues. The site of N-glycosylation, "NHTE", at amino acid positions 54-57 and the intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys 139 and Cys 171 of the protein have been characterized also. Sequence comparisons reveal that the EP protein possesses little homology to any presently known matrix proteins previously isolated from mollusc shells but rather it highly resembles a heavy metal binding protein and a histidine-rich glycoprotein, both from the hemolymph of M. edulis. The predicted domain profile and amino acid composition suggest that its N-terminus may be involved in calcium binding. The abundance of histidine residues of the protein may account for its heavy metal binding properties. Thus, the EP protein perhaps has multiple functions, serving as a Ca(2+)-transport protein, a shell matrix protein, and a heavy metal detoxification protein.},

abstract = {Instead of having been more or less constant, as once assumed, it is now apparent that the major ion chemistry of the oceans has varied substantially over time. For instance, independent lines of evidence suggest that calcium concentration ([Ca2+]) has approximately halved and magnesium concentration ([Mg2+]) approximately doubled over the last 100 million years. On the other hand, the calcite compensation depth, and hence the CaCO3 saturation, has varied little over the last 100 My as documented in deep sea sediments. We combine these pieces of evidence to develop a proxy for seawater carbonate ion concentration ([CO32-]) over this period of time. From the calcite saturation state (which is proportional to the product of [Ca2+] times [CO32-], but also affected by [Mg2+]), we can calculate seawater [CO32-]. Our results show that [CO32-] has nearly quadrupled since the Cretaceous. Furthermore, by combining our [CO32-] proxy with other carbonate system proxies, we provide calculations of the entire seawater carbonate system and atmospheric CO2. Based on this, reconstructed atmospheric CO2 is relatively low in the Miocene but high in the Eocene. Finally, we make a strong case that seawater pH has increased over the last 100 My.

However, solution neutron and X-ray diffraction indicate that even di- and tri-valent ions do not significantly alter the density or orientation of water more than two water molecules (5????) away. Therefore the long range electric fields (generated by simple ions) which can be detected by various resonance techniques such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer over distances of 30???? (about 11 water diameters) or more must be weak relative to the strength of water-water interactions. Two different techniques indicate that the interaction of water with anions is by an approximately linear hydrogen bond, suggesting that the dominant forces on ions in water are short range forces of a chemical nature. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The in situ specific growth rate of the nanoplankton species Emiliania huxleyi can be successfully derived from analysis of diel DNA synthesis patterns. Calculated growth rates (mu DNA) were in close agreement with growth rates determined from cell counts in laboratory cultures of E. huxleyi. For E, huxleyi populations in large outdoor enclosures (temp. = 7.9 to 10.2 degrees C), mu(DNA) ranged from 0.36 to 0.76 d(-1). Combining data on (net) changes in cell number of the enclosed populations with the calculated mu(DNA) values provided information on the total specific loss rates of E. huxleyi (caused by grazing, viral infections and autolysis). The initial and mid-exponential phases of E. huxleyi blooming were characterized by relatively high mu(DNA) values. At a later stage, following the depletion of nutrients in the water, mu(DNA) decreased. Specific loss rates ranged from 0.07 to 0.63 d(-1) and no particular trend in time was noticeable. E. huxleyi populations in enclosures with different phosphate loadings did not show significant differences in mu(DNA); in contrast, differences in loss rates were indisputable. Loss rates were low (0.07 to 0.35 d(-1)) in fertilized enclosures with low and intermediate phosphate concentrations, allowing extensive E, huxleyi blooming. In the fertilized enclosure with high phosphate loadings (PO4 {\textgreater} 2.6 mmol m(-3)) and in the unfertilized oligotrophic enclosure losses were high (0.33 to 0.63 d(-1)) preventing blooming of E. huxleyi. We concluded that nutrients were not limiting gross E. huxleyi growth but that they affected E. huxleyi losses by changing the phytoplankton composition and biomass.},

abstract = {Biologically formed hard tissues, referred to as biominerals, have intrigued the materials engineering community for years because of the high degree of crystallographic control that is exerted during the precipitation of the bioinorganic crystals. In recent years, there has been a shift in attention, from prior studies that focused on specific organic-inorganic interactions that modulate the crystal morphology via the conventional crystal- lization pathway, to recent studies that find that many biom- inerals are formed via an amorphous precursor pathway. It has become clear that the things we thought we had learned about biominerals before may or may not be relevant to truly understanding the mechanisms involved in biomineralization. Having witnessed this paradigm shift first hand, I am inclined to provide a review from this historical perspective, where I hope to belay some ideas about where we were, where we are, and where we are going, with respect to understanding how these shells and other biominerals are formed. Therefore, one goal of this review is to try and provide a link between the prior literature and the new literature, which might be useful to newcomers in the field, whom I suspect may find it confusing and difficult to integrate the findings in these different types of studies across this time period. A second goal is to try and integrate some of the knowledge obtained from in Vitro model systems, which can be more amenable to obtaining mechanistic information, with the in ViVo and ex ViVo observational studies on biominerals. A third goal is to demonstrate that there may be certain unifying principles found in biomineral systems that seem widely diverse, such as diatoms, mollusk shells, and vertebrate bones and teeth. A final goal (the not so hidden agenda), is to demonstrate not only that there is as strong a likelihood that many biominerals are formed by an amorphous precursor but also that the amorphous phase may possess fluidic properties that impart new processing capabilities to the system. Of course, those who know my work will readily assess that I am referring to the polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) process, which has been a primary focus in my laboratory. Along these lines, some new hypotheses are presented regarding the morphogenesis of certain biominerals, such as mollusk nacre, kidney stones, and bones and teeth, along with a review of the literature that provides support to these new ideas. The intent is to stimulate thoughtful discussions in this rapidly emerging area, which seemingly provides a unifying principle in biomineralization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide by 36{\%} during the past 200 years. One third of all anthropogenic CO(2) has been absorbed by the oceans, reducing pH by about 0.1 of a unit and significantly altering their carbonate chemistry. There is widespread concern that these changes are altering marine habitats severely, but little or no attention has been given to the biota of estuarine and coastal settings, ecosystems that are less pH buffered because of naturally reduced alkalinity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address CO(2)-induced changes to estuarine calcification, veliger larvae of two oyster species, the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and the Suminoe oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis) were grown in estuarine water under four pCO(2) regimes, 280, 380, 560 and 800 microatm, to simulate atmospheric conditions in the pre-industrial era, present, and projected future concentrations in 50 and 100 years respectively. CO(2) manipulations were made using an automated negative feedback control system that allowed continuous and precise control over the pCO(2) in experimental aquaria. Larval growth was measured using image analysis, and calcification was measured by chemical analysis of calcium in their shells. C. virginica experienced a 16{\%} decrease in shell area and a 42{\%} reduction in calcium content when pre-industrial and end of 21(st) century pCO(2) treatments were compared. C. ariakensis showed no change to either growth or calcification. Both species demonstrated net calcification and growth, even when aragonite was undersaturated, a result that runs counter to previous expectations for invertebrate larvae that produce aragonite shells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that temperate estuarine and coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to the expected changes in water chemistry due to elevated atmospheric CO(2) and that biological responses to acidification, especially calcifying biota, will be species-specific and therefore much more variable and complex than reported previously.},

abstract = {The Water Framework Directive (WFD) has initiated a shift towards a targeted approach to implementation through its focus on river basin districts as management units and the natural ecological characteristics of waterbodies. Due to its role in eutrophication, phosphorus (P) has received considerable attention, resulting in a significant body of research, which now forms the evidence base for the programme of measures (POMs) adopted in WFD River Basin Management Plans (RBMP). Targeting POMs at critical sources areas (CSAs) of P could significantly improve environmental efficiency and cost effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies. This paper summarises the progress made towards targeting mitigation measures at CSAs in Irish catchments. A review of current research highlights that knowledge related to P export at field scale is relatively comprehensive however; the availability of site-specific data and tools limits widespread identification of CSA at this scale. Increasing complexity of hydrological processes at larger scales limits accurate identification of CSA at catchment scale. Implementation of a tiered approach, using catchment scale tools in conjunction with field-by-field surveys could decrease uncertainty and provide a more practical and cost effective method of delineating CSA in a range of catchments. Despite scientific and practical uncertainties, development of a tiered CSA-based approach to assist in the development of supplementary measures would provide a means of developing catchment-specific and cost-effective programmes of measures for diffuse P. The paper presents a conceptual framework for such an approach, which would have particular relevance for the development of supplementary measures in High Status Waterbodies (HSW). The cost and resources necessary for implementation are justified based on HSWs' value as undisturbed reference condition ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Three sets of model climate parameters are used to explore the robustness of the results and for traceability to earlier work. The model versions have climate sensitivity of 2.8-3.3C and predict atmospheric CO2 close to present observations. Six idealized total fossil fuel CO2 emissions scenarios are used to explore a range of 1,100-15,000 GtC total emissions and the effect of rate of emissions. Atmospheric CO2 approaches equilibrium in year 3000 at 420-5,660 ppmv, giving 1.5-12.5C global warming. The ocean is a robust carbon sink of up to 6.5 GtC year1. Under 'business as usual', the land becomes a carbon source around year 2100 which peaks at up to 2.5 GtC year1. Soil carbon is lost globally, boreal vegetation generally increases, whilst under extreme forcing, dieback of some tropical and sub-tropical vegetation occurs. Average ocean surface pH drops by up to 1.15 units. A Greenland ice sheet melt threshold of 2.6C local warming is only briefly exceeded if total emissions are limited to 1,100 GtC, whilst 15,000 GtC emissions cause complete Greenland melt by year 3000, contributing 7 m to sea level rise. Total sealevel rise, including thermal expansion, is 0.4-10 m in year 3000 and ongoing.

abstract = {A suite of elements (B, Na, Mg, S, K, Ca, V, Mn, Cr, Sr, and Ba) was measured in aragonitic shells of the estuarine bivalve Corbula amurensis, the Asian clam, using the Sensitive High-Resolution Ion MicroProbe with Reverse Geometry (SHRIMP RG). Our initial intent was to explore potential geochemical proxy relationships between shell chemistry and salinity (freshwater inflow) in northern San Francisco Bay (SFB). In the course of this study we observed variations in shell trace element to calcium ([M]/Ca) ratios that could only be attributed to internal biological processes. This paper discusses the nature and sources of internal trace element variability in C. amurensis shells related to the shell organic fraction and shell calcification rates. The average organic content of whole C. amurensis shells is 19{\%}. After treating whole powdered shells with an oxidative cleaning procedure to remove organic matter, shells contained on average 33{\%} less total Mg and 78{\%} less total Mn. Within our analytical uncertainty, Sr and Ba contents were unchanged by the removal of organic matter. These results show that aragonitic C. amurensis shells have a large component of non-lattice-bound Mg and Mn that probably contribute to the dissimilarity of [M]/Ca profiles among five same-sized shells. Non-lattice-bound trace elements could complicate the development and application of geochemical proxy relationships in bivalve shells. Because B, Ba and Sr occur exclusively in shell aragonite, they are good candidates for external proxy relationships. [M]/Ca ratios were significantly different in prismatic and nacreous aragonite and in two valves of the same shell that had different crystal growth rates. Some part of these differences can be attributed to non-lattice-bound trace elements associated with the organic fraction. The differences in [M]/Ca ratios were also consistent with the calcification rate-dependent ion transport model developed by Carr?? et al. [Carr?? M., Bentaleb I., Bruguier O., Ordinola E., Barrett N. T. and Fontugne M. (2006) Calcification rate influence on trace element concentrations in aragonitic bivalve shells: evidences and mechanisms. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 70, 4906-4920] which predicts that [M]/Ca ratios increase as calcification rates increase and Ca2+ channel specificity decreases. This result, in combination with the possibility that there were ontogenetic variations in growth rates among individuals younger than 2 years, underscores the need to develop an independent age model for C. amurensis shells. If growth-rate effects on lattice-bound [M]/Ca ratios can be constrained, it may yet be possible to develop high-resolution geochemical proxies for external solution chemistry in low-salinity regions of SFB.},

abstract = {The shells of rhynchonelliform brachiopods have an outer (primary) layer of acicular calcite and an inner (secondary) layer of calcite fibres which are parallel to the shell exterior. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveals that these fibres are composed of large triangular nanogranules of about 600-650 nm along their long axis. The nanogranules are composites of organic and inorganic components. As the shell grows, the fibres elongate with the calcite c-axis perpendicular to the fibre axis as demonstrated by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Thus, despite being a composite structure comprising granules that are themselves composites, each fibre is effectively a single crystal. The combination of AFM and EBSD reveals the details of the structure and crystallography of these fibres. This knowledge serves to identify those aspects of biological control that must be understood to enable comprehension of the biological control exerted on the construction of these exquisite biomineral structures. ?? 2008.},

abstract = {There is a paucity of experimental data on calcite precipitation from waters at low ionic strength and low ratios of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca, using controlled and constant precipitation rates. Such data are particularly needed for studies of speleothem geochemistry in relation to palaeoclimates. We carried out a series of experiments using a karst-analogue set-up in a chamber of constant temperature and 100{\%} humidity. A steady flow of NaHCO3 and CaCl2 solutions at PCO2 around 10-3.2 were mixed just before passage through a tube (analogous to a soda-straw stalactite) and allowed to drip onto a surface, analogous to a stalagmite. Growth rates were comparable with linear extension rates of natural speleothems. Analytical spots gave reproducible analyses in later analytical cycles after ablation of surface calcite with Na and Mg contamination. Different crystals from the same experiment tended to show positive covariation of Na and Mg with negative covariation with Sr. This may be due to the presence of growth hillocks with vicinal faces with differential partitioning behaviour. The result for the partition coefficient for Mg (DMg) at 25??C is 0.031 ?? 0.004, which is quantitatively in good agreement with the trends of previous workers. At 15??C, the result is 0.019 ?? 0.003. The temperature dependency is higher than experimental data on seawater-analogue solutions, but lower than a previous estimate based on a comparison of speleothem chemistry with single water analyses. Data for DSr are mainly in the range of 0.057 to 0.078, with a possible weak dependency on growth rate, consistent with previous experimental work. Absolute values are higher than studies in Mg-free saline solutions, which is attributed mainly to salinity effects. Values of DSr are nevertheless somewhat lower than in natural caves, which may relate to crystal growth factors. Mg partition coefficient values should allow robust determination of solution Mg/Ca compositions in enclosed caves, which are at constant temperature on the decadal timescale. The inferred sensitivity of DSr to growth rate factors implies that Sr values should be interpreted more cautiously. Muted changes could relate entirely to growth rate variations, whereas changes of large magnitude imply a control by solution composition. The absence of local (tens of micron scale) antipathetic variations in Sr and Mg in studied natural speleothems, implies that intracrystalline zoning phenomena, if present, are on a finer scale in those natural materials compared with experimental products.

abstract = {Since 1991, significant proportions of Amphistegina populations in the Florida Keys and elsewhere have exhibited stress symptoms that include loss of symbiont color ('bleaching'), anomalous shell breakage and reproductive damage. Previous studies of other taxa have reported elevated Mg/Ca ratios in tests from pollution-stressed foraminiferal populations. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that anomalous shell breakage in stressed Amphistegina gibbosa is the result of loss of control of calcification, resulting in elevated concentrations of Mg that weaken the crystal structure of the test. Analysis of Mg and Ca concentrations in A. gibbosa tests, using an Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer, revealed normal Mg/Ca (2-5 mol{\%}) in all specimens analyzed, including normal specimens collected in 1982 (prior to the onset of the stress event), and both normal and broken specimens collected quarterly from afflicted populations in 1996. Analysis of specimens from the high Mg calcite taxon, Archaias angulatus, revealed Mg/Ca of 10-14 mol{\%}. This study, which presents an ICP-MS procedure that can be used to assess Mg/Ca in individual foraminifera, does not support the hypothesis that shell breakage in stressed Amphistegina results from disruption of calcification at the ionic level. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This study examined whether habitat use by the African anabantid fish Ctenopoma muriei is consistent with predictions relating to two costs of air breathing (surface travel and aerial predation). We predicted that C. muriei would be most abundant in habitats that minimize potential costs of air breathing. We quantified environmental correlates of C. muriei abundance within a series of wetland lagoons in Uganda and found that C. muriei was more abundant in shallow waters of the deepest lagoon, in vegetated habitats, and at a depth 15-30 cm below the surface. These locations may minimize cost of travel to the surface for aerial respiration, while maintaining a reasonable distance from the surface to avoid detection by aerial predators. In addition, we experimentally tested effectiveness of vegetative cover in reducing mortality of C. muriei by aerial predators (pied kingfishers) using enclosures with and without vegetation cover in a swamp pool. We found that the presence of vegetative cover significantly reduced susceptibility of C. muriei to predation by pied kingfishers when dissolved oxygen in the water was low and air-breathing frequency was potentially high.},

abstract = {Calcium carbonate was precipitated from saturated solutions of calcium bicarbonate in the presence of magnesium and organic additives in order to investigate the effect of Mg-incorporation on calcite morphologies. A range of concentrations of Mg and organic additives were investigated, and the structure, composition and morphologies of the crystals were determined using X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. The action of the organic additives in Mg-free solutions was highly specific, producing elongated single calcite crystals. A much wider range of calcite morphologies was observed in the presence of both Mg and organic additives, and a transition from single crystal to aggregates occurred on increasing the Mg concentration. The MgCO3 content of the crystals increased with the solution Mg concentration, but showed little correlation with the organic additive concentration. Single crystals of magnesian calcite containing up to approximately 10{\%} MgCO3 were prepared, and typically exhibited rounded faces and edges. The polycrystalline aggregates had morphologies ranging from dumbbells to spheres and occluded up to about 22{\%} MgCO3. The experiments suggest that Mg2+ ions act in combination with organic additives to affect calcite morphologies by mechanisms such as adsorption on specific crystal faces which inhibits growth, and by altering the calcite nucleation and growth processes. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {As part of the Multi-proxy Approach for the Reconstruction of the Glacial Ocean (MARGO) incentive, published and unpublished temperature reconstructions for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) based on planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios have been synthesised and made available in an online database. Development and applications of Mg/Ca thermometry are described in order to illustrate the current state of the method. Various attempts to calibrate foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios with temperature, including culture, trap and core-top approaches have given very consistent results although differences in methodological techniques can produce offsets between laboratories which need to be assessed and accounted for where possible. Dissolution of foraminiferal calcite at the sea-floor generally causes a lowering of Mg/Ca ratios. This effect requires further study in order to account and potentially correct for it if dissolution has occurred. Mg/Ca thermometry has advantages over other paleotemperature proxies including its use to investigate changes in the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater and the ability to reconstruct changes in the thermal structure of the water column by use of multiple species from different depth and or seasonal habitats. Presently available data are somewhat limited to low latitudes where they give fairly consistent values for the temperature difference between Late Holocene and the LGM (2-3.5°C). Data from higher latitudes are more sparse, and suggest there may be complicating factors when comparing between multi-proxy reconstructions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Marine biodiversity encompasses all levels of complexity of life in the sea, from within species to across ecosystems. At all levels, marine biodiversity has naturally exhibited a general, slow trajectory of increase, punctuated by mass extinctions at the evolutionary scale and by disturbances at the ecological scale. In historical times, a synergy of human threats, including overfishing, global warming, biological introductions, and pollution, has caused a rapid decline in global marine biodiversity, as measured by species extinctions, population depletions, and community homogenization. The consequences of this biodiversity loss include changes in ecosystem function and a reduction in the provision of ecosystem services. Global biodiversity loss will continue and likely accelerate in the future, with potentially more frequent ecological collapses and community-wide shifts. However, the timing and magnitude of these catastrophic events are probably unpredictable},

The variability in Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca within individual tests and chambers was determined by electron microprobe, and samples consisting of variable sample size were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Large compositional heterogeneity was found within individual chambers, and within the test as a whole, of the two species and the presence of regions with up to ∼10 mmol/mol Mg/Ca, especially in G. bulloides. Mean Mg/Ca decreases in successive chambers of G. bulloides (especially the 300–355 $\mu$m fraction) and is accompanied by decreasing variance but is not statistical significant. Sr/Ca is much more homogeneously distributed, with a normal distribution, and shows no differences from chamber to chamber. The variability of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca decreases with increasing sample size, from single to five to twenty tests per sample, approximately as for a normal distribution, with greater variability for G. bulloides than for G. truncatulinoides, equivalent to uncertainties in temperature (n = 20) of 1.1°C and 0.7°C for the two species within the whole of the sediment mixed layer.},

Species include several that are commonly used for estimation of past seawater temperatures (Globigerinoides ruber, G. sacculifer, Neogloboquadrina incompta (synonym of N. pachyderma dex.), N. dutertrei, and G. truncatulinoides). Each of the investigated species displays large variations in Mg/Ca composition within individual tests. However, the pattern of Mg/Ca variation is notably different between symbiont-bearing and symbiont-free species. In symbiotic species, cyclic Mg/Ca compositional banding occurs that is characterized by narrow ({\textless}1–3 $\mu$m), high-Mg/Ca (typically 8–11 mmol/mol) bands, intercalated between broader low Mg/Ca (typically 1–5 mmol/mol) bands. This factor of 2–3 difference equates to an apparent calcification temperature change of 10°C or more. Such temperature changes are considered highly improbable and suggest vital effects significantly modify the incorporation of Mg/Ca into the tests of symbiont-bearing species. These vital effects remain poorly understood and demand further careful evaluation as they may need to be accounted for when making reliable reconstructions of past oceanic temperatures. Symbiont-free species typically have fewer and broader compositional bands that may reflect more closely changes in calcification temperature as these species migrate within a water column.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, the use of multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) has significantly lowered the detection limit of sulfur isotope analyses, albeit typically with decreased precision. Moreover, the presence of isobaric interferences for sulfur prevented accurate analysis of the minor isotopes 33S and 36S. In the present study, we report improved techniques for measuring sulfur isotopes on the MC-ICP-MS Neptune Plus (Thermo Fischer Scientific) using a heated spray chamber coupled to a desolvating membrane (Aridus, Cetac). Working at high mass resolution, we measured ??34S values of natural samples with a typical reproducibility of 0.08-0.15??? (2sd) on 5 to 40nmol sulfur introduced into the instrument. We applied this method to two seawater profiles, using 25??l of sample (700nmol of sulfate). The average ??34SVCDT value is 20.97??0.10??? (2sd, n=25). We show that the amount of sulfate required for an analysis can be decreased to 5nmol. Because the plasma is sustained by Ar, measurement of 36S is impossible at the current mass resolution due to the presence of 36Ar+, but a reproducibility of 0.1-0.3???

abstract = {Microbes are key players in both healthy and degraded coral reefs. A combination of metagenomics, microscopy, culturing, and water chemistry were used to characterize microbial communities on four coral atolls in the Northern Line Islands, central Pacific. Kingman, a small uninhabited atoll which lies most northerly in the chain, had microbial and water chemistry characteristic of an open ocean ecosystem. On this atoll the microbial community was equally divided between autotrophs (mostly Prochlorococcus spp.) and heterotrophs. In contrast, Kiritimati, a large and populated ( approximately 5500 people) atoll, which is most southerly in the chain, had microbial and water chemistry characteristic of a near-shore environment. On Kiritimati, there were 10 times more microbial cells and virus-like particles in the water column and these microbes were dominated by heterotrophs, including a large percentage of potential pathogens. Culturable Vibrios were common only on Kiritimati. The benthic community on Kiritimati had the highest prevalence of coral disease and lowest coral cover. The middle atolls, Palmyra and Tabuaeran, had intermediate densities of microbes and viruses and higher percentages of autotrophic microbes than either Kingman or Kiritimati. The differences in microbial communities across atolls could reflect variation in 1) oceaonographic and/or hydrographic conditions or 2) human impacts associated with land-use and fishing. The fact that historically Kingman and Kiritimati did not differ strongly in their fish or benthic communities (both had large numbers of sharks and high coral cover) suggest an anthropogenic component in the differences in the microbial communities. Kingman is one of the world's most pristine coral reefs, and this dataset should serve as a baseline for future studies of coral reef microbes. Obtaining the microbial data set, from atolls is particularly important given the association of microbes in the ongoing degradation of coral reef ecosystems worldwide.},

The changes in carbon and nutrient fluxes between different microbial pools (from snow to ice, cryoconite holes and glacial forefronts) revealed that snow and ice algae dominate the net primary production at the onset of melting, and that they have the potential to support the cryoconite hole communities as carbon and nutrient sources. A large proportion of algal cells is retained on the glacial surface and temporal and spatial changes in pigmentation contribute to the darkening of the snow and ice surfaces. This implies that the fast, melt-induced algal growth has a high albedo reduction potential, and this may lead to a positive feedback speeding up melting processes.},

Coprecipitation displays a log-linear relationship at low Na concentrations and converges toward NaHCO3 saturation at higher concentrations. Coprecipitation is independent of Mg in the carbonate structure which suggests similar Na concentrations in calcites and dolomites. Na coprecipitation increases greatly in the presence of aqueous citrate. Organic substances present in invertebrate body fluids may account for high Na concentrations in Recent calcites relative to older diagenetic carbonates. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

However, it remains unknown how peptides interact with inorganic materials or how specific those interactions are. We, therefore, assessed the target specificities of the peptide aptamer TBP-1 (RKLPDAPGMHTW) by monitoring its ability to bind 10 different metals. We found that phages displaying TBP-1 bound to Ti, Si, and Ag surfaces but not to Au, Cr, Pt, Sn, Zn, Cu, or Fe. As previously seen with Ti, binding to Si and Ag was diminished by R1A, P4A, or D5A mutation, suggesting that the same molecular mechanism underlies TBP-1 binding to all three materials. We also observed that a synthetic TBP-1 peptide mediated mineralization of both silica and Ag. It, thus, appears that although the overall chemical characteristics of Ti, Si, and Ag surfaces are dissimilar, they share a common subnanometric structure that is recognized by TBP-1.},

However, they are not equivalent to thermodynamic constants and generally represent phenomenological measurements under a given set of conditions. In recent years a number of factors, which were not previously considered of importance, have been found to exert major influences on the relation between the compositions of solutions and the calcites which precipitate from them. In this paper, we examine the complexities associated with the coprecipitation of metals in calcite using the behavior of Sr and Mg, which have received the most detailed study, as examples. Given the growing number of parameters which have been found to exert major influences on partition coefficients, and the failure of experimentally determined partition coefficients to predict even the composition of modern marine cements, we recommend that they be applied to natural systems with considerable caution. ?? 1990.},

abstract = {We show that ants can reconnoitre their surroundings and in effect plan for the future. Temnothorax albipennis colonies use a sophisticated strategy to select a new nest when the need arises. Initially, we presented colonies with a new nest of lower quality than their current one that they could explore for one week without a need to emigrate. We then introduced a second identical low quality new nest and destroyed their old nest so that they had to emigrate. Colonies showed a highly significant preference for the (low quality) novel new nest over the identical but familiar one. In otherwise identical experiments, colonies showed no such discrimination when the choice was between a familiar and an unfamiliar high-quality nest. When, however, either all possible pheromone marks were removed, or landmarks were re-orientated, just before the emigration, the ants chose between identical low-quality new nests at random. These results demonstrate for the first time that ants are capable of assessing and retaining information about the quality of potential new nest sites, probably by using both pheromones and landmark cues, even though this information may only be of strategic value to the colony in the future. They seem capable, therefore, of latent learning and, more explicitly, learning what not to do.},

Spectral responses of three coral skeletons show that the sulfated form is extremely dominant in coral aragonite, and practically exclusive within both centres of calcification and the surrounding fibrous tissues of coral septa. Mapping of S-sulfate concentrations in centres and fibres gives us direct evidence of high concentration of organic sulfate in centres of calcification. Additionally, a banding pattern of S-sulfate is visible in fibrous part of the coral septa, evidencing a biochemical zonation that corresponds to the step-by-step growth of fibres. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Resistance to virus infections in higher vertebrates is mediated in part through catalysis of RNA decay by the, interferon-regulated 2-5A system. A functional 2-5A system requires two enzymes, a 2-5A synthetase that produces 5'-phosphorylated, 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) in response to double-stranded RNA, and the 2-5A-dependent RNase L. We have coexpressed these human enzymes in transgenic tobacco plants by using a single plasmid containing the cDNAs for both human RNase L and a low molecular weight form of human 2-5A synthetase under control of different, constitutive promoters. Expression of the human cDNAs in the transgenic plants was demonstrated from Northern blots, by specific enzyme assays, and by immunodetection (for RNase L). Infection of leaves, detached or in planta, of the coexpressing transgenic plants by tobacco mosaic virus, alfalfa [correction of alfafa] mosaic virus, or tobacco etch virus resulted in necrotic lesions. In contrast, leaves expressing 2-5A synthetase or RNase L alone and leaves containing the plasmid vector alone produced typical systemic infections. While alfalfa mosaic virus produced lesions only in the inoculated leaves regardless of the concentration of virus in the inoculum, high, but not low, levels of tobacco etch virus inoculum resulted in escape of virus to uninoculated leaves. Nevertheless, there was a substantial reduction of tobacco etch virus yield as measured by ELISA assay in the coexpressing transgenic plants. These results indicate that expression of a mammalian 2-5A system in plants provides resistance to virus infections.},

In organic matter within planktonic foraminifera shells in Caribbean Sea sediments, we found that the 15N/14N ratio from the last ice age is higher than that from the current interglacial, indicating a higher nitrate 15N/14N ratio in the Caribbean thermocline. This change and other species-specific differences are best explained by less N fixation in the Atlantic during the last ice age. The fixation decrease was most likely a response to a known ice age reduction in ocean N loss, and it would have worked to balance the ocean N budget and to curb ice age-interglacial change in the N inventory.},

By deconvolving XRD peak (104) from Globorotalia tumida (surface sediments, Sierra Leone Rise depth transect), we show that the full width at midheight does not depend only upon crystallinity, but reflects also the chemical and structural heterogeneity of foraminifera tests, which results in closely spaced, individual (104) diffraction peaks corresponding to phases with slightly different Mg contents. G. tumida contains two calcite phases: a well crystallized, Mg-poor calcite and a poorly crystallized, Mg-richer calcite. Increasing dissolution results in the preferential removal of the Mg-richer calcite and the improvement of its crystallinity, whereas the Mg-poor calcite does not seem to be affected by dissolution between 2750 m and 4950 m of water depth on Sierra Leone Rise.},

An ectomycor- rhizal fungus was grown in symbiosis with a tree seedling so that individual hyphae expanded across the surface of a biotite fl ake over a period of three months. Ultramicroscopic and spectroscopic analysis of the fungus-biotite interfaces revealed intimate fungal- mineral attachment, biomechanical forcing, altered interlayer spac- ings, substantial depletion of potassium ({\~{}}50 nm depth), oxidation of the biotite Fe(II), and the formation of vermiculite and clusters of Fe(III) oxides. Our study demonstrates the biomechanical-chemical alteration interplay at the fungus-biotite interface at the nanometer scale. Specifi cally, the weathering process is initiated by physical dis- tortion of the lattice structure of biotite within 1 µm of the attached fungal hypha. Only subsequently does the distorted volume become chemically altered through dissolution and oxidation reactions that lead to mineral neoformation.},

abstract = {Abstract Fish population variability and fisheries activities are closely linked to weather and climate dynamics. While weather at sea directly affects fishing, environmental variability determines the distribution, migration, and abundance of fish. Fishery science grew up during the last century by integrating knowledge from oceanography, fish biology, marine ecology, and fish population dynamics, largely focused on the great Northern Hemisphere fisheries. During this period, understanding and explaining interannual fish recruitment variability became a major focus for fisheries oceanographers. Yet, the close link between climate and fisheries is best illustrated by the effect of “unexpected” events—that is, nonseasonal, and sometimes catastrophic—on fish exploitation, such as those associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The observation that fish populations fluctuate at decadal time scales and show patterns of synchrony while being geographically separated drew attention to oceanograph...},

abstract = {We investigated the effect of the calcium concentration in seawater and thereby the calcite saturation state ($\Omega$) on the magnesium and strontium incorporation into benthic foraminiferal calcite under laboratory conditions. For this purpose individuals of the shallow-water species Heterostegina depressa (precipitating high-Mg calcite, symbiont-bearing) and Ammonia tepida (low-Mg calcite, symbiont-barren) were cultured in media under a range of [Ca2+], but similar Mg/Ca ratios. Trace element/Ca ratios of newly formed calcite were analysed with Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and normalized to the seawater elemental composition using the equation DTE=(TE/Cacalcite)/(TE/Caseawater). The culturing study shows that DMg of A. tepida significantly decreases with increasing $\Omega$ at a gradient of −4.3×10−5 per $\Omega$ unit. The DSr value of A. tepida does not change with $\Omega$, suggesting that fossil Sr/Ca in this species may be a potential tool to reconstruct past variations in seawater Sr/Ca. Conversely, DMg of H. depressa shows only a minor decrease with increasing $\Omega$, while DSr increases considerably with $\Omega$ at a gradient of 0.009 per $\Omega$ unit. The different responses to seawater chemistry of the two species may be explained by a difference in the calcification pathway that is, at the same time, responsible for the variation in the total Mg incorporation between the two species. Since the Mg/Ca ratio in H. depressa is 50–100 times higher than that of A. tepida, it is suggested that the latter exhibits a mechanism that decreases the Mg/Ca ratio of the calcification fluid, while the high-Mg calcite forming species may not have this physiological tool. If the dependency of Mg incorporation on seawater [Ca2+] is also valid for deep-sea benthic foraminifera typically used for paleostudies, the higher Ca concentrations in the past may potentially bias temperature reconstructions to a considerable degree. For instance, 25 Myr ago Mg/Ca ratios in A. tepida would have been 0.2 mmol/mol lower than today, due to the 1.5 times higher [Ca2+] of seawater, which in turn would lead to a temperature underestimation of more than 2 °C.},

abstract = {Eutrophication of aquatic environments is a major environmental problem in large parts of the world. In Europe, EU legislation (the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive), international conventions (OSPAR, HELCOM) and national environmental objectives emphasize the need to reduce the input of plant nutrients to freshwater and marine environments. A widely used method to achieve this is to let water pass through a constructed or restored wetland (CW). However, the large variation in measured nutrient removal rates in such wetlands calls for a systematic review. The objective of this review is to quantify nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates in constructed or restored wetlands and relate them to wetland characteristics, loading characteristics, and climate factors. Wetlands are created to treat water from a number of different sources. Sources that will be considered in this review include agricultural runoff and urban storm water run-off, as well as aquaculture wastewater and outlets from domestic wastewater treatment plants, with particular attention to the situation in Sweden. Although the performance of wetlands in temperate and boreal regions is most relevant to the Swedish stakeholders a wider range of climatic conditions will be considered in order to make a thorough evaluation of climatic factors.},

abstract = {Rare earth elements (REE), Sr, Ba, Fe, Mg, Ca, Na, and K concentrations in three kinds of living foraminiferal tests collected from Iriomote Island, Japan were measured in order to obtain some qualitative aspects of trace element behavior during biogenic CaCO3 formation. The obtained results were examined using the sample/seawater concentration ratios, which can be considered as a measure of total effect of element incorporation into biogenic CaCO3 in marine environ- ments. On a sample/seawater concentration ratio vs. ionic radius diagram, the foraminifera/seawater ratios of trivalent REEs and divalent Mg, Ca and Sr fall on their respective curves having peaks near the Ca ionic radius. This is consistent with the most widely accepted theory that solid/liquid partition coefficients are largely controlled by the sizes of the host site in the crystal and the substituting cation, such that a cation that has the most suitable size for the site can enter the crystal most easily. On the other hand, the foraminifera/seawater ratios of Fe and Ba show higher values than those expected from the crystal structure control model, which might be caused by insoluble precipitates such as Fe-hydroxides and barite. It is interesting that the concentrations of REEs in foraminifera are correlated with those of Fe, which suggests coprecipitation of REE with Fe-hydroxide. Such coprecipitation of REE might have occurred in seawater, followed by uptake of Fe-hydroxides by foraminiferal food micro-organisms. After digestion of such food, the dissolved REEs in intracellular fluid might have fractionated as CaCO3 crystallization proceeds, and the combined crystal structure and ionic radius effect becomes conspicuous forming a peak on the foraminifera/seawater ratio vs. ionic radius diagram.},

The shells were examined for their calcium isotope compositions (??44/40Ca) and strontium to calcium ratios (Sr/Ca) using Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Although the total variation in ??44/40Ca (???0.3???) in the studied species is on the same order as the external reproducibility, the data set reveals some apparent trends that are controlled by more than one environmental parameter. There is a well-defined inverse linear relationship between ??44/40Ca and Sr/Ca in all experiments, suggesting similar controls on these proxies in foraminiferal calcite independent of species. Analogous to recent results from inorganically precipitated calcite, we suggest that Ca isotope fractionation and Sr partitioning in planktic foraminifera are mainly controlled by precipitation kinetics. This postulation provides us with a unique tool to calculate precipitation rates and draws support from the observation that Sr/Ca ratios are positively correlated with average growth rates. At 25??C water temperature, precipitation rates in G. siphonifera and G. ruber are calculated to be on the order of 2000 and 3000??mol/m2/h, respectively. The lower ??44/40Ca observed at ???29??C in both species is consistent with increased precipitation rates at high water temperatures. Salinity response of ??44/40Ca (and Sr/Ca) in G. siphonifera implies that this species has the highest precipitation rates at the salinity of its natural habitat, whereas increasing salinities appear to trigger higher precipitation rates in G. ruber. Isotope effects that cannot be explained by precipitation rate in planktic foraminifera can be explained by a biological control, related to a vacuolar pathway for supply of ions during biomineralization and a pH regulation mechanism in these vacuoles. In case of an additional pathway via cross-membrane transport, supplying light Ca for calcification, the ??44/40Ca of the reservoir is constrained as -0.2??? relative to seawater. Using a Rayleigh distillation model, we calculate that calcification occurs in a semi-open system, where less than half of the Ca supplied by vacuolization is utilized for calcite precipitation. Our findings are relevant for interpreting paleo-proxy data on ??44/40Ca and Sr/Ca in foraminifera as well as understanding their biomineralization processes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {An ecosystem model embedded in a one-dimensional physical model is used to study the stoichiometry of carbon and nitrogen cycling at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series site. The model successfully provides a budget for the processes contributing to the drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) that is observed in surface waters in the absence of detectable nitrate throughout much of the summer. The modeled drawdown is initially driven by export fueled by in situ N and accumulation of dissolved organic carbon, with continued DIC consumption after nutrient exhaustion resulting largely from nitrogen fixation and outgassing of CO2 to the atmosphere. The modeled export flux of organic C at 300 m is dominated by particles (81{\%}), with a nevertheless significant fraction (19{\%}) due to dissolved organic matter. The predicted combined C/N of particulate and dissolved export increases from 10.8 at 70m to 14.3 at 300m, because of preferential remineralization of N. In theory, at least as a first approximation, the ratio of net consumption of DIC and nutrients in the euphotic zone is equivalent to this C/N of export. However, the C/N of consumption during DIC drawdown averaged 23.5 ({\textgreater}10.8), indicating that this assumption is not always valid and C/N ratios of nutrient consumption cannot reliably be used to estimate the export ratio, which is difficult to measure directly. The work highlights the complex interplay between the cycling of C and N the upper ocean and the resultant export flux. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This work is an assessment of the effects of seawater salinity and temperature on the incorporation of fluoride into calcitic shells of planktonic foraminifera and of the subsequent modification of shell chemistry by postdepositional dissolution. A strong correlation between the fluoride content of most planktonic species and their calcification depth was observed; deeper-calcifying foraminifera have lower fluoride content and heavier 18O composition, perhaps suggesting a temperature control on the partition coefficient. However, species deviations from this general trend and the absence of correlation between fluoride and sea-surface temperature within an individual species suggest that the coprecipitation of fluoride in foraminiferal calcite is more strongly controlled by biological processes rather than by simple chemical relationships. Foraminiferal fluoride shows weak or no correlation with sea-surface salinity. Core-top planktonic foraminifera from the eastern equatorial Atlantic (Sierra Leone Rise) show a substantial decrease of fluoride and, to a lesser extent, Mg content with increasing water depth (2931-5104 m). These decreasing trends with depth are attributed to selective dissolution, i.e., removal of the more dissolution-susceptible fraction with a different chemical composition than the residual, a process which previously has been suggested to account for variations in the isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifera. These findings indicate that foraminiferal fluoride cannot serve as a reliable tracer of oceanic paleo-temperature or salinity. It is possible, however, that fluoride may be useful for the study of dissolution in deep-sea sediments. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios were determined on a single species of planktonic foraminiferan, Globigerinoides ruber (white), collected from the Gulf of Eilat and cultured in seawater at five different salinities (32 to 44), five temperatures (18 to 30 °C) and four pH values (7.9 to 8.4). The Mg/Ca-temperature calibration of cultured G. ruber (with an exponential slope of 8 ± 3{\%}/°C) agrees well with previously published calibrations from core-tops and sediment traps. However, the dependence of Mg/Ca on salinity (with an exponential slope of 5 ± 3{\%}/psu) is also significant and should be included in the calibration equation. With this purpose, we calculated a calibration equation for G. ruber dependent on both temperature and salinity within the 95{\%} confidence limits:Mg / Ca (mmol/mol) = e x p [0.06 (± 0.02) * S (psu) + 0.08 (± 0.02) * T (° C) 2.8 (± 1.0)], R2 = 0.95 The influence of pH on Mg/Ca ratios is negligible at ambient seawater pH (8.1 to 8.3). However, we observe a dominating pH control on shell Mg/Ca when the pH of seawater is lower than 8.0. Sr/Ca in G. ruber shows a significant positive correlation with average growth rate. Presumably, part of the variability in shell Sr/Ca in the geological record is linked to changes in growth rates of foraminifera as a response to changing environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Parallel stable isotope (d18Occ) and Mg/Ca measurements performed in three planktonic foraminifer species provide multiple perspectives on past temperature change and thus allow published calibrations for these geochemical proxies to be tested against each other. The comparison of “simultaneous” temperature records, as recorded by both the d18Occ and Mg/Ca signature of each species, reveals very clearly the nonpassive character of foraminifera as proxy carriers and allows the systematic temperature response of d18Occ and Mg/Ca in different foraminifer species to be explored. On the basis of their Mg/Ca signatures, Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (right), Globigerina bulloides, and Globigerinoides ruber (white) are each found to exhibit a specific and narrow range of temperature variability; however, the interspecies offsets in “optimum” temperature habitat that are suggested in this way are not expressed by similarly scaled d18Occ offsets. Hence it is demonstrated that the temperature modes/variations that are recorded by each species cannot be calibrated to Mg/Ca and d18Occ variations via a single pair of calibrations for all three species: species-specific d18Occ and/or Mg/Ca temperature calibrations are required. On the basis of the average d18Occ and Mg/Ca offsets observed between the three species, it appears that many of the temperature calibrations that are currently proposed for both of these proxies are inconsistent. The data presented here cannot provide species-specific Mg/Ca and d18Occ temperature calibrations; however, they do provide a simple method for testing our calibrations in application and clearly indicate that further calibration work using paired Mg/Ca and d18Occ is required before the full potential of these proxies may be realized.},

abstract = {At the resolution Limits of traditional geochemical techniques, there is Little evidence to challenge the common assumptions that, under the Earth's ambient surface conditions, dry calcite is static and that the bulk mineral behaves as a dosed system. Solid-state diffusion has been recognized at elevated temperatures(1-3), but it has always been assumed that diffusion in carbonate minerals is negligible under standard conditions(4,5). There is, however some evidence to the contrary, More than 30 years ago, the Ca-45 diffusion coefficient was estimated to be similar to 8 x 10(-20) cm(2) (ref. 6) and, more recently, we have demonstrated movement of adsorbed Cd2+ and Zn2+ into bulk calcite at rates of tens of nanometres over weeks to months (refs 7, 8). Here we present evidence that monovalent ions, Na+, K+ and Cl-, originating from fluid inclusions, accumulate in crystallites on the surface of calcite. This process is spontaneous at the Earth's surface conditions, in air. The results show that calcite under standard conditions does not always behave as a dosed system, which is a critical assumption in the use of isotope ratios, trace-element distribution and fluid-inclusion composition for interpretations of palaeoclimate, geochronology or petrogenesis. Moreover, calcite's uptake capacity for contaminants in environmental systems is probably higher than current models predict, because surface sites are constantly renewed by ionic mobility.},

abstract = {The carbon isotopic composition of marine phytoplankton varies significantly with growth conditions. Aqueous CO2 concentration [CO2] and algal growth rate (µ) have been suggested to be important factors determining isotope fractionation ($\epsilon$p). Here we examine $\epsilon$p of the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi in relation to CO2 concentration and light conditions in dilute batch cultures. Cells were incubated at different irradiance cycles, photon flux densities (PFDs), and [CO2]. Isotope fractionation varied between 6.7 and 12.3‰ under 16 : 8 h light : dark cycle (L :D) and between 14.7 and 17.8‰ at continuous light. $\epsilon$p was largely independent of ambient [CO2], varying generally by less than 2‰ over a range of [CO2] from 5 to 34 mmol L−1. Instantaneous carbon-specific growth rates (µC) and PFDs, ranging from 15 to 150 mmol m−2 s−1, positively correlated with $\epsilon$p. This result is inconsistent with theoretical considerations and experimental results obtained under constant light conditions, suggesting an inverse relationship between $\epsilon$p and µ. In the present study the effect of PFDs on $\epsilon$p was stronger than that of mand thus resulted in a positive relationship between µ and $\epsilon$p. In addition, the L:D cycle of 16 : 8 h resulted in significantly lower $\epsilon$p values compared to continuous light. Since the observed offset of about 8‰ could not be related to daylength dependent changes in µC, this implies a direct influence of the irradiance cycle on $\epsilon$p. These findings are best explained by invoking active carbon uptake in E. huxleyi. If representative for the natural environment, these results complicate the interpretation of carbon isotope data in geochemical and paleoceanographic applications.},

A doubling of CO2 from 380 ppmv to 760 ppmv (the 2 × CO2 scenario) increases the seawater acidity approximately 0.19 pH units across the same range of seawater temperature. In the latter case, the predicted increase in acidity results in a pH within the water-quality limits for seawater of 6.5 and 8.5 and a change in pH less than 0.20 pH units. This paper's results concerning average seawater salinity and acidity show that, on a global scale and over the time scales considered (hundreds of years), there would not be accentuated changes in either seawater salinity or acidity from the observed or hypothesized rises in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.},

abstract = {With the advent of computationally fast “intermediate complexity” models of Earth's climate and carbon cycle the marine record can be interpreted much more directly than before. Specifically, the mechanistic simulation of deep-sea sediment cores provides an important step in bridging the model-data divide. Here I use this methodology to help interpret the excursion in carbonate compensation depth (CCD) during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum that is recorded in cores recovered from Walvis Ridge in the South Atlantic. By explicitly simulating the expected geological record of a massive CO2 release in an Earth system model I show how reduction in the intensity of subsurface mixing of the sediment by benthic animals substantially magnifies the recorded shoaling of the CCD. Conversely, to quantify correctly the carbon release consistent with the observed CCD changes, one must account for any bioturbational changes. A reduction in sediment mixing intensity also appears to be important to reproducing the sharpness of the contact between carbonate-rich late Paleocene sediments and the overlying early Eocene clay layer at Walvis Ridge. Assuming a relatively rapid (approximately 1 ka duration) CO2 release further helps to account for some of the paleoceanographic observations. Finally, interbasin differences in bioturbational regime help resolve some of the observed disparity in carbonate preservation between Walvis Ridge and sites outside of the Atlantic, although changes in ocean ventilation and circulation are also likely to play a critical role in this.},

The results f¾om a Monte Carlo optical model are closely compared to data from the CD60 cruise for a coccolithophore bloom south of Iceland in 1991 [Holligan ct al., 1993], and the model is then used to extrapolate from the observational data to predict diverse optical properties that were not measured. Model perfbrmance was also tested by comparison of results with those from other, more established optical models. The model results demonstrate clearly that coccoliths radiance), (2) brighter, more intensely heated water in the top few meters, and (3) darker, less intensely heated water deeper down.

abstract = {Organisms can exert a remarkable degree oi control over crystal growth. One way of achieving this is by the adsorption of specialized macromolecules on specific planes of the growing crystals. With continued growth of the crystal, the macromolecules are incorporated inside the crystal bulk. Their presence does not change the crystal structure, but creates discontinuities in the perfect lattice. Here we study in detail three unusual cases of reduction in symmetry at the level of crystal domain shapes, induced by this controlled intercalation. We examined sponge spicules, which are single crystals of Mg-bearing calcite, They were specifically chosen for this study, because their morphologies do not reflect the hexagonal symmetry of calcite. Their crystal textures (coherence lengths and angular spreads) were characterized by high-resolution Xray diffraction with well-collimated synchrotron radiation. The results are compared to analogous studies of synthetic calcite and Mg-bearing calcite. In all the selected spicules reduction in symmetry is observed in the coherence lengths among symmetry-related crystallographic directions. The reconstructed shapes of the domains of perfect structure closely match the specific spicule morphologies. The synthetic crystals show no such reduction in symmetry. Although the manner by which such exquisite control is achieved is not known, we envisage it involving a combination of oriented nucleation with either physical or stereochemically driven adsorption.},

abstract = {Four surveys of the Huelva Estuary in southwest Spain and its sources, the Tinto and the Odiel Rivers, were carried out between 1996 and 1998. The surveys investigated the impact of metalliferous mining of sulfide-rich ores in the catchment area on metal speciation, metal concentrations in a macrophyte, and phytoplankton diversity and abundance. Chemical speciation measurements in the lower Tinto Estuary showed that metals were predominantly electrochemically labile ({\textgreater} 99{\%} of total dissolved Cu, Co, and Ni at 10 microM Cu, 424 nM Co, and 500 nM Ni, S = 28). Concentrations of Cu complexing ligands and free cupric ions [Cu2+] in the Gulf of C{\'{a}}diz ranged between 5.3 and 38 nM and 0.2-7.9 pM, respectively, with conditional stability constants of the ligands of log K'(CuL) = 11.7-12.6. At enhanced dissolved Cu concentrations in the lower Huelva Estuary, Cu complexing ligands were saturated with Cu, resulting in nanomolar [Cu2+], which increased upstream.

A low biodiversity was observed in the Huelva system (Shannon-Wiener indices (H) typically {\textless} 0.2). Nevertheless, the maximum biomass was observed in the lower Tinto Estuary, which showed high labile metal and nutrient concentrations and a low biodiversity (H {\textless} 0.02), thereby suggesting adaptation through evolutionary processes of the phytoplankton community to the harsh conditions.},

abstract = {About 850,000 years ago, the period of the glacial cycles changed from 41,000 to 100,000 years. This mid-Pleistocene climate transition has been attributed to global cooling, possibly caused by a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. However, evidence for such cooling is currently restricted to the cool upwelling regions in the eastern equatorial oceans, although the tropical warm pools on the western side of the ocean basins are particularly sensitive to changes in radiative forcing. Here we present high-resolution records of sea surface temperatures spanning the past 1.75 million years, obtained from oxygen isotopes and Mg/Ca ratios in planktonic foraminifera from the western Pacific warm pool. In contrast with the eastern equatorial regions, sea surface temperatures in the western Pacific warm pool are relatively stable throughout the Pleistocene epoch, implying little long-term change in the tropical net radiation budget. Our results challenge the hypothesis of a gradual decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations as a dominant trigger of the longer glacial cycles since 850,000 years ago. Instead, we infer that the temperature contrast across the equatorial Pacific Ocean increased, which might have had a significant influence on the mid-Pleistocene climate transition.},

abstract = {1. Marine predators can be adversely affected by human activities in several potentially interacting ways. Industrial fisheries can affect predator populations adversely through competition for shared prey, and marine environmental change has also been implicated in population declines. In the North Sea, black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla have declined by {\textgreater} 50{\%} since 1990, a period during which a lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus fishery was active and profound oceanographic changes occurred. We studied the role of fisheries and oceanography in kittiwake declines on the Isle of May, south-east Scotland, where sandeels are the main prey. 2. Demographic data were collected from 1986 to 2002. We examined changes over time and correlations between population parameters, the local sandeel fishery and environmental factors, and incorporated the results in a deterministic and a stochastic matrix population model. 3. Breeding success and adult survival were low when the sandeel fishery was active (1991-98) and were also negatively correlated with winter sea temperature, with a 1-year lag for breeding success. Modelling showed that the observed changes in population parameters could explain the change in population growth rate from +8{\%} year(-1) in the late 1980s to -11{\%} year(-1) in the late 1990s. An observed improvement in breeding success from 2000 onwards has been insufficient to arrest the population decline. To stabilize the population, breeding success must increase to unprecedented levels or survival needs to increase substantially. Stochastic modelling indicated that the population was unlikely to increase if the fishery was active or sea temperature increased, and that the population was almost certain to decrease if both occurred. 4. Sandeel recruitment is reduced in warm winters, and we propose that this explains the temperature effects on kittiwake survival and breeding success. The fishery also had a strong effect on demographic performance, although the exact mechanism is unclear as kittiwakes and fishermen target different sandeel age groups. 5. Synthesis and applications. Poor breeding success of kittiwakes was associated with warm winters and the presence of a local sandeel fishery. Reversing the trend towards warmer winters may be impossible and, at best, would be a very slow process. Therefore, to safeguard kittiwake populations we recommend that the current closure of the commercial sandeel fishery remain in place indefinitely. This study shows that adequate monitoring of the effect of a fishery or of environmental change on seabird populations needs to include survival as well as breeding success},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

abstract = {Dissolved boron in seawater occurs mainly in the form of boric acid (B(OH)3) and borate (B(OH)-4). While the equilibrium properties of the dissociation of boric acid have been studied in detail, very little work has focused on the kinetics of the boric acid-borate equilibrium in seawater. Here, we present a theoretical study of the relaxation of the seawater borate-carbonate system towards equilibrium using the experimental data of Mallo et al. [Nouv. J. Chim. 8 (1984) 373] and Waton et al. [J. Phys. Chem. 88 (1984) 3301]. The reaction rate constants are two to four orders of magnitude smaller than typical rate constants of diffusion-controlled reactions of other acid-base equilibria. This is presumably due to the substantial structural change that is involved in the conversion from planar B(OH)3 to tetrahedral B(OH)4. The time required to establish the boric acid-borate equilibrium in seawater is calculated to be ∼ 95$\mu$s at temperature T = 25°C and salinity S = 35. Considering stable boron isotopes 11B and 10B, the isotopic equilibration time is ∼ 125 $\mu$s. As a result, kinetic isotope effects during coprecipitation of boron in calcium carbonate are unlikely and therefore do not affect the use of stable boron isotopes as a paleo-pH recorder. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The partitioning of rare earth elements (REEs) in calcite overgrowths precipitated from sea-water solutions under steady-state conditions was investigated experimentally using a constant addition technique. The composition of the overgrowths and their parent solutions was determined by chelation and gradient ion chromatography (CGIC) and described using nonthermodynamic homogeneous partition coefficients. REEs are strongly partitioned into calcite and substitute for Ca2+. Their partition coefficients decrease systematically with atomic number, from ???103.6 for La3+ to ???101.9 for Yb3+ when their concentrations in solution are maintained at 70 nM. Under our experimental conditions, the partition coefficient of individual REEs was not affected by the calcite precipitation rate or [CO32-] of the solutions. The partitioning of light REEs, however, was influenced by variations of their absolute solution concentrations. The partitioning behaviour of REEs is correlated to the solubility of their respective carbonate minerals. REE speciation in solution, adsorption on the surface of calcite, and subsequent reactions (e.g., dehydration) affect the partitioning process. Although the dissolved REE concentrations used in these experiments are exceptionally high for natural marine environments, the compatibility of our results with those obtained from field studies suggests that the partition coefficients derived from this study may have some potential for the interpretation of environmental, diagenetic, and paleoceanographic data. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Three uppermost Cretaceous through basal Paleocene stratigraphic sequences are examined for planktic foraminiferal assemblage stability and temporal succession patterns. These sequences are at mid-latitude South Atlantic DSDP Site 528, then-equatorial Pacific DSDP Site 577 and the Tethyan shelf Ben Gurion section of the Negev, Israel. In order to better estimate biogeographic patterns and habitat preferences, the results of these analyses are compared to previous Cretaceous biogeographic studies and to previous analyses of Cretaceous-Tertiary (K/T) boundary shelf and epicontinental sections. Results indicate that immediately following the K/T boundary, the examined epicontinental and open-ocean sites were exploited primarily by previously epicontinental planktic foraminiferal assemblages. This pattern of K/T boundary assemblage dominance suggests the geologically instantaneous break-down of Late Cretaceous epicontinental and open-ocean biogeographic provincialization. This shift in open-ocean foraminiferal assemblages is not consistent with models of non-selective K/T boundary extinctions, but is consistent with models of extinction resistence and offshore expansion of near-shore taxa. The re-establishment of stable biogeographic differences between open-ocean and epicontinental planktic foraminiferal assemblages occurs by the basalParvularugoglobigerina eugubina Zone. At open-ocean sites 528 and 577 and the outer-shelf Ben Gurion section, PO andP. eugubina Zone faunal records are marked by a pronounced alternation between Paleocene biserial- and non-biserial-dominated assemblages. This alternation appears strongly damped at shelf and epicontinental sections previously examined. The first appearance and peak magnitude of abundant earliest Paleocene trochospiral forms (Parvularugoglobigerina, Eoglobigerina, Morozovella, Globoconusa) also vary from site to site and may depend closely on levels of primary carbonate productivity. ?? 1991 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.},

Adding insult to injury, it is exposed to the frequently corrosive environment of the oral cavity. While its hierarchical structure is unrivaled in its mechanical resilience, heterogeneity in the distribution of magnesium ions and the presence of Mg-substituted amorphous calcium phosphate (Mg-ACP) as an intergranular phase have recently been shown to increase the susceptibility of mouse enamel to acid attack. Herein we investigate the distribution of two important constituents of enamel, residual organic matter and inorganic carbonate. We find that organics, carbonate, and possibly water show distinct distribution patterns in the mouse enamel crystallites, at simple grain boundaries, and in the amorphous interphase at multiple grain boundaries. This has implications for the resistance to acid corrosion, mechanical properties, and the mechanism by which enamel crystals grow during amelogenesis.},

abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that Sr/Ca ratios of coccolithophores may be affected by productivity. Here we compile published Sr/Ca data from bulk carbonate, fine fraction sediment, and planktonic foraminiferal Sr/Ca records that span the past 60 Myr and attempt to place these records into a paleoceanographic framework. We account for changes in seawater Sr/Ca ratios using the curve of Lear et al. [2003] and discuss our observations with respect to changes in the partitioning coefficient of Sr through time. We discuss limitations associated with postburial processes, temporal changes in the coccolith/planktonic foraminiferal rain ratio, and the coccolith species composition of the sediment. Despite these caveats, we are able to show that in the bulk and fine fraction carbonate records there are two broad periods of enhanced partitioning of Sr relative to today, the Oligocene, and the middle to late Miocene/early Pliocene. Because these are two intervals for which we can cite evidence for a relatively productive ocean on the regional or global scale, we believe that the Sr/Ca ratios of bulk carbonate can be explained, at least in part, by the effects of oceanic nutrient levels on Sr uptake during calcification of coccoliths, which make up the vast majority of these sediments. Within the limits of the inferred seawater Sr/Ca record the results of this study contribute a geologic perspective to recent laboratory and field studies that have raised the possibility that Sr incorporation into biogenic calcite is controlled by biogeochemical processes.},

In both box II and box II, methylation interference experiments demonstrate that two adjacent G residues are critical for GT-binding. Single Gs present in boxes III and III are also important. Since GT-1 is present in nuclear extracts from leaves of light-grown and dark-adapted pea plants, its regulatory role does not depend on de novo synthesis.

LA-ICP-MS results on uncleaned tests indicate the presence of Mn-Mg-rich contaminant phases at the inner surfaces of the foraminiferal shells ( which have Mn/Ca ratios up to 400 mmol mol(-1) and Mg/Ca ratios up to 50 mmol mol(-1)). We have rigorously assessed the ability of different cleaning protocols to remove these contaminant phases and have obtained satisfactory results only when a reductive step is included. The analysis of cleaning residuals collected after each of the different cleaning steps applied reveals that high Mn values are associated with at least two different contaminant phases, of which only one is linked to high Mg values. XRD analysis further reveals that the Mn-Mg-rich phase is the Ca-Mn-Mg carbonate kutnahorite (Ca(Mn, Mg)(CO3)(2)). Our results demonstrate that the presence of kutnahorite-like minerals can bias Mg/Ca ratios toward higher values ( by 7 - 36{\%}) and lead to significant overestimation of past seawater temperatures (by 0.9 up to 6.2 degrees C, in the case of these Panama Basin samples).},

abstract = {The 87Sr/86Sr ratios and Sr concentrations in sediment and pore fluids are used to evaluate the rates of calcite recrystallization at ODP Site 807A on the Ontong Java Plateau, an 800-meter thick section of carbonate ooze and chalk. A numerical model is used to evaluate the pore fluid chemistry and Sr isotopes in an accumulating section. The deduced calcite recrystallization rate is 2{\%} per million years ({\%}/Myr) near the top of the section and decreases systematically in older parts of the section such that the rate is close to 0.1/age (in years). The deduced recrystallization rates have important implications for the interpretation of Ca and Mg concentration profiles in the pore fluids. The effect of calcite recrystallization on pore fluid chemistry is described by the reaction length, L, which varies by element, and depends on the concentration in pore fluid and solid. When L is small compared to the thickness of the sedimentary section, the pore fluid concentration is controlled by equilibrium or steady-state exchange with the solid phase, except within a distance L of the sediment-water interface. When L is large relative to the thickness of sediment, the pore fluid concentration is mostly controlled by the boundary conditions and diffusion. The values of L for Ca, Sr, and Mg are of order 15, 150, and 1500 meters, respectively. LSr is derived from isotopic data and modeling, and allows us to infer the values of LCa and LMg. The small value for LCa indicates that pore fluid Ca concentrations, which gradually increase down section, must be equilibrium values that are maintained by solution-precipitation exchange with calcite and do not reflect Ca sources within or below the sediment column. The pore fluid Ca measurements and measured alkalinity allow us to calculate the in situ pH in the pore fluids, which decreases from 7.6 near the sediment-water interface to 7.1 ?? 0.1 at 400-800 mbsf. While the calculated pH values are in agreement with some of the values measured during ODP Leg 130, most of the measurements are artifacts. The large value for LMg indicates that the pore fluid Mg concentrations at 807A are not controlled by calcite-fluid equilibrium but instead are determined by the changing Mg concentration of seawater during deposition, modified by aqueous diffusion in the pore fluids. We use the pore fluid Mg concentration profile at Site 807A to retrieve a global record for seawater Mg over the past 35 Myr, which shows that seawater Mg has increased rapidly over the past 10 Myr, rather than gradually over the past 60 Myr. This observation suggests that the Cenozoic rise in seawater Mg is controlled by continental weathering inputs rather than by exchange with oceanic crust. The relationship determined between reaction rate and age in silicates and carbonates is strikingly similar, which suggests that reaction affinity is not the primary determinant of silicate dissolution rates in nature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {John Martin's vision, intellect, and drive resulted in a remarkable achievement-an unprecedented experiment to test his idea that iron limitation can control the biomass and productivity of phytoplankton in the open ocean. The result would surely have gratified him immensely, and rightly so: after a patch of surface water in the equatorial Pacific Ocean was enriched with iron, chlorophyll concentration doubled and primary productivity increased by a factor of four. Clearly, iron had affected the net growth of phytoplankton. Enrichment of the open ocean, a contentious proposition, was undertaken only after vigorous debate before and during a special symposium organized by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography. The debate was fruitful indeed; a broad cross-section of the oceanographic community reported their results and discussed their ideas, and consensus was reached on a variety of issues, including the need for a modestly scaled ocean enrichment experiment. It seems clear that open discussion of the controversial topic, even by those who presented ideas and alternate interpretations rather than original results, was healthy. In that spirit, I offer some comments on the iron hypothesis as research on the topic enters a new stage.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {A gigantic {\~{}}12 km3 landslide detached from the west wall of Lake Tahoe (California-Nevada, USA), and slid 15 km east across the lake. The splash, or tsunami, from this landslide eroded Tioga-age moraines dated as 21 ka. Lake-bottom short piston cores recovered sediment as old as 12 ka that did not reach landslide deposits, thereby constraining the landslide age as 21-12 ka. Movement of the landslide splashed copious water onto the countryside and lowered the lake level {\~{}}10 m. The sheets of water that washed back into the lake dumped their sediment load at the lowered shoreline, producing deltas that merged into delta terraces. During rapid growth, these unstable delta terraces collapsed, disaggregated, and fed turbidity currents that generated 15 subaqueous sediment wave channel systems that ring the lake and descend to the lake floor at 500 m depth. Sheets of water commonly more than 2 km wide at the shoreline fed these systems. Channels of the systems contain sediment waves (giant ripple marks) with maximum wavelengths of 400 m. The lower depositional aprons of the system are surfaced by sediment waves with maximum wavelengths of 300 m. A remarkably similar, though smaller, contemporary sediment wave channel system operates at the mouth of the Squamish River in British Columbia. The system is generated by turbidity currents that are fed by repeated growth and collapse of the active river delta. The Tahoe splash-induced backwash was briefly equivalent to more than 15 Squamish Rivers in full flood and would have decimated life in low-lying areas of the Tahoe region. {\textcopyright} 2014 Geological Society of America.},

Mn Ca ranges from less than 20 ?? 10-6 in and above the MnO2 maximum to as high as 700 ?? 10-6 in reducing Panama Basin sediments. The most plausible explanation for this enrichment is that the tests are coated with Mn carbonate overgrowths. These coatings can account for a significant proportion of the Mn in reduced deep-sea sediments. Uptake of manganous ion by carbonate may explain the absence of Mn nodules in areas of high carbonate accumulation. Extreme degrees of overgrowth can alter foram trace element values, but this artifact can be avoided by avoiding foraminifera with high Mn/Ca. ?? 1983.},

The mean concentration of cadmium was 60 ± 27 ng/kg and the median concentration of particulate cadmium was 0.2 ng/kg. Although there are regional differences in dissolved cadmium concentrations among stations, it is suggested that cadmium behaves essentially as an inert element in sea water. Particulate cadmium is enriched by about a factor of four in samples from less than 400 m compared to samples from deeper than 1000 m. The high concentrations in surface waters are suggested to be due to aeolian transport of anthropogenically derived cadmium. Additional analyses of cadmium in the Gulf of Maine show a mean value of 230 ng/kg. The higher values in the Gulf of Maine are ascribed to the influence of continental runoff. Twelve sediment samples from the open North Atlantic show a relatively homogenous distribution, ranging from 0.13 to 0.21 ppm on a dry-weight basis. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

abstract = {Vase-shaped microfossils (VSMs) occur globally in Neoproterozoic rocks, but until now their biological relationships have remained problematic. Exceptionally preserved new populations from the uppermost Chuar Group, Grand Canyon, Arizona, display details of morphology and taphonomy that collectively point to affinities with the testate amoebae. The fossils are tear-shaped tests, similar to 20-300 mu m long and similar to 10-200 mu m wide, that are circular in transverse section, expand aborally toward a rounded or slightly pointed pole, and taper orally toward a "neck" that ends in a single aperture. Apertures may be circular, hexagonal, triangular, or crenulate, and may be rimmed by a distinct collar. Approximately 25{\%} of the Chuar VSMs are curved, such that the oral and aboral poles do not lie opposite each other. Tests are preserved as mineralized casts and molds, commonly coated with organic debris or iron minerals, but they were originally composed of nonresistant organic matter. Approximately 1{\%} have a "honeycomb-patterned" wall attributable to the original presence of mineralized scales whose bases were arranged regularly in the test wall. Scale-bearing restate amoebae, such as members of the Euglyphidae, are essentially identical to the honeycomb VSMs, and a close relationship between other Grand Canyon VSMs and additional testate amoebae, both lobose and filose, is likely. The VSM population therefore most likely represents a multispecies assemblage whose spatial association reflects a common habitat and/or taphonomic circumstances that favor test preservation. The assignment of these fossils to the testate amoebae strengthens the case for a major diversification of eukaryotic organisms by mid-Neoproterozoic times and, more significantly, provides the earliest morphological evidence for heterotrophic eukaryotes in marine ecosystems.},

Synthetic systems have highlighted the importance of electrostatic binding or association, geometric matching (epitaxis), and stereochemical correspondence in these recognition processes. Similarly, organic molecules in solution can influence the morphology of inorganic crystals if there is molecular complementarity at the crystal-additive interface. A biomimetic approach based on these principles could lead to the development of new strategies in the controlled synthesis of inorganic nanophases, the crystal engineering of bulk solids, and the assembly of organized composite and ceramic materials.},

The electronic structure of this system is studied by near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The thickness of the h-BN is estimated to be about two-layers from XPS. B K-edge NEXAFS spectra show new ??* peak which is not observed in the spectrum for bulk h-BN. From a polarization dependence analysis of NEXAFS, we propose this new ??* peak originates from the interaction between the h-BN and Ni(1 1 1). This new ??* peak clearly proves that conduction band of h-BN/Ni(1 1 1) is different from that of bulk h-BN. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Climate change over the past approximately 30 years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species and has been implicated in one species-level extinction. Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20{\%} of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37{\%} of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction ( approximately 18{\%}) than mid-range ( approximately 24{\%}) and maximum-change ( approximately 35{\%}) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {The prolamin box (P-box) is a highly conserved 7-bp sequence element (5'-TGTAAAG-3') found in the promoters of many cereal seed storage protein genes. Nuclear factors from maize endosperm specifically interact with the P-box present in maize prolamin genes (zeins). The presence of the P-box in all zein gene promoters suggests that interactions between endosperm DNA binding proteins and the P-box may play an important role in the coordinate activation of zein gene expression during endosperm development. We have cloned an endosperm-specific maize cDNA, named prolamin-box binding factor (PBF), that encodes a member of the recently described Dof class of plant Cys2-Cys2 zinc-finger DNA binding proteins. When tested in gel shift assays, PBF exhibits the same sequence-specific binding to the P-box as factors present in maize endosperm nuclei. Additionally, PBF interacts in vitro with the basic leucine zipper protein Opaque2, a known transcriptional activator of zein gene expression whose target site lies 20 bp downstream of the P-box in the 22-kDa zein gene promoter. The isolation of the PBF gene provides an essential tool to further investigate the functional role of the highly conserved P-box in regulating cereal storage protein gene expression.},

Studies of biogenic ACC show that there are significant structural differences, including the observation that the stable forms are hydrated whereas the transient forms are not. The many different ways in which ACC can be formed in vitro shed light on the possible mechanisms involved in stabilization, destabilization, and transformation of ACC into crystalline forms of calcium carbonate. We show here that ACC is a fascinating form of calcium carbonate that may well be of much interest to materials science and biomineralization.},

abstract = {We tested the decision-making abilities of emigrating ant colonies. The colonies had to choose a new nest site when presented with two or more potential nest sites, each with different attributes or different combinations of attributes. For Leptothorax albipennis colonies in the laboratory, darkness of the nest cavity, internal height of the cavity and width of the entrance were all important attributes. The colonies ranked these attributes: darkness of the nest site was more important than internal cavity height, which in turn was more important than entrance width. These choices conform to the logic of transitivity. In addition, the colonies used a sophisticated decision-making strategy in which they took all alternatives and all attributes into consideration. Furthermore, the ants, in effect, weighed the different values of different attributes. They also chose the best nest when presented with only one excellent nest among four mediocre ones or one excellent nest in an array of one excellent, one good and one mediocre. Altogether, our results suggest that these ant colonies, in deciding upon a new home, used a weighted additive strategy, one of the most computationally expensive and thorough decision-making strategies.

abstract = {The development of catchment-scale stream rehabilitation programmes in many parts of the world marks a shift from the application of reach-based engineering principles towards an adoption of ecosystem-centred, adaptive and participatory approaches to river management. From a biophysical viewpoint, this represents recognition of the importance of the inherent geodiversity of aquatic ecosystems and the benefits that are gained through enhancing natural recovery mechanisms. As this approach to river management matures, it is important that its key elements and assumptions are subjected to critical appraisal. In this paper, the main features of contemporary catchment-wide programmes are examined through a review of pertinent literature and through examination of various case studies from North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Emerging challenges and tensions include those of generating an authentic and functional biophysical vision at the catchment scale, of developing a proactive adaptive management approach, of achieving genuine community participation and of integrating biophysical and social factors in a transdisciplinary framework. Issues of scale, natural variability and complexity must be addressed in meeting these challenges.},

abstract = {Changes in the distribution of the preservation and burial of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in deep ocean sediments and associated atmospheric pCO(2) response to the shutdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) are examined using an Earth system model. We find that shutdown of the Atlantic MOC forced by the freshwater inflow significantly decreases the CaCO3 content in North Atlantic sediments. This is a consequence of a decrease in bottom-water carbonate ion concentrations and reduction in sea-surface CaCO3 production. The main sedimentary impacts of these two effects are separated in time, however, with reduced CaCO3 production dominating the decrease in CaCO3 burial during the first 1000 years after the forcing is applied. In the absence of significant overturning circulation in the Atlantic, atmospheric pCO(2) increases by 11 ppm, largely due to a decrease in POC export and a weakening biological pump. The change in pCO(2) induced by reorganization of CaCO3 burial in deep-sea sediments is small, only 1 ppm, because increased preservation of CaCO3 in the Pacific largely efficiently buffers decreased preservation in the Atlantic, leaving the global burial and ocean alkalinity minimally changed at equilibrium.},

@article{Tang2008b,
abstract = {Partitioning of strontium during spontaneous calcite formation was experimentally studied using an advanced CO2-diffusion technique. Results at different precipitation rates and T = 5, 25, and 40 °C show that at constant temperature Sr incorporation into calcite is controlled by the precipitation rate (R in $\mu$mol/m2/h) according to the individual expressions(log DSr = (0.319 ± 0.042) {\textperiodcentered} log R - 1.80 ± 0.11; log DSr = (0.214 ± 0.026) {\textperiodcentered} log R - 1.67 ± 0.09; log DSr = (0.095 ± 0.031) {\textperiodcentered} log R - 1.42 ± 0.09)at 5, 25, and 40 °C, respectively. High rates induce less Sr partitioning (i.e., high Sr distribution coefficients of Sr) in calcite (DSr). DSr value and rate dependency decreases with increasing temperature. This indicates that effect of R is more significant at lower T. Both R and DSr are also apparently influenced by solution chemistry (i.e., pH). The strontium incorporation behavior during precipitation of calcite can be reasonably explained by the Surface Entrapment Model (SEMO) adapted from Watson and Liang (Watson E. B. and Liang Y. (1995) A simple model for sector zoning in slowly grown crystals: implications for growth rate and lattice diffusion, with emphasis on accessory minerals in crustal rocks. Am. Miner. 80, 1179-1187). According to SEMO Sr is significantly enriched in the surface layer of the growing calcite. Sr incorporation into the final calcite crystal lattice depends on the estimated value of the Sr entrapment factor for the surface layer, crystal growth kinetics, and ion diffusion behavior within the proposed surface layer. SEMO is a valid theoretical concept to elucidate mechanisms and kinetics of Sr incorporation into inorganic calcite within the range of the experimental conditions used in this study. Accordingly, apparent DSr values in natural and applied systems can be used as an environmental proxy for inorganic calcite growth behavior at the present aqueous molar Sr/Ca ratios between 0.01 and 0.00006. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The material used in this study includes samples from the South Atlantic (DSDP Sites 356, 527 and 525A), North Atlantic (Sites 384 and 548A), Indian and Pacific Oceans (DSDP Site 465A and ODP Sites 761C and 762C) and Tethyan Ocean (outcrop sections from El-Kef and Caravaca). On average 45 specimens from two samples per location were analysed, from an interval corresponding approximately to the last 60 kyr of the Cretaceous. No differences in coiling direction (dextral proportions were gt 90{\%} in all samples), percentage of kummerform specimens (usually gt 50{\%}) and number of chambers in the last whorl (4-5) were observed between the sites. Both test size (expressed as spiral outline area and test volume) and total number of chambers increase significantly towards lower latitudes. Similarly, test conicity, examined by shape coordinate and eigenshape methods, and angularity of the spiral outline show a rather continuous, slight increase towards lower latitudes. Kummerform specimens of C. contusa were slightly larger and more conical than normalforms and possessed substantially more chambers (both totally and in the last whorl. A principal components analysis of the sample means of five variables describing size and shape clearly distinguished high-latitude sites (525A, 527, 548A, 761C and 762C) from low-latitude sites (384, 465A, Caravaca and El-Kef). Specimens from Site 356 are transitional with respect to those two groups. The results indicate: (1) considerable morphological variation in C. contusa during the terminal Cretaceous comparable to that known in many Recent planktic foraminiferal species and (2) a geographical distribution of this variation corresponding to previously suggested biogeographic schemes based on quantitative analysis of planktic foraminiferal assemblages. Despite the differences in sample means, the overall morphology of C. contusa overlaps among the sites studied, supporting the classification of all C. contusa morphotypes as a single species. Similarly, no discrete morphologic groups could be distinguished within any of the samples},

abstract = {We conducted a scanning electron microscopic survey of morphological variations in the calcareous nanoplankton species Emiliania huxleyi in Southern Ocean surface water samples collected along a transect from 43 to 64 degrees S and 141 to 145 degrees E during November 2001, October to February 2002/2003, 2003/2004, 2004/2005 and 2005/2006. The results were compared with historical data from a similar transect occupied in December to January 1983/1984 and January to February 1994 and 1995. While E. huxleyi was absent or extremely sparse (0.1 to 1 cells ml(-1)) south of 60 degrees S in 1983/1984 and 1994/1995, this species was consistently present at about 100 cells ml(-1) between 60 and 65 degrees S during 2002 to 2006. The extended geographic range and/or increased southward abundance of this keystone species suggests a significant shift in Southern Ocean ecology over the past 2 decades, analogous to an observed recent range extension into the Bering Sea. Morphotype A 'overcalcified' mainly occurred north of the Subantarctic Front and was replaced by the weakly calcified Morphotype B/C between the Subantarctic Front and Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. This north-south shift in E. huxleyi calcification morphotypes closely tracked the north-south decline in the calcite saturation state as calculated from carbonate system measurements. Based on current evidence, no significant changes are apparent in the calcification status of E. huxleyi in the Southern Ocean during the past 12 yr. All cultured isolates from north of the Polar Front belonged to Morphotype A, while all strains isolated south of the Polar Front belonged to Morphotype B/C and their morphologies appeared conservative in culture. The north-south trend of decreased calcification of E. huxleyi in the Southern Ocean thus reflects the shift in dominance of one ecotype to another, rather than the environmental effect of decreased carbonatre ion concentrations and calcite saturation state on a single, 'apparently cosmopolitan', population.},

abstract = {We measured resistance of crushing of three species of larger benthic foraminifera from Bermuda: Archaias angulatus, Amphistegina gibbosa, and Laevipeneroplis proteus. Tests of living individuals collected from a high-energy exposed reef were markedly harder to crush than similar-sized tests of living individuals of the same and other species from a low-energy sheltered seagrass flat. This correlation shows that even though these epibiontic species live on substrates such as seagrasses and coral rubble rather than in the sediment, test strength is important for survival as it is in smaller sediment-dwelling foraminifera. The increase in test strength in high-energy environments may be a response to the likelihood of removal from substrates by wave and current action.Test weight differed slightly between populations from the two environments, but probably not enough to account for the observed difference in resistance to crushing. Differences in test weight between species were minor despite major differences in test morphology and wall microstructure.},

abstract = {Significant variations in the Sr/Ca in waters from the eastern Indian Ocean in the vicinity of Australia, both from the surface and from shallow depth profiles, are documented. The strontium sulfate-secreting protozoans Acantharia, which are common in the upper 400 m of the oceans, especially at low latitudes, contribute substantially to changes in the Sr/Ca of oceanic waters by extracting Sr for the formation of their skeletons. Below such depths, these organisms dissolve and the Sr/Ca of seawater regains its ‘conservative' nature. This mechanism accounts for some of the variability of the Sr/Ca near the surface of the ocean, but this may still be found at depth as surface waters become entrained at greater depths. It is argued here that the noted Sr/Ca variations may explain discrepancies between coral data sets from different parts of the oceans, and calls for caution when reconstructing sea-surface temperatures from the Sr/Ca of corals.},

However, the evidence is still far from proving whether the long-term consumption of GM foods posses a possible danger for human or animal health. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effects of transgenic corn on the rats that were fed through three generations with either GM corn or its conventional counterpart. Tissue samples of stomach, duodenum, liver and kidney were obtained for histopathological examinations. The average diameter of glomeruli, thickness of renal cortex and glomerular volume were calculated and number of affected animals/number of examined animals for liver and kidney histopathology were determined. Amounts of urea, urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, total protein, albumin and globulin were determined; enzyme activities of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyltransferase, creatine kinase and amylase were measured in serum samples. No statistically significant differences were found in relative organ weights of rats within groups but there were some minimal histopathological changes in liver and kidney. Changes in creatinine, total protein and globulin levels were also determined in biochemical analysis. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The chemical composition and charge of the biotite near-surface, in contact with NaCl bearing aqueous solutions at 25??C from pH 1 to 12, have been derived via zeta potential measurements and potentiometric titrations performed for 20 and 60min in batch reactors. Zeta potential measurements yielded an isoelectric point of pH 3.0 (??0.2) and batch potentiometric titrations yielded a pH of immersion of 9.66 (S.D. 0.24). From batch potentiometric titrations we determined both the proton consumption and the metal release from the biotite surface as a function of pH. Potassium removal from the near-surface of biotite is only slightly dependent on pH with a minimum of {\~{}}6atomsnm-2 removed at the immersion pH, corresponding to an average depletion depth of {\~{}}1.5nm. In contrast, the release of Mg, Al and Fe is strongly pH-dependent as those metals are preferentially removed from the biotite surface at pH less than 9 (Mg) and 4 (Al, Fe). The average depletion depth of Mg, Al, and Fe increases with decreasing pH, reaching on average {\~{}}2nm at pH {\~{}}1. The removal of K, Mg, Al, and Fe is not charge conservative, resulting in a relative negative charge in the biotite near-surface. Taken together, our results indicate that the composition of the biotite surface varies dramatically as a function of pH. At basic conditions, the biotite near-surface is K depleted and likely hydrogen enriched. At near-neutral conditions, the biotite near-surface is comprised of only the Si and Al tetrahedral, and the Fe(II) octahedral framework, following the removal of both alkali metals and Mg. Finally, at acidic conditions, the biotite near-surface is comprised exclusively of a remnant Si, O and H framework. The results of these experiments give an indication of the composition and charge of the biotite surface in the natural environment, following contact with water, for example in the vadose zone, and can help us understand weathering reactions in these systems. ?? 2013.},

The fluxes between these reservoirs are relatively rapid such that the oceans have taken up around 48{\%} of anthropogenic CO2 released to the atmosphere. Elevated CO2 can potentially affect many processes in marine biogeochemistry and each of these affects will be at least non-linear and potentially complex. Both positive and negative feedback mechanisms exist, making prediction of the consequences of changing CO2 levels difficult. Although many relevant processes are understood, others such as CO2 induced acidification of the marine system have only recently emerged as serious issues, backed up by experimental studies. Integrating the net effect of these processes on regional and basin scales is the outstanding challenge which we aim to address via marine system modelling.},

Annual pH ranges are found to vary from {\textless} 0.2 in areas of low biological activity to {\textgreater} 1.0 in areas influenced by riverine signals, consistent with observations and previous studies. It is shown that benthic, as well as pelagic, activity is an important factor in this variability. The acidification of the region due to increased fluxes of atmospheric CO2 into the marine system is calculated and shown to exceed, on average, 0.1??pH units over the next 50 years and result in a total acidification of 0.5??pH units below pre-industrial levels at atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 1000??ppm. The potential for measurable changes in biogeochemistry are demonstrated by simulating the observed inhibition of pelagic nitrification with decreasing pH. However, we conclude that there is a lack of knowledge of how acidification might affect the complex interaction of processes that govern marine biogeochemical cycles and a consequent need for further research and observations. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The effects of Quaternary sea level changes on the Sr budget of the ocean are investigated using coupled numerical models of the seawater Sr and Ca budgets. Glacial/interglacial sea level cycles influence the Sr concentration of seawater directly through the periodic exposure and weathering of aragonite on continental shelves and indirectly by modulating the location and extent of carbonate deposition in the ocean. As sea level recedes, brief pulses of Sr are added to the ocean from recrystallization of shelf aragonite; this flux at its maximum is nearly ten times larger than the combined riverine and hydrothermal influx. The large shelf recrystallization fluxes during glacial maxima produce rapid increases in the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater despite the long residence time of Sr in the ocean. Variations in the ratio of aragonitic vs. calcitic sedimentation also influence on the Sr content of seawater because the Sr partitioning coefficient is higher in aragonite; however, this effect is minor compared to shelf aragonite recrystallization. Based on a variety of sensitivity tests, the amplitude of Sr/Ca variations ranges from 1 to 3{\%} and is maximized by constant rates of total carbonate deposition, extensive aragonite recrystallization, and carbonate budgets which include dissolution of shelf carbonates. Such variation is sufficient to produce up to 1.5??C errors in paleotemperatures calculated from coral Sr/Ca ratios since the last glacial maximum.},

abstract = {Dentin may be regarded as a mineralized connective tissue. In its composition as well as its mode of formation, dentin exhibits several similarities with bone, but also definite differences. The dentin organic phase, the matrix, determines its morphology and is believed to be instrumental in the formation of the mineral phase. A fibrous web of collagen type I dominates the organic matrix. Also, minor amounts of other collagen types may be present. The noncollagenous proteins (NCPs), which constitute about 10{\%} of the matrix, fall into several categories: phosphoproteins, Gla-proteins of the osteocalcin type as well as matrix Gla-protein, proteoglycans, different acidic glycoproteins, and serum proteins. Some of these NCPs have unique chemical compositions that give them specific properties. Dentinogenesis occurs by two simultaneous processes: the formation of a collagenous web in predentin, which is followed by the formation of the inorganic phase at the mineralization front. The composition of the predentin organic matrix differs from that of dentin, as some NCP components are secreted extracellularly just in advance of the mineralization front. In addition, some constituents of predentin seem to be metabolized. The NCPs may be important to several processes during dentinogenesis. Much evidence indicates that noncollagenous components in the matrix are instrumental in mineral formation. New data show that polyanionic NCPs, such as phosphoprotein and proteoglycans, when immobilized on a solid support, induce apatite formation under physiological conditions. These data indicate that polyanionic NCPs may function as mineral nucleators in vivo. They may also act as size and rate regulators for crystallization and promote calcium ion diffusion in the tissue. In addition, NCPs may regulate collagen fibrillogenesis.},

abstract = {Most of the marine phytoplankton species for which data are available are rate saturated for photosynthesis and probably for growth with inorganic C at normal seawater concentrations; 2 of the 17 species are not saturated. Photosynthesis in these two species can probably be explained by assuming that CO2 reaches the site of its reaction with RUBISCO (ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase) by passive diffusion. The kinetics of CO2 fixation by intact cells are explicable by RUBISCO kinetics typical of (eucaryotic) algae, and a CO2-saturated in vivo RUBISCO activity not more than twice the in vivo light- and inorganic-C-saturated rate of photosynthesis. For the other species, the high affinity in vivo for inorganic C (and several other attributes) could be explained by postulating active influx of inorganic C yielding a higher concentration of CO2 available to RUBISCO during steady state photosynthesis than in the medium. Although such a higher concentration of internal CO2 in cells with high affinity for inorganic C is found at low (subseawater) levels of external inorganic C, the situation is more equivocal at normal seawater concentrations. In theory, the occurrence of a CO2-concentrating mechanism rather than passive CO2 entry (with consequent glycolate synthesis and metabolism or excretion) could reduce the photon, N, Fe, Mn, and Mo costs of growth, but increase the Zn and Se costs. Thus far, data on costs are available only for photons and N; these data generally agree with the predicted lower costs for cells with high affinity for inorganic C. The ecological significance of these attributes is that most marine phytoplankters are not likely to have photosynthetic or growth rates reduced by the measured decreases in inorganic C in productive seawater, drawdown of inorganic C in productive seawater (or increase as atmospheric CO2 increases) might alter the competitive balance between cells with low and high affinity for inorganic C, and differences in the effectiveness of use of other resources between cells with high and low affinity could cause differences in the rate and extent of resource-limited growth for communities dominated by high-affinity or low-affinity cells.},

abstract = {Extracellular proteins have long been implicated in the control of mineralization. Cuticular proteins of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, undergo changes concurrent with mineralization after molting. A pH drift in vitro mineralization assay was used to assess the effects of cuticular extracts on the inhibition of crystal deposition and the morphology of the resulting crystals. Crystal nucleation was strongly delayed by material extracted into 2{\%} acetic acid within the first 1.5 h post-ecdysis. This effect was not seen with other extracts. No consistent effects of the cuticular extracts on calcium carbonate crystal morphology were observed. Proteins associating with these crystals were extracted and subjected to electrophoresis. These crystal-associated proteins (CAPs) differed depending upon the extraction method and the time after ecdysis when the crab was sacrificed. The early acetic acid extracts produced a unique combination of CAP bands at 66, 42 and 24 kDa. These results are consistent with a model of mineralization in C. sapidus involving (a) certain proteins serving as nucleation sites and attached to the cuticle at all times by acid labile bonds, and (b) other proteins acting as inhibitors of crystal nucleation until being altered at approximately 1 h post-ecdysis.

abstract = {The Younger Dryas, the last large millennial-scale climate oscillation (12.9–11.6 ka), has been widely attributed to a massive meltwater discharge event that disrupted ocean circulation and plunged the circum–North Atlantic back into a near-glacial state. Low-resolution deep-water reconstructions indicate lower North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) production during the Younger Dryas, though the $\Delta$14C record requires some deep-water production. Herein, we reconstruct deep-water mass variations using a southern Gardar Drift sediment core with an expanded Younger Dryas section. We show that southern-sourced water invaded the deep North Atlantic to start the Younger Dryas, but was replaced by NADW within 500 yr. Southern-sourced waters briefly reappeared at the end of the Younger Dryas. These deep-water reorganizations to start and end the Younger Dryas suggest that increased meltwater fluxes were limited temporally and focused on regions where deep-water convection occurred during the deglaciation.},

abstract = {Two coccolithophore blooms in the Gulf of Maine were studied in 1988 and 1989. Each bloom was about 50,000 km* in area and confined to the top 20 m of the water column. Maximal cell concentrations were -2,000 cells ml-* and coccolith densities of 3 x lo5 ml-' were observed. The coccolith : cell ratio was highest in the bloom center (region of most intense reflectance) and lowest at the bloom periphery, an indication of varying organic vs. inorganic C production. Chlorophyll concentrations were generally low within the bloom and no relation could be observed between major nutrients and coccolithophore abundance. Backscattered light was profoundly affected by coccolith density and was slightly wavelength-dependent. We calculated total backscattering as well as backscattering (bh) caused exclusively by coccoliths and derived the algorithm relating coccolith density to backscattering. Although cells were efficient light absorbers, coccoliths showed negligible light absorption. Diffuse attenuation was lowest in the green and blue-green part of the visible spectrum. At the center of the bloom, coccoliths contributed {\~{}}75{\%} of the backscattering signal and {\textgreater} 50{\%} of the beam attenuation signal. The most accurate way to estimate coccolith concen- trations via remote sensing is to measure water-leaving radiance in the green wavebands.},

We discuss the urgent need to expand the concept of essential fish habitat to include important food-web relationships. The need for a broader perspective in terms of ecosystem function and the effects of interactive stressors is emphasized to maintain the vitality and resilience of valued ecosystems. Maintenance of multiple ecosystem functions is a key factor in the adaptive capacity of ecosystems to change.

abstract = {Surface seawaters are supersaturated with respect to calcite, but high concentrations of magnesium prevent spontaneous nucleation and growth of crystals. Foraminifera are the most widespread group of calcifying organisms and generally produce calcite with a low Mg content, indicating that they actively remove Mg(2+) from vacuolized seawater before calcite precipitation. However, one order of foraminifera has evolved a calcification pathway, by which it produces calcite with a very high Mg content, suggesting that these species do not alter the Mg/Ca ratio of vacuolized seawater considerably. The cellular mechanism that makes it possible to precipitate calcite at high Mg concentrations, however, has remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that they are able to elevate the pH at the site of calcification by at least one unit above seawater pH and, thereby, overcome precipitation-inhibition at ambient Mg concentrations. A similar result was obtained for species that precipitate calcite with a low Mg concentration, suggesting that elevating the pH at the site of calcification is a widespread strategy among foraminifera to promote calcite precipitation. Since the common ancestor of these two groups dates back to the Cambrian, our results would imply that this physiological mechanism has evolved over half a billion years ago. Since foraminifera rely on elevating the intracellular pH for their calcification, our results show that ongoing ocean acidification can result in a decrease of calcite production by these abundant calcifyers.},

abstract = {The high incidence of coral disease in shallow coastal marine environments suggests seawater depth and coastal pollution have an impact on the microbial communities inhabiting healthy coral tissues. A study was undertaken to determine how bacterial communities inhabiting tissues of the coral Montastraea annularis change at 5 m, 10 m and 20 m water depth in varying proximity to the urban centre and seaport of Willemstad, Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. Analyses of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (TRFLP) of 16S rRNA gene sequences show significant differences in bacterial communities of polluted and control localities only at the shallowest seawater depth. Furthermore, distinct differences in bacterial communities were found with increasing water depth. Comparisons of TRFLP peaks with sequenced clone libraries indicate the black band disease cyanobacterium clone CD1C11 is common and most abundant on healthy corals in less than 10 m water depth. Similarly, sequences belonging to a previously unrecognized group of likely phototrophic bacteria, herein referred to as CAB-I, were also more common in shallow water. To assess the influence of environmental and physiologic factors on bacterial community structure, canonical correspondence analysis was performed using explanatory variables associated with: (i) light availability; (ii) seawater pollution; (iii) coral mucus composition; (iv) the community structure of symbiotic algae; and (v) the photosynthetic activity of symbiotic algae. Eleven per cent of the variation in bacterial communities was accounted for by covariation with these variables; the most important being photosynthetically active radiation (sunlight) and the coral uptake of sewage-derived compounds as recorded by the delta(15)N of coral tissue.},

Calcified marine organisms, including thecosomatous pteropods, foraminifers, cold-water corals, sea urchins, molluscs, and coralline algae, make up significant components of the rich communities in high latitudes, and they are thought to be at risk with increasing ocean acidification. Over the next decades, trends of rising temperatures and species invasions coupled with progressive ocean acidification are expected to increasingly influence both planktonic and benthic marine communities of Antarctica and the Arctic.

abstract = {The present work is an attempt to establish the stable isotope database for Mesozoic to Tertiary coals from the Pannonian Basin, Hungary. Maceral composition, proximate analysis, sulphur form, sulphur isotopes (organic and pyritic), and carbon isotopes were determined. This database supports the assessment of the environmental risks associated with energy generation, the characterization of the formation and the distribution of sulphur in the coals used. The maceral composition, the sulphur composition, the C, S isotopic signatures, and some of the geological evidences published earlier show that the majority of these coals were deposited in freshwater and brackish water environments, despite the relatively high average sulphur content. However, the Upper Cretaceous, Eocene, and Lower Miocene formations also contain coal seams of marine origin, as indicated by their maceral composition and sulphur and carbon chemistry. The majority of the sulphur in these coals occurs in the organic form. All studied sulphur phases are relatively rich in 34S isotopes ($\delta$34Sorganic = + 12.74‰, $\delta$34Spyrite = + 10.06‰, on average). This indicates that marine bacterial sulphate reduction played a minor role in their formation, in the sense that isotopic fractionation was limited. It seems that the interstitial spaces of the peat closed rapidly during early diagenesis due to a regime of high depositional rate, leading to a relative enrichment of the heavy sulphur isotopes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Wolf-Gladrow1999,
abstract = {Foraminifera are the most important source of information for oceanographic and climatic reconstruction on glacial-interglacial as well as on much longer time-scales. The information is contained in the chemical composition, especially the isotopic ratios, of the calcitic shells (e.g., ??11B, ??13C, ??18O). Based on the assumption that our understanding of the major parameters controlling stable isotope incorporation is complete, these geochemical proxies have been used to reconstruct glacial ice volumes, sea surface and deep water temperatures, ocean circulation changes and shifts between carbon reservoirs. However, recent laboratory experiments have demonstrated that the ??13C and ??18O are not only strongly dependent on the carbonate chemistry of the culture medium but that the so-called 'vital-effects' are probably mediated via perturbations of the local carbonate system. These findings have an important impact on the interpretation of isotope data. For instance, the carbonate system of the glacial ocean was quite different from that of the Holocene and since the onset of the industrial revolution the carbonate chemistry of the surface water must have changed drastically. As a first step towards a better understanding of the isotopic fractionation processes we present results of a diffusion-reaction model of the carbonate system (CO2, HCO3/-, CO3/2-, H+, OH-, B(OH)3, B(OH)4/-) in the microenvironment (the diffusive boundary layer) of living planktic foraminifera. The carbon fluxes associated with the main life processes (calcification, respiration and symbiont photosynthesis) lead to substantial perturbations in pH and significant shifts in the concentrations of CO2, CO3/2- and other components in the vicinity of the foraminifer. Consequently, the carbonate chemistry of the ambient environment is quite different from that of the bulk sea water. Comparison with pH-microelectrode measurements confirm our numerical results. Our results further demonstrate that the symbionts must use bicarbonate as an additional carbon source for photosynthesis as the calculated CO2 fluxes are not sufficient to support measured rates of oxygen evolution. The simulations also show that for the fast calcification of Globigerinoides sacculifer the supply of carbonate ions is insufficient and therefore use of bicarbonate or an internal pool for carbon is required, whereas no such pool is necessary for the much slower calcification in Orbulina universa.},

It is shown that diatom dominance occurred irrespective of season if silicate concentration exceeded a threshold of approximately 2-mu-M. Flagellate dominance changed to diatom dominance within a few days after nutrient addition resulting in silicate concentrations above this threshold. Dominance of Phaeocystis sp. appeared on several occasions after the bloom of another species, but never at high silicate concentrations, The success of the diatom group seemed to be due to a high inherent growth rate at non-limiting silicate concentrations.

abstract = {We explore the applicability of paired Mg/Ca and 18O /16O measurements on benthic foraminifera from Southern Ocean site 747 to paleoceanographic reconstructions on pre-Pleistocene timescales. We focus on the late Oligocene through Pleistocene (27–0 Ma) history of paleotemperatures and the evolution of the $\delta$18O values of seawater ($\delta$18Osw) at a temporal resolution of ∼100–200 kyr. Absolute paleotemperature estimates depend on assumptions of how Mg/Ca ratios of seawater have changed over the past 27 Myr, but relative changes that occur on geologically brief timescales are robust. Results indicate that at the Oligocene to Miocene boundary (23.8 Ma), temperatures lag the increase in global ice-volume deduced from benthic foraminiferal $\delta$18O values, but the smaller-scale Miocene glaciations are accompanied by ocean cooling of ∼1°C. During the mid-Miocene phase of Antarctic ice sheet growth (∼15–13 Ma), water temperatures cool by ∼3°C. Unlike the benthic foraminiferal $\delta$18O values, which remain relatively constant thereafter, temperatures vary (by 3°C) and reach maxima at ∼12 and ∼8.5 Ma. The onset of significant Northern Hemisphere glaciation during the late Pliocene is synchronous with an ∼4°C cooling at site 747. A comparison of our $\delta$18Osw curve to the Haq et al. [1987] sea level curve yields excellent agreement between sequence boundaries and times of increasing seawater 18O /16O ratios. At ∼12–11 Ma in particular, when benthic foraminiferal $\delta$18O values do not support a further increase in ice volume, the $\delta$18Osw curve comes to a maximum that corresponds to a major mid-Miocene sea level regression. The agreement between the character of our Mg/Ca-based $\delta$18Osw curve and sequence stratigraphy demonstrates that benthic foramaniferal Mg/Ca ratios can be used to trace the $\delta$18Osw on pre-Pleistocene timescales despite a number of uncertainties related to poorly constrained temperature calibrations and paleoseawater Mg/Ca ratios. The Mg/Ca record also highlights that deep ocean temperatures can vary independently and unexpectedly from ice volume changes, which can lead to misinterpretations of the $\delta$18O record.},

abstract = {Increasing concern about the impacts of global warming on biodiversity has stimulated extensive discussion, but methods to translate broad-scale shifts in climate into direct impacts on living animals remain simplistic. A key missing element from models of climatic change impacts on animals is the buffering influence of behavioral thermoregulation. Here, we show how behavioral and mass/energy balance models can be combined with spatial data on climate, topography, and vegetation to predict impacts of increased air temperature on thermoregulating ectotherms such as reptiles and insects (a large portion of global biodiversity). We show that for most "cold-blooded" terrestrial animals, the primary thermal challenge is not to attain high body temperatures (although this is important in temperate environments) but to stay cool (particularly in tropical and desert areas, where ectotherm biodiversity is greatest). The impact of climate warming on thermoregulating ectotherms will depend critically on how changes in vegetation cover alter the availability of shade as well as the animals' capacities to alter their seasonal timing of activity and reproduction. Warmer environments also may increase maintenance energy costs while simultaneously constraining activity time, putting pressure on mass and energy budgets. Energy- and mass-balance models provide a general method to integrate the complexity of these direct interactions between organisms and climate into spatial predictions of the impact of climate change on biodiversity. This methodology allows quantitative organism- and habitat-specific assessments of climate change impacts.},

abstract = {All techniques employed in the preparation of samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) introduce or include artifacts that can degrade the images of the materials being studied. One significant cause of this image degradation is surface amorphization. The damaged top and bottom surface layers of TEM samples can obscure subtle detail, particularly at high magnification. Of the techniques typically used for TEM sample preparation of semiconducting materials, cleaving produces samples with the least surface amorphization, followed by low-angle ion milling, conventional ion milling, and focused ion beam (FIB) preparation. In this work, we present direct measurements of surface damage on silicon produced during TEM sample preparation utilizing these techniques. The thinnest damaged layer formed on a silicon surface was measured as 1.5nm thick, while an optimized FIB sample preparation process results in the formation of a 22nm thick damaged layer. Lattice images are obtainable from all samples. Copyright ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding the coupling of oxygen, carbon, and sulfur cycles in the past is critical for recon- structing the history of biogeochemical cycles, paleoclimatic variations, and oceanic chemistry. The abun- dance of sulfur isotopes (d34S) in sulfate from ancient marine carbonates, or carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS), is commonly used, along with other archives (mainly evaporites and barite), to estimate the d34Sof seawater throughout Earth history. Analyses of CAS from hand-picked foraminifera are potentially valuable because this group of organisms is used in numerous paleoceanographic studies. They could provide coupled, high-resolution records of d13C, d18O, and d34S isotopic changes directly linked to orbitally tuned records of climate change through the Cenozoic. Such measurements have not previously been possible due to limitations of sensitivity in conventional IRMS-based techniques. However, the recent development of CAS analysis by multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) now allows us to work on samples containing just a few nmol of sulfur with accuracy for d34S values approaching 0.1{\&} and, consequently, to analyze hand-picked samples of foraminifera shells. Here we report the results of cul- ture experiments with the planktonic species Orbulina universa, that establish a shell:seawater d34S calibra- tion for future applications to the fossil record. Our new method uses {\textless}650 lg of carbonate (?15 shells) per analysis. The results show that S isotopes are fractionated consistently by21{\&}between seawater and O. universa tests. We also demonstrate that O. universa faithfully records the [SO4 22]/[Ca21] ratio of the sea- water in which it grew.},

The foraminiferal sediment samples were taken from Svalbard, the Norwegian sea, the northwest European continental margin and from outcropping interglacial deposits in Denmark, West Germany and Norway. Despite great variation in aminoacid composition of the species, classification can be made at the genus level. Cibicides lobatus and Ammonia batava show a systematic change in amino-acid composition with increasing sample age, interred to be caused by diagenetic alteration of the amino acids, rather than by environmental differences. The variation in amido-acid composition within the species Cibicides wuellerstorfi and Bulimina marginata does not seem to be related to either environmental differences or diagenisis. The generic chemotaxomomy of these four species agrees with that based on the traditional morphotaxonomic methods can be applied as a supplement to traditional classification methods to confirm the considtency of taxonomy on a morphological level and to trace diagenetic changes in the geochemical of carbonate fossils.},

abstract = {Inorganic carbon uptake by phytoplankton depletes the immediate cell environment and disturbs the carbonate system equilibrium. Uptake is balanced by both diffusional transport across and chemical reactions within the depleted boundary layer. In this study, we have derived a model that simulates inorganic carbon diffusion and reactions in the vicinity of phytoplakton cells. To allow a general application of the model, the reaction kinetics of the carbonate system are reviewed and temperature- and salinity-dependence of the various rate constants are discussed. A consistency condition for some of the kinetic rates is derived. The effective thickness of the diffusive boundary layer in spherical and planar geometry is discussed. In addition, the effect of cell shape on diffusive transport to phytoplankton is examined and a simple means to account for this effect in model calculations is presented. In a second step, the complete description of the diffusion-reaction system is simplified to consider two special cases in which (1) algal production relies on CO2(aq) as the single source of inorganic carbon, and (2) CO2, HCO3/-, or CO3/2- are utilized independently for organic matter production combined with calcite precipitation. In the size range typical for phytoplankton cells model predictions of these simplified versions are nearly identical to those of the complete model indicating that the simplified models represent good approximations of the complete diffusions-reaction system.},

At 10-3 M magnesium ion greatly reduced the calcite crystallization rate; at 10-5 M it had almost no effect. A parabolic rate law, characteristic of calcite growth in pure solution, holds true for solutions containing magnesium ion. Calcite growth-rate reduction in the presence of magnesium ion results from a decrease in the crystal growth-rate constant and follows a Langmuir adsorption model, suggesting that the magnesium ion is adsorbed at growth sites on the crystal surface. Seed-crystal growth morphology, solution mass balance and ion-activity product values during calcite crystallization indicate that formation of a distinct magnesium-rich phase is not a significant factor in growth inhibition at solution magnesium concentrations less than 2×10-4 M.},

abstract = {We analysed the morphology of Emiliania huxleyi from globally distributed plankton samples and demonstrate that the size of E. huxleyi placoliths is highly correlated to in-situ sea surface water salinity. We used multiple linear regression analysis to link morphological parameters of E. huxleyi to in-situ salinity and in-situ temperature. The best multiple regression model yielded an R2 = 0.84 with a standard residual error of 0.65 for in-situ salinity over a gradient from 32.6 to 38.8. No significant correlation existed with temperature. Our results suggest that the morphology of E. huxleyi placoliths of recent and ancient sediments may provide a robust method to reconstruct sea surface salinities. One caveat is that the plankton-derived multiple regression model for in-situ salinities is different from that reported from previous work on Holocene sediments. This discrepancy is most likely caused by taphonomic processes or from the biogeographically biased data sets which were used (open ocean versus near shore). The cause of the tight relation between salinity and morphological response is not well understood but may be related to cell turgor regulation that affects the size of the cell and thus the size of a single coccolith. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We used published experimental determinations of the calcite specific backscattering and its spectral dependence, and assumed that the absorption coefficient of the medium was that of pure water, to estimate the marine contribution to the SeaWiFS radiance. The aerosol (and Rayleigh‐aerosol interaction) contribution to the radiance was modeled as an exponential function of wavelength. These allow derivation of the coccolith concentration on a pixel‐by‐pixel basis from SeaWiFS imagery. Application to a July 30, 1999 SeaWiFS image of a bloom south of Plymouth, UK indicates that the SeaWiFS estimates are in good agreement with surface measurements of coccolith concentration.},

abstract = {1. Comparisons among animal pollinators of the spatial distributions of pollen that they produce have typically been made among morphologically disparate pairs of species. In contrast, we investigated the potential extent of pollen dispersal by honey-bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble-bees (Bombus lapidarius, B. pascuorum and B. terrestris) foraging in rows of oil-seed rape (Brassica napus cv Westar). 2. We estimated the pollen carryover attributable to individual bees by using particulate fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Most of the dye was deposited at the first few flowers probed and smaller proportions were deposited up to the 20th successively probed flower. We found no significant interspecific differences in dye carryover mediated by individuals of A. mellifera, B. lapidarius and B. terrestris with respect to either the amount deposited or the rate of decline in deposition across successively probed flowers. We present evidence that the dye produced a reasonably good analogue of pollen transfer. 3. Bees typically flew from one plant to another nearby in the same row and were strongly directional in their movements. Bee species differed significantly in their movement patterns, with B. terrestris having the greatest mean move length and directionality. 4. We used three kinds of model (a numerical simulation and two different sets of diffusion-advection equations) to attempt to emulate bee movements. The predictions from all models were reasonably consistent with the observed bee movements, although the numerical simulation invariably made the most accurate predictions, particularly over the first few moves. 5. Predicted bee movements were combined with least-squares models of dye deposition to estimate the spatial dispersal of pollen by each bee species. All models ranked the bees in the same order of decreasing effectiveness in dye dispersal: B. terrestris, A. mellifera, B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum, although, except for long-distance dispersal, there was only minor variation among the bee species in the predicted extents of dye dispersal (e.g. the models predicted that the median dispersal distance would be approximately two intervening plants irrespective of the species of bee). Overall, the consensus of the models' predictions is that most of the pollen from a source plant is deposited on immediate neighbours, but that long-distance pollen dispersal in this system extends over approximately 20-40 intervening plants from the originating plant, depending on the identity of the pollinator.},

abstract = {This study links classical crystal growth theory with observations of microscopic surface processes to quantify the dependence of calcite growth on supersaturation, ??, and show relationships to the same dependencies often approximated by affinity based expressions. In situ Atomic Force Microscopy was used to quantify calcite growth rates and observe transitions in growth processes on {\{}1014{\}} faces in characterized solutions with variable ??. When ?? {\textless} 0.8, growth occurs by step flow at surface defects, including screw dislocations. As ?? exceeds 0.8, two-dimensional surface nucleation becomes increasingly important. The single sourced, single spirals that are produced at lower ?? were examined to measure rates of step flow and the slopes of growth hillocks. These data were used to obtain the surface-normal growth rate, R(m), by the pure spiral mechanism. The dependence of overall growth rate upon dislocation source structure was analyzed using the fundamentals of crystal growth theory. The resulting surface process-based rate expressions for spiral growth show the relationships between R(m) and the distribution and structures of dislocation sources. These theoretical relations are upheld by the process-based experimental rate data reported in this study. The analysis further shows that the dependence of growth rate on dislocation source structures is essential for properly representing growth. This is because most growth sources exhibit complex structures with multiple dislocations. The expressions resulting from this analysis were compared to affinity-based rate equations to show where popular affinity-based rate laws hold or break down. Results of this study demonstrate that the widely used second order chemical affinity-based rate laws are physically meaningful only under special conditions. The exponent in affinity-based expressions is dependent upon the supersaturation range used to fit data. An apparent second order dependence is achieved when solution supersaturations are very near equilibrium and growth occurs only by simple, single sourced dislocation spirals. These findings indicate the need to apply caution when deducing growth mechanisms and rate laws from temporal changes in bulk solution chemistry. Observations of various types of surface defects that give rise to step formation suggest that popular 'rate laws' are sample-dependent composites of rate contributions from each dislocation structure.

Progress has also been made in clarifying the relation between path integration and other navigational strategies. On unfamiliar ground, path integration is the only available means of navigation. In familiar surroundings, however, guidance by landmarks may override guidance by path integration. Path integration then becomes a back-up strategy that is used primarily when landmarks fail.},

@article{Capone1988,
abstract = {The mocrobiota of freshwater and marine sediments serve similar roles in carbon degradation and nutrient regeneration. However, because of differences in the chemical environment between freshwater and marine systems, distinct physiological groups of bacteria dominate terminal carbon catabolism in each system. In general, the distribution and rates of microbial activities within a sediment are determined by availability of electron acceptors for respiration and metabolizable organic substrates. Sulfate ion is a primary factor in the distribution of microbial activities in anoxic sediments. At the high sulfate concentration found in seawater, sulfate reduction exceeds methanogenesis and is responsible for most of the organic carbon oxidation. The importance of methanogenesis in sediment metabolism increases as salinity and, hence, sulfate decreases. In freshwaters, methanogenesis is responsible for the bulk of terminal metabolism under anoxic conditions. The higher affinity of sulfate reducers for substrates that can be used by both groups (e.g. hydrogen, acetate, methanol), as well as the more favorable thermodynamic energy yields of sulfate respiration compared to methanogenesis, may account for the dominance of sulfate respiration under sulfate replete conditions. The sources of organic matter to marine and freshwater sediments can be qualitatively different. Complex structural polysaccharides and phenolic polymers (i.e. ligno-cellulose) may comprise a greater fraction of the organic input to freshwater systems. Organic compounds that act as osmoregulatory solutes in marine plants and animals may be unique substrates for bacteria of marine sediments. It is likely that these differences also result in distinct assemblages of microorganisms responsible for the breakdown of organic carbon. The quantity of organic matter present in the sediments is also a major factor determining the magnitude and distribution of various microbial activities. Near the extremes of high and low organic loading, organic matter input may play a greater role than sulfate concentration in determining the relative importance of sulfate reduction or methanogenesis. In marine systems, methanogenesis occurs in the presence of sulfate ion, but only at the expense of substrates not utilized by sulfate reducers ("noncompetitive" substrates), such as methylamines and, possibly, methylated reduced sulfur compounds. Methanogenesis from noncompetitive substrates represents only a small fraction of the sulfate reduction or carbon catabolism observed in marine sediments. In marine systems with very high rates of organic matter deposition, sulfate can be depleted to the extent that methanogenesis takes on quantitative significance. Although sulfate concentrations are usually insufficient to permit much sulfate reduction in lacustrine environments, in lakes with relatively low organic deposition, sulfate concentrations in the water (and that supplied to the sediments) can be sufficient to allow for a more significant contribution of sulfate respiration to carbon catabolism.},

@article{Burton1951,
abstract = {Parts I and II deal with the theory of crystal growth, parts III and IV with the form (on the atomic scale) of a crystal surface in equilibrium with the vapour. In part I we calculate the rate of advance of monomolecular steps (i.e. the edges of incomplete monomolecular layers of the crystal) as a function of supersaturation in the vapour and the mean concentration of kinks in the steps. We show that in most cases of growth from the vapour the rate of advance of steps will be independent of their crystallographic orientation, so that a growing closed step will be circular. We also find the rate of advance for parallel sequences of steps, and the dependence of rate of advance upon the curvature of the step. In part II we find the resulting rate of growth and the steepness of the growth cones or growth pyramids when the persistence of steps is due to the presence of dislocations. The cases in which several or many dislocations are involved are analysed in some detail; it is shown that they will commonly differ little from the case of a single dislocation. The rate of growth of a surface containing dislocations is shown to be proportional to the square of the supersaturation for low values and to the first power for high values of the latter. Volmer {\&} Schultze's (1931) observations on the rate of growth of iodine crystals from the vapour can be explained in this way. The application of the same ideas to growth of crystals from solution is briefly discussed. Part III deals with the equilibrium structure of steps, especially the statistics of kinks in steps, as dependent on temperature, binding energy parameters, and crystallographic orientation. The shape and size of a two-dimensional nucleus (i.e. an 'island' of new monolayer of crystal on a completed layer) in unstable equilibrium with a given supersaturation at a given temperature is obtained, whence a corrected activation energy for two-dimensional nucleation is evaluated. At moderately low supersaturations this is so large that a perfect crystal would have no observable growth rate. For a crystal face containing two screw dislocations of opposite sense, joined by a step, the activation energy is still very large when their distance apart is less than the diameter of the corresponding critical nucleus; but for any greater separation it is zero. Part IV treats as a 'co-operative phenomenon' the temperature dependence of the structure of the surface of a perfect crystal, free from steps at absolute zero. It is shown that such a surface remains practically flat (save for single adsorbed molecules and vacant surface sites) until a transition temperature is reached, at which the roughness of the surface increases very rapidly ('surface melting'). Assuming that the molecules in the surface are all in one or other of two levels, the results of Onsager (1944) for two-dimensional ferromagnets can be applied with little change. The transition temperature is of the order of, or higher than, the melting-point for crystal faces with nearest neighbour interactions in both directions (e.g. (100) faces of simple cubic or (111) or (100) faces of face-centred cubic crystals). When the interactions are of second nearest neighbour type in one direction (e.g. (110) faces of s.c. or f.c.c. crystals), the transition temperature is lower and corresponds to a surface melting of second nearest neighbour bonds. The error introduced by the assumed restriction to two available levels is investigated by a generalization of Bethe's method (1935) to larger numbers of levels. This method gives an anomalous result for the two-level problem. The calculated transition temperature decreases substantially on going from two to three levels, but remains practically the same for larger numbers.},

This strategy is based on a function that increases the counting time used at each step in the scan in a manner that is inversely proportional to the decline in reflection intensity that inevitably results from the combined effects of Lp factor, scattering factor and thermal vibration. The present work extends the VCT function to include the effects of reflection multiplicity, cylindrical-sample (capillary) absorption and monochromator polarization. The new algorithm has been incorporated into a PC computer program and applied to the collection of data from samples of LaB6, tourmaline, forsterite and boehmite. Subsequent analysis of the data using the Rietveld method has shown that VCT data can produce more accurate atomic coordinates and site occupancies, lower residual 'noise' in difference Fourier maps and more stable refinement of `light' atoms.},

abstract = {[1] We have developed a technique to determine the variability of trace elements (including Li, B, Na, Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn, Sr and Ba) within foraminifera tests using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). This technique has a high spatial resolution (width 40-80 mum, depth {\textgreater} 0.5 mum), is reproducible ({\textless} 8{\%} external reproducibility) and has low detection limits (generally {\textless} 0.05 mug g(-1)). We demonstrate that normalization of data to a calcite standard usually gives results that are more consistent with solution ICP-MS data than normalization to NIST 612. Rastering into the wall of the final chamber of Globigerinoides sacculifer shows that the outermost -1.5 mum of the test is enriched in trace elements, including Mn, relative to the interior, indicating the presence of a contaminant surface phase. Pustule calcite close to the aperture of Globorotalia tumida has different Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca compared to other parts of the test. Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca partition coefficients suggest that the pustule calcite is diagenetic and/or formed in a more open system. Multiple analyses of Orbulina universa tests recovered from a latitudinal transect in the North Atlantic give a relationship between Mg/Ca and sea surface temperature similar to that reported elsewhere in the literature. These initial data demonstrate the validity of this technique, and show that it is potentially an extremely powerful microanalytical tool for palaeoceanographic and palaeontological studies.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} An accurate model for the axial divergence aberration function has been implemented within a fundamental-parameters fitting procedure for diffraction profiles from a conventional X-ray powder diffractometer. The aberration function for axial divergence is derived from the geometrical dimensions of the diffractometer in the axial plane and the angular apertures of any Soller slits in the beam path. This function is then convoluted with other instrument and specimen aberration functions to form the final profile shape. As this process only requires a modest amount of computational effort, it has been incorporated into both a fundamental-parameters profile-analysis fitting program and a Rietveld refinement program. In these programs, the refinable parameters for the axial divergence contribution to the profile shape are the axial X-ray source length, the sample length, the receiving-slit length and the aperture angles of the primary and secondary Soller slits. The procedure developed has been evaluated by fitting diffraction patterns collected using two different X-ray diffractometers and a variety of Soller slits and sample configurations to introduce varying degrees of axial divergence in the incident and diffracted beams. The reference materials used for this work included Y {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} O {\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} , LaB {\textless}sub{\textgreater}6{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} (SRM 660), Cr {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} O {\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} (SRM 674a) and CeO {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} (SRM 674a).

New results provide robust evidence of a 20{\%} decline in seawater 187Os/188Os over a period of about 200 kyr early in magnetochron C29r well below the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary (KPB), confirming previously reported low-resolution data from the South Atlantic Ocean. New results also confirm a second more rapid decline in 187Os/188Os associated with the KPB that is accompanied by a significant increase in Os concentrations. Complementary platinum (Pt) and iridium (Ir) concentration data indicate that the length scale of diagenetic remobilization of platinum group elements from the KPB is less than 1 m and does not obscure the pre-KPB decline in 187Os/188Os. Increases in bulk sediment Ir concentrations and decreases in bulk carbonate content that coincide with the Os isotope shift suggest that carbonate burial flux may have been lower during the initial decline in 187Os/188Os. We speculate that diminished carbonate burial rate may have been the result of ocean acidification caused by Deccan volcanism. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The primary mineralogy of oolites and early marine carbonate cements led Sandberg [Nature 305 (1983), 19-22] to divide the Phanerozoic Eon into three intervals of 'aragonite seas' and two intervals of 'calcite seas'. Hardie [Geology 24 (1996), 279-283] has shown that these oscillations, together with synchronous oscillations in the mineralogy of marine potash evaporites, can be explained by secular shifts in the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater driven by changes in spreading rates along mid-ocean ridges. The Hardie model also predicts that high-Mg calcite should precipitate along with aragonite, as it does in today's aragonite sea. We have uncovered oscillations in the carbonate mineralogy of hypercalcifying organisms (ones that have produced massive skeletons, large reefs, or voluminous bodies of sediment) that correspond to Sandberg's aragonite seas and calcite seas and that are predicted by the Hardie model. Particular groups of corals, sponges, and algae appear to have been dominant reef builders only when favored by an appropriate Mg/Ca ratio in seawater. In early and middle Paleozoic calcite seas (Calcite I), reefs were dominated by calcitic tabulate, heliolitid, and rugose corals and calcitic stromatoporoids. In contrast, during the period of late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic aragonite seas (Aragonite II), aragonitic groups of sponges, scleractinian corals, and phylloid algae, as well as high-Mg calcitic red algae, were principal reef builders. During Late Cretaceous time, at the acme of Calcite II, massive rudists displaced aragonitic hermatypic corals. In today's aragonite sea (Aragonite III) scleractinian corals are again dominant reef builders, along with high-Mg calcitic coralline algae. Major sediment-producing algae exhibit temporal patterns similar to those of reef builders. Calcitic receptaculitids flourished during Calcite I, whereas aragonitic dasycladaceans did not become dominant rock formers until Aragonite II. During Calcite II, calcitic nannoplankton formed massive coccolith chalks in warm shallow seas of the Late Cretaceous, after the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater had reached a very low value and calcium concentration, a very high value. As the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater rose and calcium concentration fell during the Cenozoic Era, individual coccoliths, on average, became less massive and encrusted cells less thickly. By Pliocene time, during Aragonite III, the prominent genus Discoaster secreted only narrow-rayed coccoliths that covered less than 25{\%} of the cell surface. Also during Aragonite III, the aragonitic green alga Halimeda emerged as the dominant skeletal sediment producer in reef tracts. The influence of seawater chemistry on skeletal secretion appears to have been especially strong for morphologically simple taxa that exert relatively weak control over their own calcification. Such groups include algae, sponges, corals, and bryozoans. Morphological simplicity also permits these groups to adopt vegetative or colonial modes of growth that confer success in competition for space on reefs. This linkage, in addition to the basic chemical demands of hypercalcification, has given the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater strong control over the success of individual reef-building taxa. More generally, this ratio appears to have strongly influenced evolutionary changes in the skeletal mineralogy of sponges and cheilostome bryozoans throughout their history. We conclude that throughout Phanerozoic time a chain of causation has extended from mid-ocean ridge processes, via seawater chemistry, to the mineralogical and biological composition of reef communities and bioclastic carbonate deposits.},

abstract = {Culture experiments were used to assess the applicability of Emiliania huxleyi coccolith morphology as a palaeo-sea-surface salinity (SSS) proxy. Coccolith morphology was dependent on salinity over a range reflecting present day marine conditions; both coccolith size and the number of coccolith elements increased linearly with increasing salinity. Using regression analysis, the effect of salinity on coccolith morphology was compared to those previously observed in sediment core-top and plankton data. No significant differences were found between the slopes of these data, suggesting that salinity is the primary control on E. huxleyi coccolith size and element number in the ocean. However, the intercepts of the culture data were significantly higher. A combination of experimental and literature analysis indicated that temperature and nutrients were unlikely to be the causes of this discrepancy. Literature analysis also highlighted that coccolith size data from marginal environments displayed different intercepts to those from the open-ocean data. This suggests that discrete morphotypes exist in these marginal locations. We, therefore, recommend that the original E. huxleyi coccolith morphology palaeo-SSS transfer function requires further evaluation before being routinely applied. {\textcopyright} 2009, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that emission of anthropogenic carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will lead to increased concentrations of CO2 in sea water corresponding to a decrease of pH of several tenths of pH units. An experiment was performed to test the effects of increased sea water concentrations of CO2 on shell growth of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. The experiment was performed in aquaria continuously flushed with sea water spiked with CO2 to provide five different levels of pH between 6.7 and control sea water with a pH of 8.1. The shell length of the mussels was measured at the start and end of the 44 days experimental period. No mortality was observed during the first 23 days of the experiment. The growth increment in mm was much larger for small mussels than for large mussels, but relative growth profile as function of pH was more similar in the two size groups; observed differences may be random variation between samples. The experiments showed that CO2 induced reduction of pH affects the growth of M. edulis negatively. There was a strong and statistically significant decrease in growth at the lowest pH values, with virtually no growth at pH = 6.7 and reduced growth at pH = 7.1. The effect seems to set in between pH 7.4 and 7.1; at mean pH levels 7.4 and 7.6 the growth increments were not significantly different from growth at normal pH 8.1. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Only recently has it become possible to unravel experimentally the processes of Ca–P formation through a cluster-growth model. Here we use mineral replacement reactions by the interaction of phosphate-bearing solutions with calcite surfaces in a fluid cell of an atomic force microscope (AFM) and reveal that the mineral surface-induced formation of an apatitic phase proceeds through the nucleation and aggregation of nanosized clusters with dimensions similar to those of Posner's clusters, which subsequently form stable amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) plates prior to the transformation to the final crystalline phase. Our directAFM observations provide evidence for the existence of stable Posner's clusters even though no organic template is applied.},

abstract = {Manganoan magnesian calcite overgrowths were precipitated from artificial seawater at 25°C on pure calcite seeds using a constant disequilibrium technique. The composition of the overgrowths, and more specifically their Mn, Mg, Na and Sr content, was determined as a function of the precipitation rate and Mn2+ concentration in the parent solution. X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that the overgrowths produced were one-phase multicomponent solid solutions, and contained up to 40 mole{\%} MnCO3. The amount of Mn coprecipitated with calcite decreased with increasing precipitation rate. Thus, overgrowths are not in exchange equilibrium with the solutions from which they precipitated. A kinetic model is proposed which adequately describes the composition of the overgrowths in terms of the relative precipitation rate of an 8-10 mole{\%} magnesian calcite and a "pseudokutnahorite" from seawater. The possible existence of a pseudokutnahorite in marine sediments and its implications are discussed. The concentration of Mg in the overgrowths decreased with increasing MnCO3 content, but their Mg:Ca ratio remained nearly constant. Strontium and Na incorporation was strongly dependent on the number of available nonlattices sites. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {This research demonstrates that it is the distance of fixed-charge separation in the resin which is the primary determinant of divalent/monovalent selectivity. Anion resins, particularly acrylics and epoxies, with closely spaced N-containing (amine) functional groups are inherently divalent-ion selective. This is because the uptake of a divalent anion, e.g. sulfate, requires the presence of two closely-spaced positive charges. Results from this study of 30 commercially-available, strong- and weak-base, anion resins indicate that in order to bring positive charges into close proximity within a resin one can: (1) incorporate the amine functional groups into the polymer chains as opposed to having them pendant on the chains; (2) minimize the size and number of organic ("R") groups attached to the N atom, i.e., minimize the size of the amine; and (3) maximize the resin flexibility, i.e., its ability to reorient to satisfy divalent counterions, by minimizing the degree of crosslinking. The distance-of-charge-separation theory is not restricted to divalent anion exchangers but also applies to cation exchangers and to polyvalent ions in general. ?? 1983.},

Small amounts of hydrothermal water (≤1{\%} of total river discharge) have a significant impact on the solute chemistry and the budget of radiogenic Sr in the Marsyandi. In the upper Marsyandi, river chemistry reflects carbonate weathering, with 87Sr/86Sr ≤ 0.72. As the Marsyandi flows across the dominantly silicate High Himalayan Crystalline terrane, both 87Sr/86Sr and [Sr] increase, associated with increases in the concentration of Na+, K+, and Cl−, all of which are high in the hydrothermal waters. Cation concentrations decrease along the Lesser Himalayan reach of the river. Hot-spring dissolved CO2 has a $\delta$13C value to +5.9‰, indicating that metamorphic decarbonation reactions contribute CO2 to the fluids. Hydrothermal CO2 is partially neutralized in high-temperature weathering reactions, which generate alkalinity and yield abundant radiogenic Sr. Radiogenic hydrothermal carbonate can form from these solutions and later weather, releasing silicate Sr but imparting carbonate characteristics to the overall water chemistry.},

abstract = {Sediments recovered at lower bathyal ODP Site 1049 on Blake Nose (Northwestern Atlantic) offer an opportunity to study environmental changes at the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/P) boundary relatively close to the Chicxulub impact structure on the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. In Hole 1049C, the boundary is located at the base of a 9-cm-thick layer with abundant spherules, considered to be impact ejecta. Uppermost Maastrichtian oozes below, and lowermost Danian pelagic oozes above the spherule-bed contain well-preserved bathyal benthic foraminifera. The spherule-bed itself, in contrast, contains a mixture of shallow (neritic) and deeper (bathyal) species, and specimens vary strongly in preservation. This assemblage was probably formed by reworking and down-slope transport triggered by the K/P impact. Across the spherule-bed (i.e., the K/P boundary) only ∼7{\%} of benthic foraminiferal species became extinct, similar to the low extinction rates of benthic foraminifera worldwide. Quantitative analysis of benthic foraminiferal assemblages and morphogroups in the {\textgreater}63-$\mu$m size fraction indicates a relatively eutrophic, stable environment during the latest Maastrichtian, interrupted by a sudden decrease in the food supply to the benthos at the K/P boundary and a decrease in diversity of the faunas, followed by a stepped recovery during the earliest Danian. The recovery was probably linked to the gradual recovery of surface-dwelling primary producers. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Agriculture is estimated to be responsible for 70{\%} of nitrate and 30-50{\%} of phosphorus pollution, contributing to ecological and water treatment problems. Despite the fact that significant gaps remain in our understanding, it is known that agricultural stewardship can be highly effective in controlling water pollution at the plot and field scales. Knowledge at the catchment scale is, to a large extent, entirely lacking though and this is of paramount concern given that the catchment is the management unit used by regulatory authorities. The few studies that have examined the impact of agricultural stewardship at the catchment scale have found that Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) in the UK have resulted in little improvement in water quality which concurs with the current catchment study. In addition to NVZs, there was little evidence to suggest that the England Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative had impacted water quality and suggestions have been made for improvements, such as ensuring that stewardship measures are used in key pollution source areas and their implementation and impacts are monitored more closely. This will be essential if agricultural catchment management schemes are going to provide the benefits expected of them. Nevertheless, more intensive monitoring than that carried out by regulators showed a significant trend in decreasing winter nitrate peaks in some streams which is hypothesised to be due to recent reduced inorganic fertiliser application as a result of increasing prices. It was concluded that, collectively, these findings indicate that agricultural stewardship measures have the potential to improve water quality at the catchment scale but that voluntary schemes with insufficient financial reward or regulatory pressure are unlikely to be successful. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Self-structuring in marine sediment communities is achieved by the mobility of the organisms, the trophic web, and biogenic transformations of the habitat. The latter are: bioconstruction and bioturbations, sediment stabilisation and destabilisation, with facilitating and inhibiting effects. This cursory overview intends to show that in near-shore mud and sand, biogenic habitat transformations pervade all community interactions. Consequently these deserve as much attention in benthic ecosystem analyses as do trophic pathways. Abundant phototrophs and suspension feeders tend to accumulate sediment and organic matter. Underneath phototrophic mats, composite layers of anaerobic microorganisms abound. Benthic animals provide anchorage to tufts of algae, and these in turn provide shelter and food for mobile benthos. Rooted plants slow down hydrodynamics and generate complex habitats above the sediment surface but below a meshwork of roots may inhibit burrowing animals. Abundant suspension feeders stabilise sediments, and may build loose hummocks, multi-species epibenthic thickets or solid reefs, accommodating diverse epibenthic assemblages. Their raised and rough surfaces enhance turbulence. Below the sediment surface, tubes and burrows of sessile or discretely motile animals provide microoxic habitats for diverse assemblages of small organisms. At the surface, mucus of motile organisms increases sediment cohesion. Accumulated dead hardparts of the benthos support epibionts when at the surface but cause resistance to the burrowers below. Reworking and irrigation of the sediment by the infauna increases oxygenation, and particulate and solute fluxes with the overlying water. Mounds and pits generated by resident burrowers as well as by large visiting grazers and predators further diversify the benthos. All these bioengineered structures and processes generate dynamic and complex habitat-mediated interaction webs, affecting and meshed into the trophic web, which they may rival in overall importance in the self-structuring of the benthos in coastal marine sediments. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Long-term changes in the plankton of the North Sea are investigated using data from the continuous plankton recorder (CPR) survey. During the last 4 decades, there appears to have been 2 large anomalous periods within the plankton data set, one that occurred in the late 1970s and the other in the late 1980s. These anomalous periods seem to be largely synchronous with unusual ocean climate conditions that have occurred episodically over a timescale of decades. The unusual ocean climate conditions prevailing at these 2 time periods appear to contain important hydrographical elements that involve oceanic incursions into the North Sea. This paper, using data from the CPR survey and providing evidence from other studies, focuses on the relationship between the long-term changes in the biology of the North Sea and these 2 exceptional hydro-climatic events. Here, we suggest that while atmospheric variability and associated changes in regional temperatures have a dominant effect on the marine environment, oceanic influences on the ecology of a semi-closed environment such as the North Sea may have been underestimated in the past.},

abstract = {This paper presents multi-species records of the Li/Ca ratio and Li isotopic composition ($\delta$7Li) of planktonic foraminifera from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans for the past 18 Ma. The Li/Ca record is corrected for interspecific offsets determined from recent (Holocene) foraminifera; interspecific offsets in $\delta$7Li are not significant. Despite different diagenetic histories, the records produced from both oceans are remarkably consistent. Corrected planktonic foraminiferal Li/Ca ratios range from 6.3 to 10.9 $\mu$mol/mol, while planktonic foraminiferal $\delta$7Li ranges from 25 to 31‰. Both records are interpreted in terms of long-term changes in seawater Li/Ca and $\delta$7Li, enabling issues related to higher-resolution variability in Li/Ca and $\delta$7Li to be ignored. By assuming that the hydrothermal flux of Li into the oceans, and the flux of Li removed from the oceans during low-temperature uptake by marine basalts and sediments, have not changed significantly since 18 Ma, and using published records for the seawater calcium concentration, the seawater Li/Ca and $\delta$7Li records can be used to estimate global average river $\delta$7Li and Li fluxes. Our records indicate that the river flux of dissolved Li decreased between 16 and ∼8 Ma while the $\delta$7Li value of the river input increased. These data imply that both silicate weathering rates and weathering intensity decreased over this interval which may have been responsible for putative increases in levels of atmospheric CO2. In contrast, the riverine flux of Li has increased since ∼8 Ma while its $\delta$7Li value has increased. This implies that the silicate weathering rate has increased, while weathering intensity has decreased, since that time. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The surface of a crystal in equilibrium with solute-bearing fluid generally has a composition that differs from that of the bulk crystal. If the crystal is growing, the surface composition may be "captured" by the newly formed lattice to a degree that depends upon the growth rate and the mobility of atoms in the near-surface region: rapid growth promotes this growth "entrapment," high near-surface mobility works against it. Natural calcites may be particularly susceptible to this kind of kinetic disequilibrium, because their precipitation rates from aqueous solution can be relatively high even at near-ambient temperatures, where ion mobility in the critical near-surface region may be limited. Existing laboratory data on trace-element uptake as a function of calcite growth rate are examined here in the context of recent discoveries concerning the structure, chemistry and kinetics of the near-surface region of calcite crystals. Recent demonstrations that ions can be mobile in the outermost few nanometers of the calcite lattice even at room temperature have the greatest potential to affect growth entrapment. The model of Watson and Liang (1995)-which quantifies entrapment efficiency in terms of growth rate, diffusivity and surface-layer thickness-is modified to include a depth-dependent diffusivity and possible depletion (as well as enrichment) of some elements in the near-surface region. With these changes, the model is shown to be qualitatively consistent with the body of experimental data on trace element uptake during calcite precipitation.This apparent success of the model invites application to stable isotopes. Constraining data are few, but available information on oxygen isotope fractionation can be used to show that growth entrapment at ambient temperatures may (depending on model assumptions) produce deviations from calcite/H 2O equilibrium of up to several ???. The preferred choice of 18O/ 16O for the surface layer is lighter than the lattice equilibrium value, and leads to a reduction in 18O/ 16O of crystals grown at higher growth rates, mimicking "vital effects." ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The merging of two independent populations of heterotrophs and autotrophs into a single population of mixotrophs has occurred frequently in evolutionary history. It is an example of a wide class of related phenomena, known as symbiogenesis. The physiological basis is almost always (reciprocal) syntrophy, where each species uses the products of the other species. Symbiogenesis can repeat itself after specialization on particular assimilatory substrates. We discuss quantitative aspects and delineate eight steps from two free-living interacting populations to a single fully integrated endosymbiotic one. The whole process of gradual interlocking of the two populations could be mimicked by incremental changes of particular parameter values. The role of products gradually changes from an ecological to a physiological one. We found conditions where the free-living, epibiotic and endobiotic populations of symbionts can co-exist, as well as conditions where the endobiotic symbionts outcompete other symbionts. Our population dynamical analyses give new insights into the evolution of cellular homeostasis. We show how structural biomass with a constant chemical composition can evolve in a chemically varying environment if the parameters for the formation of products satisfy simple constraints. No additional regulation mechanisms are required for homeostasis within the context of the dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory for the uptake and use of substrates by organisms. The DEB model appears to be dosed under endosymbiosis. This means that when each free-living partner follows DEB rules for substrate uptake and use, and they become engaged in an endosymbiotic relationship, a gradual transition to a single fully integrated system is possible that again follows DEB rules for substrate uptake and use.},

@article{Hales2003,
abstract = {Here I synthesize the results of several types of measurements of organic carbon respiration and calcium carbonate dissolution rates in pelagic seafloor sediments. Measurements of pore water oxygen demonstrate that most of the respiration takes place very near the sediment-water interface, with a scale depth of a few millimeters. The remainder of the oxic respiration occurs much deeper in the sediments, with a scale depth of several centimeters. All measures of respiration from locations as disparate as the tropical Pacific and Atlantic, and the subtropical North Atlantic agree that pelagic seafloor rates of oxic respiration of organic carbon are relatively independent of depth and location, with the exception of sediments beneath the Pacific eastern equatorial upwelling zone. Calcite dissolution in seafloor sediments requires forcing by respiration-produced CO2, and rates are consistent with a first-order dependence on pore water undersaturation, solubility as determined by Mucci [1983] at atmospheric pressure, and locally variable mass-specific dissolution rate constants. Respiration-driven calcite dissolution fluxes predicted by this combination of respiration and dissolution rate expressions are significantly lower than many previous estimates. Comparison of dissolution fluxes in the oligotrophic open ocean measured by other researchers with benthic chamber incubation techniques with those predicted by this combination of rate expressions is, within stated uncertainties, in agreement in all but one case, questioning the need for complicated mechanisms such as surface buffering or authigenic precipitation to explain seafloor calcite diagenesis. Applying these kinetics to a simple one-dimensional, steady state model of the bulk calcite content and sediment accumulation rates of the sediment mixed layer yields results consistent with observations of the seafloor lysocline, the region of transition from high calcite to low-calcite sediments, on the Ceara Rise in the western tropical North Atlantic and the Ontong-Java Plateau in the western equatorial Pacific. Scenarios ignoring dissolution driven by respiration-produced CO2 in pore waters and using the high-order dependence on undersaturation and very large dissolution rate constants implied by some earlier laboratory studies do not simulate these observations. While the scheme represented here does, in fact, imply a strong shift in the locus of carbonate dissolution toward the sediment water interface as bottom-water saturation decreases, as implied by the observations of Martin et al. [2000], no simple combination of sediment transport coefficients and reaction kinetics can reproduce the observation of increasing 14C age as dissolution progresses. These results emphasize the importance of accurate knowledge of the kinetics of respiration and dissolution to interpretation of either the present-day or paleolysocline.},

abstract = {The answer to the title question is uncertain, as very few manipulative experiments have been conducted to test how deep-sea scleractinians (stony corals) react to changes in seawater chemistry. Ocean pH and calcium carbonate saturation are decreasing due to an influx of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere. Experimental evidence has shown that declining carbonate saturation inhibits the ability of marine organisms to build calcium carbonate skeletons, shells, and tests. Here we put forward a hypothesis suggesting that the global distribution of deep-sea scleractinian corals could be limited in part by the depth of the aragonite saturation horizon (ASH) in the world's oceans. Aragonite is the metastable form of calcium carbonate used by scleractinian corals to build their skeletons and the ASH is the limit between saturated and undersaturated water. The hypothesis is tested by reviewing the distribution of deep-sea, bioherm-forming scleractinian corals with respect to the depth of the ASH. Results indicate that {\textgreater} 95{\%} of 410 coral locations occurred in saturated waters during pre-industrial times. Projections indicate that about 70{\%} of these locations will be in undersaturated waters by 2099. Lab experimentation, in situ experimentation, and monitoring efforts are needed to quantify the effects of changing seawater chemistry on deep-sea coral ecosystems.},

abstract = {Calcium carbonate minerals are an integral part of many organisms. These biogenic minerals are all of original size, shape and high strength, and they are quite different from those found in their abiotic precipitates. It has been accepted that the formation, morphological development and crystallography of the biocomposites are controlled by the intrinsic molecular recognition of macromolecules. In this study, with the analyses of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy of the texture of biogenic minerals in oyster shells, we noted that the intracrystalline proteins deliberately reduce the coherence lengths of biogenic crystals compared to synthetic ones, leading to more isotropy. In order to understand the exact nature of the controlled nucleation and growth, we investigated the changes in protein conformation in vivo from the mineral-specific layers using Fourier self-deconvolution and Gaussian curve-fitting techniques. And via in vitro assays, we studied the relation of such changes to biomineral phase and morphology. We showed that the shell proteins in vivo are in the higher structural ordered state, and ??-antiparallel structure was predominant in each shell layer. Also, as the shell undergoes a change of calcium carbonate polymorphs from aragonite to calcite, significant alterations of the protein conformation with the denaturing of ??-helix and ??-structure in the aragonitic layer is induced. These results provide a relationship between the effects of conformational changes on the nanostructure of biocomposites and the necessity of new synthetic strategies.},

abstract = {Present-day production of CaCO3 in tne world ocean is calculated to be about 5 billion tons (bt) per year, of which about 3 bt accumulate in sediments; the other 40{\%} is dissolved. Nearly half of the carbonate sediment accumulates on reefs, banks, and tropical shelves, and consists largely of metastable aragonite and magnesian calcite. Deep-sea carbonates, predominantly calcitic coccoliths and planktonic foraminifera, have orders of magnitude lower productivity and accumulation rates than shallow-water carbonates, but they cover orders of magnitude larger basin area. Twice as much calcium is removed from the oceans by present-day carbonate accumulation as is estimated to be brought in by rivers and hydrothermal activity (1.6 bt), suggesting that outputs have been overestimated or inputs underestimated, that one or more other inputs have not been identified, and/or that the oceans are not presently in steady state. One “missing” calcium source might be groundwater, although its present-day input is probably much smaller than that of rivers. If, as seems likely, CaCO3 accumulation presently exceeds terrestial and hydrothermal input, this imbalance presumably is offset by decreased accumulation and increased input during lowered sea level: shallow-water accumulation decreases by an order of magnitude with a 100 m drop in sea level, while groundwater influx increases because of heightened piezometric head and the diagenesis of metastable aragonite and magnesian calcite from subaerially exposed shallow-water carbonates.},

Both approaches have inherent flaws: and data that once seemed reliable can be readily superseded by the discovery of new fossils and/or the application of new analytical techniques. Herein the current state of the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) biostratigraphical record is reviewed for most major fossil clades, including: calcareous nannoplankton, dinoflagellates, diatoms, radiolaria, foraminifera, ostracodes, scleractinian corals, bryozoans, brachiopods, molluscs, echinoderms, fish, amphibians, reptiles and terrestrial plants (macrofossils and palynomorphs). These reviews take account of possible biasing factors in the fossil record in order to extract the most comprehensive picture of the R-T biotic crisis available. Results suggest that many faunal and floral groups (ostracodes, bryozoa, ammonite cephalopods, bivalves, archosaurs) were in decline throughout the latest Maastrichtian while others (diatoms, radiolaria, benthic foraminifera, brachiopods, gastropods, fish, amphibians, lepidosaurs, terrestrial plants) passed through the K-T event horizon with only minor taxonomic richness and/or diversity changes. A few microfossil groups (calcareous nannoplankton, dinoflagellates, planktonic foraminifera) did experience a turnover of varying magnitudes in the latest Maastrichtian-earliest Danian. However, many of these turnovers, along with changes in ecological dominance patterns among benthic foraminifera, began in the latest Maastrichtian.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} An accurate model for the axial divergence aberration function has been implemented within a fundamental-parameters fitting procedure for diffraction profiles from a conventional X-ray powder diffractometer. The aberration function for axial divergence is derived from the geometrical dimensions of the diffractometer in the axial plane and the angular apertures of any Soller slits in the beam path. This function is then convoluted with other instrument and specimen aberration functions to form the final profile shape. As this process only requires a modest amount of computational effort, it has been incorporated into both a fundamental-parameters profile-analysis fitting program and a Rietveld refinement program. In these programs, the refinable parameters for the axial divergence contribution to the profile shape are the axial X-ray source length, the sample length, the receiving-slit length and the aperture angles of the primary and secondary Soller slits. The procedure developed has been evaluated by fitting diffraction patterns collected using two different X-ray diffractometers and a variety of Soller slits and sample configurations to introduce varying degrees of axial divergence in the incident and diffracted beams.

abstract = {We established the relationships between water chemistry changes in a pool fed by a permanent spring and seasonal variations in trace-element contents (Sr {\&} Mg) in the shells of the ostracod species Herpetocypris intermedia, based on monthly collections of ostracod and water samples. The water chemistry of the investigated pool (Maiques, Valencia, Spain) was dominated by calcium and bicarbonate, and showed marked seasonal variation in alkalinity, Ca2+ content, Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios. Although the variability in the water chemistry was relatively low (similar to 10{\%} relative standard deviation over the entire period), the trace-clement contents: in the ostracod shells tracked the seasonal change in the water chemistry of Maiques pool. Moreover, due to the rapid renewal of H. intermedia population, this species is able to record in its shells the evolution of the water chemistry at a monthly time scale. Our results also showed that, in the Maiques pool system, ostracod Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios increased with the decrease in water salinity. To our knowledge, this is the first geochemical study of ostracods dwelling in spring environments. The results of this study may be applied to paleohydrological reconstruction using ostracods preserved in sediments deposited around springs (i.e., travertine and tufa deposits).},

abstract = {We present large subunit (LSU) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA based phylogenies of symbiotic dinoflagellates retrieved from single-cell planktonic foraminifera collected around the world. All modern foraminiferal species involved in such symbiosis are included in our analyses. The pelagic symbiotic dinoflagellates form a monophyletic group sister to the Symbiodinium species complex found in coastal-benthic environments. The pelagic symbionts are descendants of free-living species and, together with the coastal-benthic Symbiodinium spp., they originated from the early Mesozoic suessiacean family represented by the extant Polarella glacialis. Out of hundreds of single planktonic foraminifera examined, 21 unique pelagic symbiont ribotypes were recognized, which could be divided into 2 main clades and 4 genetic subgroups. We observed an absence of specificity between the symbiont genetic types and the host genetic and morphological species. A few foraminifera even harbored dinoflagellates of more than one genetic subgroup. This genetic flexibility may be constrained by the fast life cycles of pelagic single-cell hosts, which acquire symbionts de novo from the ambient water at each generation. The obligatory transitional free-living stage of pelagic symbionts prior to acquisition by foraminiferal hosts may also explain their significantly lower rates of DNA substitution in comparison to their coastal-benthic relatives. We propose that the open ocean ecosystem has maintained photosymbioses involving a relatively low genetic diversity, but an extreme flexibility in the relationships between both partners, which also preserved their ancestral ability for independent life.},

abstract = {We present new density records from sediment cores taken along a depth transect in Lake Chichancanab, Mexico. The data reveal in great detail the climatic events that comprised the Terminal Classic Drought (TCD) and coincided with the demise of Classic Maya civilization between ca 750 and 1050 AD. In shallow-water cores, the TCD is marked by a condensed gypsum horizon. In deeper-water sections it is expanded and represented by numerous interbedded gypsum and organic-rich strata. The TCD was not a single, two-century-long megadrought, but rather consisted of a series of dry events separated by intervening periods of relatively moister conditions. We estimate the TCD occurred between ca 770 and 1100 AD and included an early phase (ca 770-870 AD) and late phase (ca 920-1100 AD). The intervening 50-year period (ca 870-920 AD) was relatively moister. Each dry phase is represented by multiple gypsum (density) bands interbedded with organic-rich sediment that indicate alternating dry and wet conditions. Spectral analysis revealed significant periods around 213, 50, and 27 years. Despite uncertainty regarding the ages of these events, their pattern is robust and generally consistent with other proxy records under the same climate regime, such as the marine Cariaco Basin off northern Venezuela (Science 299 (2003) 1731). ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Many flowering plants have adopted self-incompatibility mechanisms to prevent inbreeding and promote out-crosses. In the Solanaceae, Rosaceae and Scrophulariaceae, two separate genes at the highly polymorphic S-locus control self-incompatibility interactions: the S-RNase gene encodes the pistil determinant and the previously unidentified S-gene encodes the pollen determinant. S-RNases interact with pollen S-allele products to inhibit the growth of self-pollen tubes in the style. Pollen-expressed F-box genes showing allelic sequence polymorphism have recently been identified near to the S-RNase gene in members of the Rosaceae and Scrophulariaceae; but until now have not been directly shown to encode the pollen determinant. Here we report the identification and characterization of PiSLF, an S-locus F-box gene of Petunia inflata (Solanaceae). We show that transformation of S1S1, S1S2 and S2S3 plants with the S2-allele of PiSLF causes breakdown of their pollen function in self-incompatibility. This breakdown of pollen function is consistent with 'competitive interaction', in which pollen carrying two different pollen S-alleles fails to function in self-incompatibility. We conclude that PiSLF encodes the pollen self-incompatibility determinant.},

abstract = {The trace metal composition of foraminiferal shells preserved in deep-sea sediments is a critical source of data used in reconstructing the physical and chemical characteristics of ancient oceans. However, paleoceanographic information derived from these tracers is limited by the accuracy with which calcite shells record ambient seawater chemistry and the question of whether changing environmental conditions or interspecific differences affect shell chemistry. Experiments with living foraminifera are one of the most direct ways to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between shell and seawater chemistry and the influence, if any, of environmental variables. Here we present results from laboratory experiments on the living planktonic foraminifers Globigerina sacculifer and Orbulina universa that demonstrate that precipitated shells provide an accurate record of seawater barium, a tracer used in reconstructing nutrient and alkalinity distributions in past oceans. On the basis of culturing data at 29{\o}C, 36.7{\%}0 salinity, the best estimate of the partition coefficient D relating foraminifera shell Ba/Ca to seawater Ba/Ca is 0.147 + 0.004. Data show that when environmental conditions are held constant, there is no significant variability in Ba uptake between individual shells of one or both species. Results also demonstrate that temperature varying over a 7{\o}C range and salinity varying over a 3{\%}0 range do not appreciably influence Ba uptak},

abstract = {Variations in the strength of the North Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation have been linked to rapid climate changes during the last glacial cycle through oscillations in North Atlantic Deep Water formation and northward oceanic heat flux. The strength of the thermohaline circulation depends on the supply of warm, salty water to the North Atlantic, which, after losing heat to the atmosphere, produces the dense water masses that sink to great depths and circulate back south. Here we analyse two Caribbean Sea sediment cores, combining Mg/Ca palaeothermometry with measurements of oxygen isotopes in foraminiferal calcite in order to reconstruct tropical Atlantic surface salinity during the last glacial cycle. We find that Caribbean salinity oscillated between saltier conditions during the cold oxygen isotope stages 2, 4 and 6, and lower salinities during the warm stages 3 and 5, covarying with the strength of North Atlantic Deep Water formation. At the initiation of the B{\o}lling/Aller{\o}d warm interval, Caribbean surface salinity decreased abruptly, suggesting that the advection of salty tropical waters into the North Atlantic amplified thermohaline circulation and contributed to high-latitude warming.},

abstract = {Infrared spectrometry is a well-established method for the identification of minerals. Due to its simplicity and the short time required to obtain a result, it can be practiced on-site during excavation using portable infrared spectrometers. However, the identification of a mineral may not be sufficient. For example, a lime plaster floor and a crushed chalk surface have a similar appearance and are composed of the same mineral - calcite. Here we exploit differences in the infrared spectra of geogenic, biogenic and pyrogenic calcites for the identification of each calcite type. The infrared calcite spectrum has three characteristic peaks in the region of 400-4000 cm-1, designated ??2, ??3, and ??4. When a calcite sample is ground, as part of the measurement preparation procedure, some grinding dependent changes will be revealed in the infrared spectrum. With additional grinding, the ??3 peak narrows and the heights of the ??2 and ??4 peaks decrease, when both are normalized to the ??3 height. By plotting the normalized heights of the ??2 versus the ??4 of several grindings of the same sample, a characteristic trend line is formed for each calcite type. The trend lines of geogenic calcites have the shallowest slopes and highest ??4 values when compared to pyrogenic calcites, which can be further divided to ash and plaster/mortar samples. This method can assist in distinguishing between the various calcites, and provide insights into homogeneity and preservation state of the calcitic materials in question. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Biological organisms possess an unparalleled ability to control the structure and properties of mineralized tissues. They are able, for example, to guide the formation of smoothly curving single crystals or tough, lightweight, self-repairing skeletal elements. In many biominerals, an organic matrix interacts with the mineral as it forms, controls its morphology and polymorph, and is occluded during mineralization. The remarkable functional properties of the resulting composites-such as outstanding fracture toughness and wear resistance-can be attributed to buried organic-inorganic interfaces at multiple hierarchical levels. Analysing and controlling such interfaces at the nanometre length scale is critical also in emerging organic electronic and photovoltaic hybrid materials. However, elucidating the structural and chemical complexity of buried organic-inorganic interfaces presents a challenge to state-of-the-art imaging techniques. Here we show that pulsed-laser atom-probe tomography reveals three-dimensional chemical maps of organic fibres with a diameter of 5-10 nm in the surrounding nano-crystalline magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) mineral in the tooth of a marine mollusc, the chiton Chaetopleura apiculata. Remarkably, most fibres co-localize with either sodium or magnesium. Furthermore, clustering of these cations in the fibre indicates a structural level of hierarchy previously undetected. Our results demonstrate that in the chiton tooth, individual organic fibres have different chemical compositions, and therefore probably different functional roles in controlling fibre formation and matrix-mineral interactions. Atom-probe tomography is able to detect this chemical/structural heterogeneity by virtue of its high three-dimensional spatial resolution and sensitivity across the periodic table. We anticipate that the quantitative analysis and visualization of nanometre-scale interfaces by laser-pulsed atom-probe tomography will contribute greatly to our understanding not only of biominerals (such as bone, dentine and enamel), but also of synthetic organic-inorganic composites.},

In this paper, a comprehensive review of the biogeochemical cycling of P within the oceans is given, with particular attention focused on the composition and recycling rates of P within the water column.

abstract = {The Mg/Ca ratio of foraminifera tests is increasingly being utilized as a paleotemperature proxy. Deep time (pre-Pleistocene) Mg/Ca paleothermometry is complicated by the fact that the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater (Mg/Casw) has undergone considerable secular variation over the Cenozoic. Previous studies have corrected for this by assuming an invariant Mg distribution coefficient (DMg) with Mg/Casw. More recent laboratory culturing has shown that this is not the case, demonstrating that a power relationship best describes the variation in test Mg/Ca (Mg/Catest) with Mg/Casw. Therefore, previous corrections are likely to have led to inaccurate temperature reconstructions. Here, we show how the systematics of such a correction should be applied and demonstrate why this provides good evidence that the Mg/Ca ratio of Paleogene seawater was lower than previously implied by foraminiferal constraints, in agreement with the majority of the proxy Mg/Casw evidence. We also demonstrate how it is indirectly possible to constrain the value of H, the power component of a Mg/Catest{\&}{\#}8211;Mg/Casw calibration, potentially enabling the appropriate correction of results derived from species where this relationship has not been calibrated. However, this technique should not be treated as a substitute for culturing. The previous erroneous assumptions regarding both (1) the relationship between Mg/Catest and Mg/Casw and (2) the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater at a given time in the past may counteract each other to differing extents. As a result, previous absolute pre-Pleistocene paleotemperature estimates derived from Mg/Ca ratios in foraminifera should be treated with caution, although relative temperature changes over short ({\textless}1 Ma timescales) are likely to be reliable.},

abstract = {Sea urchin teeth are remarkable and complex calcite structures, continuously growing at the forming end and self-sharpening at the mature grinding tip. The calcite (CaCO(3)) crystals of tooth components, plates, fibers, and a high-Mg polycrystalline matrix, have highly co-oriented crystallographic axes. This ability to co-orient calcite in a mineralized structure is shared by all echinoderms. However, the physico-chemical mechanism by which calcite crystals become co-oriented in echinoderms remains enigmatic. Here, we show differences in calcite c-axis orientations in the tooth of the purple sea urchin ( Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ), using high-resolution X-ray photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy (X-PEEM) and microbeam X-ray diffraction (muXRD). All plates share one crystal orientation, propagated through pillar bridges, while fibers and polycrystalline matrix share another orientation. Furthermore, in the forming end of the tooth, we observe that CaCO(3) is present as amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). We demonstrate that co-orientation of the nanoparticles in the polycrystalline matrix occurs via solid-state secondary nucleation, propagating out from the previously formed fibers and plates, into the amorphous precursor nanoparticles. Because amorphous precursors were observed in diverse biominerals, solid-state secondary nucleation is likely to be a general mechanism for the co-orientation of biomineral components in organisms from different phyla.},

                        11B MAS NMR analysis and FITEQL modeling of B sorption on HA showed that this element forms tetrahedrally coordinated five- or six-membered ring chelates, most likely 1,2-diol and 1,3-diol complexes at alkaline pH (8 {\textless} pH {\textless} 11) and dicarboxylic complexes at near neutral conditions (6 {\textless} pH {\textless} 9). Results of this study demonstrate for the first time that boron sorption on HA induces a strong pH-dependent isotope fractionation - with 
                        11B depleted at the surface of HA - that reaches a maximum at 5 {\textless} pH {\textless} 9 ($\alpha$ = 0.975, $\Delta$ = -25‰) and decreases sharply at pH {\textgreater}9.

It is shown that the extent of isotopic fractionation depends not only on B aqueous speciation but also on the distribution and structure of the borate surface complexes formed. In agreement with energetic constrains, calculation of the isotope fractionation factors between aqueous boric acid and boron surface complexes suggests that the formation of the strained six-membered ring 1,3-diol complex yields a much higher fractionation ($\alpha$
                        BLP1-III = 0.954-0.960, $\Delta$ = -41/-47‰) than that of the very stable five-membered ring 1,2-diol ($\alpha$
                        BLP2-III = 0.983, $\Delta$ = -18‰). The results of this study open new perspectives to understand and model boron biogeochemical cycle. It is predicted that boron sorption onto organic matter can have important consequences for the boron isotopic composition of surface water reservoirs (seawater, groundwater, soil waters) in which either abundant organic surfaces or significant boron concentrations are available. In addition, the large isotope fractionation between aqueous boric acid and surface boron-organic complexes found in the present work makes boron a promising tracer of biologic activity.

The spectra are characterized by three prominent features; a sharp peak (A) at {\~{}}194 eV (the edge feature of trigonal B; III B), a broader peak (B) at 197199 eV (the edge feature of tetrahedral B, IV B), and a broad peak (C) at 200201 eV for tetrahedral B and 203204 eV for trigonal B. The area of peak A is very sensitive to content of III B and its position yields information on B-O bond length and linkage of the BO 3 group. The area of peak B is proportional to content of IV B but quantification is limited by overlap with peak C. The width of peak B increases with increasing divergence of B-O bond lengths, responding to splitting of $\sigma$(t 2 antibonding orbitals. The tetrahedral component of peak C appears to be a $\sigma$-shape resonance. For trigonal B minerals, the relative intensity of peak C and its satellite peaks increases with increase in mean size and/or atomic number of next-nearest- neighbor cations, C being most intense in vonsenite (Fe 2 Fe 3+ BO 5 ). Priceite (Ca 4 B 10 O 19 7H 2 O), of unknown structure, has 80{\%} IV B, and an isolated BX 3 group with III B-O = 1.373(5) {\AA}. Comparison of B K-edge XANES spectra collected using total electron yield (sampling depth {\textless}60 {\AA}) and fluores- cence yield (sampling depth {\textless}1100 {\AA}) shows that borates and borosilicates readily reconstruct in surface and near-surface environments. More profound structural damage involving conversion of IV B to III B occurs in minerals with high contents of IV B, and hydrous Mg borates with interstitial H 2 O are unstable in the high vacuum of the spectrometer.},

abstract = {In a recent study of the shelf region of the East China Sea, Tsunogai et al. [1999] estimated that a combination of air-sea exchange and biological and physical transport processes could transfer carbon from the shelf region into the open ocean at a rate of 35 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Contrasting with the solubility and biological pumps of the open ocean, they described this collective activity as the "continental shelf pump" and suggested that if this pump operated throughout the world's shelf regions, it could be responsible for ocean uptake of similar to1 Gt C yr(-1) (approximate to 50{\%} current ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2). In this work a general circulation model (GCM) is used to explore the potential strength of this pump across the world's shelves. Since the GCM does not represent the continental shelf regions explicitly, a parameterization of the pump has been used. Results of simulations find modeled pump activity very variable between shelf regions, with the East China Sea shelf behaving very similarly to the global average. Storage of pump carbon is particularly high in the Atlantic Ocean and other regions where deep water is formed. A considerable reservoir of pump carbon becomes trapped under the Arctic ice sheet. Simple extrapolations from the results suggest that should shelf regions absorb CO2 at the rate of the East China Sea, the pump would account for a net oceanic uptake of 0.6 Gt C yr(-1).},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between species richness and productivity is fundamental to the management and preservation of biodiversity. Yet despite years of study and intense theoretical interest, this relationship remains controversial. Here, we present the results of a literature survey in which we examined the relationship between species richness and productivity in 171 published studies. We extracted the raw data from published tables and graphs and subjected these data to a standardized analysis, using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and generalized linear-model (GLIM) regression to test for significant positive, negative, or curvilinear relationships between productivity and species diversity. If the rela- tionship was curvilinear, we tested whether the maximum (or minimum) of the curve occurred within the range of productivity values observed (i.e., was there evidence of a hump?). A meta-analysis conducted on the distribution of standardized quadratic regression co- efficients showed that the average quadratic coefficient was negative (i.e., the average species richnessproductivity relationship was curvilinear and decelerating), and that the distribution of standardized quadratic regression coefficients was significantly heterogeneous (i.e., the studies did not sample the same underlying species richnessproductivity relationship). Looking more closely at the patterns of productivitydiversity relationships, we found that, for vascular plants at geographical scales smaller than continents, hump-shaped re- lationships occurred most frequently (4145{\%} of all studies). A positive relationship be- tween productivity and species richness was the next most common pattern, and positive and hump-shaped relationships co-dominated at the continental scale. For animals, positive, negative, and hump-shaped patterns were common at most geographical scales, and no one pattern predominated. For both plants and animals, hump-shaped curves were relatively more common in studies that crossed community boundaries compared to studies conducted within a community type, and plant studies that crossed community types tended to span a greater range of productivity compared to studies within community types. Sample size and plot size did not affect the probability of finding a particular productivitydiversity relationship (e.g., positive, hump-shaped, etc.). However, hump-shaped curves were es- pecially common (65{\%}) in studies of plant diversity that used plant biomass as a measure of productivity, and in studies conducted in aquatic systems.},

The B isotope fractionation between calcite and B(OH)4- increases with increasing growth rate favoring the lighter B isotope for incorporation into calcite whereas no effect of temperature was observed within the temperature range investigated (12°C to 32°C). At the lowest temperature and growth rate $\delta$11B of the calcite almost equals that of B(OH)4- in solution. Applying the surface entrapment model (SEMO) of Watson and Liang (1995) to our data, we demonstrate that the observed effects of temperature and growth rate on B concentration can be explained by processes in the near surface layer of the calcite crystal.},

Most modern mass spectrometers use electron impact sources and magnetic sector mass filters with detection by faraday cups and electron multipliers. Some of the performance characteristics typical of these instruments are described (sensitivity, mass discrimination). Extraction of noble gases from geological samples is for the most part achieved by phase separation, by thermal extraction (furnace) or by crushing in vacuo. The extracted gases need to be purified and separated by a combination of chemical and physical methods.

abstract = {[ 1] We explore using changes in planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca with water depth in a single region to infer relative changes in deep water carbonate chemistry. The Mg/Ca ratio in foraminiferal calcite is quantitatively lowered by dissolution. We exploit this dissolution effect to generate a profile of carbonate ion concentration (CO32-) for the deep waters of the tropical Atlantic during the Last Glacial Maximum. We generated Mg/Ca data for three species, G. ruber, G. sacculifer, and N. dutertrei, from three cores located along a depth transect ( 2.8 to 4.0 km) on the Ceara Rise in the western equatorial Atlantic. We attribute lower Mg/Ca in glacial intervals from the shallow core to changes in sea surface temperature (SST). The even lower glacial Mg/Ca values in the deeper cores are attributed to dissolution and are used to reconstruct a paleo-CO32- profile. Our down core Mg/Ca data for G. ruber and G. sacculifer confirm that these species are more resistant to Mg loss due to dissolution than N. dutertrei. The greater susceptibility of N. dutertrei's Mg content to dissolution limits the utility of this species in thermocline temperature reconstructions to cores above the lysocline but, significant to this study, makes N. dutertrei useful in quantifying changes in deep water CO32-. Our paleo- CO32- reconstruction based on N. dutertrei suggests the Last Glacial Maximum CO32- gradient in the Atlantic was much steeper than today, implying that the boundary between deepwater masses in the Atlantic was shallower during the Last Glacial Maximum. Our results suggest comparison of Mg/Ca from multiple cores from one region could similarly provide constraints on changes in carbonate chemistry in other basins and other time periods.},

In this review, the capabilities of the technique are discussed and examples of the 3D imaging approach for the analysis of model membrane systems, plant single cell, and tissue samples are presented. Ongoing challenges for 3D ToF-SIMS imaging are also discussed along with recent developments that might offer improved 3D imaging prospects in the near future.},

Furthermore, deep cold-water coral bioherms may be among the first marine ecosystems to be affected by ocean acidification. Colonies of L. pertusa were collected during a cruise in 2006 to cold-water coral bioherms of the Mingulay reef complex (Hebrides, North Atlantic). Shortly after sample collection onboard these corals were labelled with calcium-45. The same experimental approach was used to assess calcification rates and how those changed due to reduced pH during a cruise to the Skagerrak (North Sea) in 2007. The highest calcification rates were found in youngest polyps with up to 1{\%} d{\&}minus;1 new skeletal growth and average rates of 0.11{\&}plusmn;0.02{\%} d{\&}minus;1{\&}plusmn;S.E.). Lowering pH by 0.15 and 0.3 units relative to the ambient level resulted in calcification being reduced by 30 and 56{\%}. Lower pH reduced calcification more in fast growing, young polyps (59{\%} reduction) than in older polyps (40{\%} reduction). Thus skeletal growth of young and fast calcifying corallites suffered more from ocean acidification. Nevertheless, L. pertusa exhibited positive net calcification (as measured by 45Ca incorporation) even at an aragonite saturation state ({\&}Omega;a) below 1.},

abstract = {Carbonates are only a minor sink of oceanic lithium, yet the presence of this element and its abundance relative to other metal cations in natural carbonate minerals is routinely used as a paleo-environmental proxy. To date, however, experimental studies on the influence of physicochemical parameters that may control lithium incorporation in calcite, like pH and precipitation rate, are scarce. Therefore, we experimentally studied Li incorporation in calcite to quantify the apparent partitioning coefficient (D Li∗ =[Formula presented]) between calcite and reactive fluid as a function of calcite growth rate and pH. The obtained results suggest that D Li∗ increases with calcite growth rate, according to the expression: LogD Li∗ =1.331(±0.116)×LogRate+6.371(±0.880)(R 2 =0.87;10 -8.1 ≤Rate≤10 -7.1 molm -2 s -1 ) Additionally the experimental results suggest that D Li∗ values exhibit a strong pH dependence. For experiments conducted at similar growth rates (i.e. Rate = 10 −7.7±0.2 mol m −2 s −1 ), D Li∗ decreases with increasing pH as described by: LogD Li∗ =-0.57(±0.047)×pH+0.759(±0.366)(R 2 =0.90;6.3{\textless}pH{\textless}9.5) The positive correlation of D Li∗ with calcite growth rate is consistent with an increasing entrapment of traces/impurities at rapidly growing calcite surfaces, although the incorporation of monovalent cations such as Li + and Na + does not necessarily imply a substitution of Ca 2+ ions in the calcite crystal lattice. The dependence of D Li∗ on pH can be considered as an indication that activity of aqueous HCO 3− controls the incorporation of Li + in calcite. The proposed coupled reaction can be explained by charge balance of these monovalent species, which is likely valid at least during the initial step of adsorption on the crystal surface. These new findings shed light on the mechanisms controlling Li incorporation in calcite and have direct implications on the use of Li partitioning coefficients in natural carbonates as an environmental proxy.},

The mechanism of transformation is enigmatic: the transforming spicule displays both amorphous and crystalline properties, with no defined crystallization front. Here, we use X-ray photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy with probing size of 40-200 nm. We resolve 3 distinct mineral phases: An initial short-lived, presumably hydrated ACC phase, followed by an intermediate transient form of ACC, and finally the biogenic crystalline calcite phase. The amorphous and crystalline phases are juxtaposed, often appearing in adjacent sites at a scale of tens of nanometers. We propose that the amorphous-crystal transformation propagates in a tortuous path through preexisting 40- to 100-nm amorphous units, via a secondary nucleation mechanism.},

abstract = {This experimental study determined the effect of ionic strength (IS) on the uptake of Mg into calcites that grew by the classical step propagation process. Using flow-through AFM and defined solution chemistry, calcite was grown in NaCl and KCl solutions of known supersaturation state while measuring the corresponding growth kinetics. Analysis of the resulting calcite compositions by SIMS shows that Mg content is inversely correlated with IS for both electrolytes. A sixfold increase in IS decreases the Mg-content by up to 40{\%}. Overgrowths that developed in NaCl solutions contain more Mg than samples that grew in KCl solutions. The corresponding kinetic measurements reveal that step propagation rates are independent of IS within experimental error but are electrolyte-specific. In NaCl solutions, steps with the obtuse geometry move significantly faster than acute steps, but in KCl solutions, the acute and obtuse steps move at similar rates. Analysis of the data suggests that the decrease in Mg content with increasing IS arises from the interplay of ion-kink interactions between the background cations (Na+ or K+), the primary solute cation (Ca2+), and the impurity (Mg2+). A simple physical model proposes that increasing levels of electrolytes block the attachment of the strongly hydrated Mg2+ ion relative to Ca2+ but the effects are step-specific for each type of electrolyte. Whereas K+ interacts weakly with kink sites along both step directions, Na+ interacts preferentially with acute steps and, consequently, slows their rate of step propagation relative to obtuse steps. Because Na+ increases the fraction of the surface that develops from acute steps and because Mg is preferentially incorporated into the kink sites of acute steps, calcite overgrowths developed in NaCl solutions contain more Mg than those in grown in KCl. Thus, the salt-specific Mg contents measured in this study can be explained by shifts in the distribution of step types and the ability of each step type to incorporate Mg. The findings reconcile apparent discrepancies regarding the effect of IS on calcite kinetics and Mg incorporation observed in laboratory-based studies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Coral reefs feed millions of people worldwide, provide coastal protection and generate billions of dollars annually in tourism revenue. The underlying architecture of a reef is a biogenic carbonate structure that accretes over many years of active biomineralization by calcifying organisms, including corals and algae. Ocean acidification poses a chronic threat to coral reefs by reducing the saturation state of the aragonite mineral of which coral skeletons are primarily composed, and lowering the concentration of carbonate ions required to maintain the carbonate reef. Reduced calcification, coupled with increased bioerosion and dissolution, may drive reefs into a state of net loss this century. Our ability to predict changes in ecosystem function and associated services ultimately hinges on our understanding of community- and ecosystem-scale responses. Past research has primarily focused on the responses of individual species rather than evaluating more complex, community-level responses. Here we use an in situ carbon dioxide enrichment experiment to quantify the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to acidification. We present an estimate of community-scale calcification sensitivity to ocean acidification that is, to our knowledge, the first to be based on a controlled experiment in the natural environment. This estimate provides evidence that near-future reductions in the aragonite saturation state will compromise the ecosystem function of coral reefs.},

abstract = {The experimental distribution coefficients, K-d', for trace elements in carbonate minerals show a systematic pattern of behavior that differs from that expected if the distribution were controlled by equilibrium thermodynamics. Regression of experimental distribution coefficients, K-d', from the literature shows that they correlate well with the quotient of the solubility products of the trace element and host carbonate. However, the slope of the correlation line differs from that predicted by equilibrium theory in a way that suggests that the experiments are affected by a kinetic process, whereby the trace element is incorporated into the growing carbonate crystal at a rate that is either faster or slower than the incorporation of Ca. The correlations predict that the K-d' for elements that form rhombdohedral carbonates (e.g., Cd, Zn, Cu, Mn, etc.) is expressed by K-d' = 1.6(K-MCO3/K-TrCO3)(0.57) for calcite and K-d' = 4.1(K-MCO3/K-TrCO3)(0.57) for siderite. These correlations can be used to estimate the K-d' values for cases where no experimental data are available, including for other phases and other temperatures. Thus, the experimental K-d' values can be used to understand general trends in trace element behavior. Analysis of K-d' for calcite shows that this mineral can effectively sequester a variety of toxic cations (e.g., Pb, Cd, Cu, etc.) from solution, so precipitation of calcite from contaminated solutions may provide an effective method of environmental remediation. On the other hand, values of K-d' should be used with caution when interpreting ancient geochemical environments for carbonates, because K-d' values are strongly rate-dependent and the rates of mineral precipitation are seldom known.

The mean settling velocity was 74f39 m d-l for aggregates ranging from 2.4 to 75 mm in maximum length. Sinking rates in the field varied exponentially with aggregate size and dry weight and were consistently up to four times slower than rates measured in the laboratory. The excess densities of the 80 aggregates examined were calculated from volume and dry weight and ranged over four orders of magnitude with a median of 1.4 x 1O-4 g cm-3. Aggregates of marine snow sank more slowly than predicted for either solid or porous spheres of equivalent volume and density, although their velocities were within the range expected for equivalent sinking prolate ellipsoids. No relationships between settling velocity and either excess density or particle shape were found. Drag coefficients of marine snow were also higher than predicted by theory for spheres of equivalent volume and density. These deviations from theoretical expectations may be partially explained by errors in the estimation of the excess densities of aggregates. Variability in the densities of the heterogeneous primary particles comprising marine snow (fecal pellets, clay-mineral particlcs, phytoplankton, molts, etc.) and the potential for buoyancy regulation by indi-vidual phytoplankton cells inhabiting aggregates make determination of excess density especially problematic.},

abstract = {To characterize the influence of solution composition and specific dissolved components on the complex mechanism of calcite precipitation in seawater, a kinetic study was carried out in NaCl-CaCl2 solutions at a total ionic strength of 0.7 m. Experiments were conducted at 298.15 K and at four different CO2 partial pressures. A constant addition technique was used to maintain [Ca2+] at 10.5 mmol/kg, while [CO3(2-)] was varied to isolate the role of this variable on the precipitation rate of calcite. Like in seawater solutions, calcite precipitation in the NaCl-CaCl2 solution is dominated by the following reaction: [GRAPHICS] where k(f1) and k(b1) are, respectively, the forward and backward reaction rate constants. The net precipitation rate, R, can be described at any given P(CO2) by R = k(f1)(a(Ca))na(a(CO3))nb - k(b1) or log (R + k(b1)) = log K(f1) + 3 log [CO3(2-)], where a(i) are n(i) are, respectively, the activity and partial reaction order of the species involved in the reaction, K(f1) = k1(a(Ca)2+)na(gammaCo3(2-)3 and gamma is the activity coefficient. The partial reaction order with respect to the CO3(2-) ion concentration is, as in seawater solutions, equal to 3. Unlike seawater, however, the intercept, log K(f1), increases with increasing P(CO2). This is interpreted as a contribution of the HCO3- ion to the precipitation reaction. Its role was evaluated from the difference in the net rate R at every P(CO2) and a fixed [CO3(2-)]. Solution of a system of nonlinear equations allowed us to determine that the partial reaction order with respect to the HCO3- ion concentration is nearly equal to 2 and represented by the following reaction: [GRAPHICS] Under our experimental conditions (1.1 {\textless} OMEGA(c) {\textless} 8.3, where OMEGA(c) is the saturation state of the solution with respect to calcite), the calcite precipitation rate can be described by the following expression: R = K(f1)[CO3(2-)]3 - k(b1) + K(f2)[HCO3-]2 - k(b2) (gammaH2CO3.)alphaP(CO2), where K(f2) = k2(a(Ca)2+)nd(gammaHCO3-)2 and alpha is the solubility of CO2 in the experimental solution. We propose that, since the partial reaction order with respect to [CO3(2-)] is the same in both seawater and our experimental NaCl-CaCl2 solutions, the precipitation mechanism of pure calcite in the latter solution may be similar to that of a 8 mol{\%} magnesian calcite from seawater. We suggest that Mg2+ and SO4(2-) ions, which are both major seawater constituents and calcite growth inhibitors, may not modify the precipitation mechanism, but decrease the rate constants of individual reactions. Finally, as opposed to our observations in the NaCl-CaCl2 solution, the lack of P(CO2) dependence reported for calcite precipitation rates measured in seawater may be explained by a differential inhibition of the reactions participating in the overall growth process.},

Comparative delta(18)O and Sr/Ca data from the broadly coeval marine gastropod Clavilithes macrospira, which exhibits a linear growth rate through ontogeny, also shows a significant increase in Sr concentration with age as well as seasonal, possibly temperature-related variations. Our observations show that neither growth, calcification rate, nor temperature can be the sole factor controlling Sr incorporation into molluscan aragonite, Metabolic activity, related to factors such as temperature, salinity, age, and growth rate, is likely to exert the primary control over Sr/Ca ratios in aragonitic mollusks.},

Use of this proxy benefits from an intimate understanding of chemical kinetics and thermodynamic isotope exchange reactions between the two dominant boron-bearing species in seawater: boric acid B(OH)3 and borate ion B(OH)4-. However, because of our inability to quantitatively separate these species in solution, the degree of boron isotope exchange has only been known through theoretical estimates. In this study, we present results of a spectrophotometric procedure wherein the boron isotope equilibrium constant (11-10KB) is determined empirically from the difference in the dissociation constants of 11B(OH)3 and 10B(OH)3 in pure water, 0.6 mol kg- 1 H2O KCl and artificial seawater. Within experimental uncertainty, our results show no dependence of 11-10KB on temperature, but 11-10KB at 25 °C in pure water was statistically different than results obtained in solutions at high ionic strength. 11-10KB of the seawater (S = 35, BT = 0.01 mol kg- 1 H2O) at 25 °C is 1.0272 ± 0.0006. This result is significantly larger than the theoretical value used in numerous paleo-pH studies (11-10KB = 1.0194). {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Any sediment assemblage of planktonic Foraminifera contains at least three kinds of information: (1) the amount of solution it has experienced, (2) its geographic origin, (3) the range of depth habitats represented by the constituents species. By ranking the species with respect to their resistance to solution, their latitudinal occurence, and their preferred depth habitat, a portion of this information can be extracted. Selective solution can change the apparent latitudinal range of an assemblage and its depth habitat aspect. Corrections must be applied before drawing conclusions on the latter two ecological properties. It is then possible to trace in the sediments the movement of water bodies at different depth levels in the ocean. In the central Atlantic, the present current structure at the surface of the ocean is reflected in the bottom sediments with astonishing precision. The level at which the rate of ocean is reflected in the bottom sediments with astonishing precision. The level at which the rate of solution of calcium carbonate rapidly increases apparently coincides with the top of the Antarctic Bottom Water. Studies of older sediments suggest that the surface currents were wider, and the solution level stood higher in the past.},

The nacre of the shell is characterized by a stacked compartment structure with a uniformly oriented c axis of aragonite crystals in each compartment. Using a calcium carbonate-binding assay, we identified an acidic matrix protein, Pif, in the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata that specifically binds to aragonite crystals. The Pif complementary DNA (cDNA) encoded a precursor protein, which was posttranslationally cleaved to produce Pif 97 and Pif 80. The results from immunolocalization, a knockdown experiment that used RNA interference, and in vitro calcium carbonate crystallization studies strongly indicate that Pif regulates nacre formation.},

Systematic large and correlated variation of Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca, Ba/Ca and Zn/Ca but relatively uniform Sr/Ca are observed through the test walls of analysed species (Globigerinoides sacculifer, Globigerinoides ruber, Neogloboquadrina pachyderma and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei). Distinct chamber and chamber-wall layer compositions can be resolved within individual tests, and Mg/Ca compositional differences observed in sequentially precipitated test components of the different species analysed are consistent with seawater temperature changes occurring with habitat migration during their adult life-cycle stages. Estimated test calcification temperatures are in keeping with available seawater temperature constraints, indicating the potential for accurate seawater temperature reconstruction using LA-ICP-MS. Mg-rich ({\textless}1-6 mol{\%} Mg) surface veneers that are also enriched in Mn, Ba, and Zn have been found on all species and all fossil tests, as well as on live-sampled tests of G. ruber, with the latter suggesting a possible biogenic origin.

@article{Richter1993,
abstract = {We have used a diffusion-advection-reaction model for Sr exchange during deep-sea carbonate diagenesis to determine the rate and consequences of Sr exchange between porewaters and bulk carbonate at six DSDP sites (590B, 575, 593, 516, 305 and 289) where the required Sr concentration and isotopic composition data for the interstitial waters are available from the literature. The model can reproduce both the Sr2+ and 87Sr86Sr profiles in the porewaters at each of the sites by adjusting the rate of Sr exchange due to solution-reprecipitation as a function of sediment age. We find that the rate of solution-reprecipitation at all of the sites is highest for the youngest sediment (1-10{\%}/m.y.) and decreases by about an order of magnitude over the first 10 m.y. of sediment age. The effect of this exchange on the properties of the bulk carbonate is to reduce the Sr content by 5-25{\%}, depending primarily on the sedimentation rate, and shift the 87Sr86Sr by as much as 0.00004 from the value the sediment had when first deposited. Isotopic shifts of this magnitude are large compared to present analytical uncertainties and therefore should be corrected for when using bulk carbonate 87Sr86Sr for stratigraphic correlation. The average Sr loss in the carbonate sections studied is about 15{\%}, from which we conclude that the Sr flux from carbonate sediments to the overlying ocean is of the order of 15{\%} of the riverine Sr flux. We also show that the isotopic composition of the diagenetic Sr flux is at all times quite close to the contemporaneous seawater value and therefore this flux plays a very minor role in the overall Sr budget that determines the Sr isotopic composition of seawater. The range of Sr losses from bulk carbonate due to diagenesis that we calculate is too small to account for the typical decrease in Sr content seen in pelagic carbonates as a function of age (about 70{\%} over the first 100 m.y.). We conclude that this decrease is not the result of diagenesis and must involve some changing property of the ocean itself. ?? 1993.},

Thermodynamic and kinetic effects on ??11B and B partitioning are not yet fully constrained, underscoring the importance of exploring possible effects of growth rate on boron incorporation in synthetic calcium carbonate minerals, which is the focus of this study. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) measurements of B/Ca and ??11B were performed on single crystal of calcite synthesized by diffusion of CO2 under controlled conditions from a solution of NH4Cl-CaCl2 doped with boron. Growth rates of calcite (V, nm/s) within crystals grown isothermally at 24.6??C were monitored by sequentially spiking calcite-precipitating fluids with rare earth element (REE) dopants. The REE were analyzed with SIMS at spots that match those locations where B/Ca and ??11B ratios were measured. Values for the boron Nernst partition coefficient, defined as DB=B(calcite)/B(fluid), increase from 0.5 (pHNBS=8.15) to 0.9 (pH=8.00) with values of V increasing from 0.04 to 0.13nm/s. For ??11B behavior, it was not possible to draw conclusive results due to the analytical error (2.2??? 2??). pH effects on DB during calcite precipitation, associated with an increase in pH from 8.00 to 8.15, appear to be masked by the competing effects of changing V. We conclude that over the range of growth rates and other conditions investigated in this study, growth rate effects on B partitioning need to be accounted for when using B/Ca ratios in biogenic calcite as a proxy for seawater carbonate system parameters. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This Discussion Meeting Issue of the Philosophical Transactions A had its genesis in a Discussion Meeting of the Royal Society which took place on 10-11 October 2011. The Discussion Meeting, entitled 'Warm climates of the past: a lesson for the future?', brought together 16 eminent international speakers from the field of palaeoclimate, and was attended by over 280 scientists and members of the public. Many of the speakers have contributed to the papers compiled in this Discussion Meeting Issue. The papers summarize the talks at the meeting, and present further or related work. This Discussion Meeting Issue asks to what extent information gleaned from the study of past climates can aid our understanding of future climate change. Climate change is currently an issue at the forefront of environmental science, and also has important sociological and political implications. Most future predictions are carried out by complex numerical models; however, these models cannot be rigorously tested for scenarios outside of the modern, without making use of past climate data. Furthermore, past climate data can inform our understanding of how the Earth system operates, and can provide important contextual information related to environmental change. All past time periods can be useful in this context; here, we focus on past climates that were warmer than the modern climate, as these are likely to be the most similar to the future. This introductory paper is not meant as a comprehensive overview of all work in this field. Instead, it gives an introduction to the important issues therein, using the papers in this Discussion Meeting Issue, and other works from all the Discussion Meeting speakers, as exemplars of the various ways in which past climates can inform projections of future climate. Furthermore, we present new work that uses a palaeo constraint to quantitatively inform projections of future equilibrium ice sheet change.},

@article{Yool2003,
abstract = {Among phytoplankton the diatoms are strong competitors and contribute significantly to total global primary production. Aspects of their life history, notably their high sinking rates, make them important to the export flux of carbon into the ocean interior. Unlike the majority of other phytoplankton, they utilize silicic acid (=silicate) to construct their cell walls and are controlled by its availability and distribution. Here a simple model is developed to study the relationship between the diatoms and the ocean's silicon cycle. The ecological component of this model pits the slightly superior diatoms against all other algae, with both groups competing for phosphate while the diatoms additionally require silicic acid. The model agrees reasonably with observed distributions of nutrients and with their biogeochemical fluxes. While theoretically superior, the diatoms are held in check by the availability of silicic acid, allowing the persistence and numerical dominance of the other algae. The concentrations of both nutrients are homeostatically controlled by the phytoplankton, and resist perturbations. Analysis finds that primary production in the model is ultimately controlled by phosphate, with silicic acid abundance controlling the fraction of the total produced by diatoms. Sensitivity analyses using more ecologically detailed variants of the model find that these results are generally robust. The model's treatment of the “silica pump" hypothesis [Dugdale and Wilkerson, 1998] is also examined.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the implementation of governance for sustainable landscapes, based on a catchment case study in lowland England. A participatory research process, spanning six and a half years, employed formal and informal in-depth interviews, focus group work and workshop techniques with 71 stakeholders representative of a wide range of interests in the catchment. A scenario design process within a GIS framework was used as a focus for capturing the key issues and visions of the stakeholders. Two contrasting but plausible scenarios for 2020 emerged from this process; one scenario was driven by the sustainable intensification of agricultural production and world trade, the other by the enhanced protection of ecosystem services and multi-objective land use. It was clear from discussions with stakeholders that the mechanisms for delivering an integrated approach to landscape management are not currently in place, although there have been some policy successes that could be built upon. There is also a need for new approaches to land tenure which include tax incentives and improved forms of cooperation and leadership in both policy and contiguous landscape stewardship. The methodology itself was appreciated by the stakeholders who found it useful to think more holistically. In addition, the study demonstrates an approach that individual practitioners and researchers can develop the skills to implement. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We report O-18 and minor element (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca) data acquired by high-resolution, in situ secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) from planktic foraminiferal shells and 100-500 mu m sized diagenetic crystallites recovered from a deep-sea record (ODP Site 865) of the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM). The O-18 of crystallites (similar to 1.2 Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB)) is similar to 4.8 higher than that of planktic foraminiferal calcite (-3.6 PDB), while crystallite Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios are slightly higher and substantially lower than in planktic foraminiferal calcite, respectively. The focused stratigraphic distribution of the crystallites signals an association with PETM conditions; hence, we attribute their formation to early diagenesis initially sourced by seafloor dissolution (burndown) ensued by reprecipitation at higher carbonate saturation. The Mg/Ca ratios of the crystallites are an order of magnitude lower than those predicted by inorganic precipitation experiments, which may reflect a degree of inheritance from donor phases of biogenic calcite that underwent solution in the sediment column. In addition, SIMS O-18 and electron microprobe Mg/Ca analyses that were taken within a planktic foraminiferal shell yield parallel increases along traverses that coincide with muricae blades on the chamber wall. The parallel O-18 and Mg/Ca increases indicate a diagenetic origin for the blades, but their O-18 value (-0.5 PDB) is lower than that of crystallites suggesting that these two phases of diagenetic carbonate formed at different times. Finally, we posit that elevated levels of early diagenesis acted in concert with sediment mixing and carbonate dissolution to attenuate the O-18 decrease signaling PETM warming in whole-shell records published for Site 865.},

Nevertheless, it is demonstrated that these two proxies can be used to fully constrain the carbonate system of surface water in the Caribbean Sea (ODP Site 999A) over the last 130??kyr. This reconstruction shows that during much of the Holocene and the last interglacial period surface water at Site 999A was in equilibrium with the atmosphere with respect to CO2. During the intervening colder periods although the surface water pCO2 was lower than the Holocene, it was a minor to significant source of CO2 to the atmosphere possibly due to either an expansion of the eastern equatorial Atlantic upwelling zone, or a more local expansion of coastal upwelling in the southern Caribbean. Such reorganisation of the oceanic carbonate system in favour of a larger source of CO2 to the atmosphere from the equatorial ocean may require mechanisms responsible for lowering atmospheric CO2 during glacial periods to be more efficient than previously supposed. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Fourteen hours after fertilization (the trochophore stage), larvae form an incipient shell of 100-150 nm thick with a columnar contrast. Selected-area electron diffraction analysis showed a single-crystal aragonite pattern with the c-axis perpendicular to the shell surface. Plan-view TEM analysis suggested that the shell contains high density of {\{}110{\}} twins, which are the origin of the columnar contrast in the cross-sectional images. 72 h after fertilization (the veliger stage), the shell grows up to 1.2-1.4 ??m thick accompanying an additional granular layer between the preexisting layer and embryo to form a distinctive two-layer structure. The granular layer is also composed of aragonite crystals sharing their c-axes perpendicular to the shell surface, but the crystals are arranged with a flexible rotation around the c-axes and not restricted solely to the {\{}110{\}} twin relation. No evidence to suggest the existence of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) was found through the observation.

abstract = {Cool tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are reported for warm Paleogene greenhouse climates based on the $\delta$18O of planktonic foraminiferal tests. These results are difficult to reconcile with models of greenhouse gas–forced climate. It has been suggested that this “cool tropics paradox” arises from postdepositional alteration of foraminiferal calcite, yielding erroneously high $\delta$18O values. Recrystallization of foraminiferal tests is cryptic and difficult to quantify, and the compilation of robust $\delta$18O records from moderately altered material remains challenging. Scanning electron microscopy of planktonic foraminiferal chamber-wall cross sections reveals that the basal area of muricae, pustular outgrowths on the chamber walls of species belonging to the genus Morozovella, contain no mural pores and may be less susceptible to postdepositional alteration. We analyzed the $\delta$18O in muricae bases of morozovellids from the central Pacific (Ocean Drilling Program Site 865) by ion microprobe using 10 $\mu$m pits with an analytical reproducibility of ±0.34‰ (2 standard deviations). In situ measurements of $\delta$18O in these domains yield consistently lower values than those published for conventional multispecimen analyses. Assuming that the original $\delta$18O is largely preserved in the basal areas of muricae, this new $\delta$18O record indicates Early Paleogene (∼49–56 Ma) tropical SSTs in the central Pacific were 4°–8°C higher than inferred from the previously published $\delta$18O record and that SSTs reached at least ∼33°C during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum. This study demonstrates the utility of ion microprobe analysis for generating more reliable paleoclimate records from moderately altered foraminiferal tests preserved in deep-sea sediments. },

abstract = {In order to study Strontium (Sr) partitioning and isotope fractionation of Sr and Calcium (Ca) in calcite we performed precipitation (T) experiments decoupling temperature and precipitation rate (R∗). Calcite was precipitated at 12.5, 25.0 and 37.5 °C by diffusing NH3 and CO2 gases into aqueous solutions closely following the experimental setup of Lemarchand et al. (2004). The precipitation rate (R∗) for every sample was determined applying the initial rate method and from the specific surface area of almost all samples for each reaction. The order of reaction with respect to Ca2+ ions was determined to be one and independent of T. However, the order of reaction with respect to HCO3− changed from three to one as temperature increases from 12.5, 25 °C and 37.5 °C. Strontium incorporated into calcite (expressed as DSr = [Sr/Ca]calcite/[Sr/Ca]solution) was found to be R∗ and T dependent. As a function of increasing R∗ the $\Delta$88/86Sr-values become more negative and as temperature increases the $\Delta$88/86Sr values also increase at constant R∗. The DSr and $\Delta$88/86Sr-values are correlated to a high degree and depend only on R∗ being independent of temperature, complexation and varying initial ratios. Latter observation may have important implications for the study of diagenesis, the paleo-sciences and the reconstruction of past environmental conditions. Calcium isotope fractionation ($\Delta$44/40Ca) was also found to be R∗ and T dependent. For 12.5 and 25.0 °C we observe a general increase of the $\Delta$44/40Ca values as a function of R∗ (Lemarchand et al. type behavior, Lemarchand et al. (2004)). Whereas at 37.5 °C a significant decreasing $\Delta$44/40Ca is observed relative to increasing R∗ (Tang et al. type behavior, Tang et al. (2008)). In order to reconcile the discrepant observations we suggest that the temperature triggered change from a Ca2+-NH3-aquacomplex covalent controlled bonding to a Ca2+-H2O-aquacomplex van-der-Waals controlled bonding caused the change in sign of the R∗ − $\Delta$44/40Ca slope due to the switch of an equilibrium type of isotope fractionation related to the covalent bonding during lower temperatures to a kinetic type of isotope fractionation at higher temperatures. This is supported by the observation that the $\Delta$44/40Ca ratios tend to depend on the [Ca]:[DIC] ratio at 12.5 and 25 °C but is highly independent at 37.5 °C. Our observations imply the chemical fluid composition and temperature dependent complexation controls the amount and direction of Ca isotope fractionation in contrast to the Sr isotopes which do not show any change of its fractionation behavior as a function of complexation in the liquid phase.},

abstract = {We investigated an extreme behavioural specialization in the army ant Eciton burchellii. The spectacular group raids of these ants, which can contain up to 200 000 workers, always remain connected to the nest by a 'principal trail' of forager traffic. Remarkably, some workers use their bodies to plug potholes in the natural surfaces that the principal trail travels over, to provide a partly living surface for their nestmates to use. We found that this highly specialized behaviour results in a clear net benefit to the colony. Our experiments show that foragers do not discriminate against surfaces that force all individuals to run as slowly as the smallest workers, but that this prompts some ants to plug neighbouring low-quality surfaces. Individuals size-match to the hole they plug and cooperate to plug larger holes. The resulting modified surface allows prey-laden foragers to attain maximum speed. Overall, this results in a strong positive relationship between ant size and speed and an increase in the mean speed of prey-laden traffic. Moreover, calculations suggest that under a range of realistic scenarios, plugging behaviour results in a clear increase in daily prey intake. Broadly, our study provides rare quantitative evidence that extreme specialization by a minority can significantly improve the performance of a majority, and benefit the group as a whole. It also suggests, however, that these benefits are a consequence of the unusual and derived foraging strategy of E. burchellii. This highlights the importance of considering ecology and evolutionary history in the study of social organization in animal societies. ?? 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {The Baltic Sea is a large brackish semienclosed sea whose species-poor fish community supports important commercial and recreational fisheries. Both the fish species and the fisheries are strongly affected by climate variations. These climatic effects and the underlying mechanisms are briefly reviewed. We then use recent regional – scale climate – ocean modelling results to consider how climate change during this century will affect the fish community of the Baltic and fisheries management. Expected climate changes in northern Europe will likely affect both the temperature and salinity of the Baltic, causing it to become warmer and fresher. As an estuarine ecosystem with large horizontal and vertical salinity gradients, biodiversity will be particularly sensitive to changes in salinity which can be expected as a consequence of altered precipitation patterns. Marine-tolerant species will be disadvantaged and their distributions will partially contract from the Baltic Sea; habitats of freshwater species will likely expand. Although some new species can be expected to immigrate because of an expected increase in sea temperature, only a few of these species will be able to successfully colonize the Baltic because of its low salinity. Fishing fleets which presently target marine species (e.g. cod, herring, sprat, plaice, sole) in the Baltic will likely have to relocate to more marine areas or switch to other species which tolerate decreasing salinities. Fishery management thresholds that trigger reductions in fishing quotas or fishery closures to conserve local populations (e.g. cod, salmon) will have to be reassessed as the ecological basis on which existing thresholds have been established changes, and new thresholds will have to be developed for immigrant species. The Baltic situation illustrates some of the uncertainties and complexities associated with forecasting how fish populations, communities and industries dependent on an estuarine ecosystem might respond to future climate change.},

Here we report the exploitation of a novel class of sequence-specific non-natural polymers called peptoids as tunable agents that dramatically control CaCO(3) mineralization. We show that amphiphilic peptoids composed of hydrophobic and anionic monomers exhibit both a high degree of control over calcite growth morphology and an unprecedented 23-fold acceleration of growth at a peptoid concentration of only 50 nM, while acidic peptides of similar molecular weight exhibited enhancement factors of only ∼2 or less. We further show that both the morphology and rate controls depend on peptoid sequence, side-chain chemistry, chain length, and concentration. These findings provide guidelines for developing sequence-specific non-natural polymers that mimic the functions of natural peptides or proteins in their ability to direct mineralization of CaCO(3), with an eye toward their application to sequestration of CO(2) through mineral trapping.},

abstract = {Conceptual and numerical models of nitrogen cycling in temperate forests assume that nitrogen is lost from these ecosystems predominantly by way of inorganic forms, such as nitrate and ammonium ions. Of these, nitrate is thought to be particularly mobile, being responsible for nitrogen loss to deep soil and stream waters. But human activities-such as fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer production and land-use change-have substantially altered the nitrogen cycle over large regions, making it difficult to separate natural aspects of nitrogen cycling from those induced by human perturbations. Here we report stream chemistry data from 100 unpolluted primary forests in temperate South America. Although the sites exhibit a broad range of environmental factors that influence ecosystem nutrient cycles (such as climate, parent material, time of ecosystem development, topography and biotic diversity), we observed a remarkably consistent pattern of nitrogen loss across all forests. In contrast to findings from forests in polluted regions, streamwater nitrate concentrations are exceedingly low, such that nitrate to ammonium ratios were less than unity, and dissolved organic nitrogen is responsible for the majority of nitrogen losses from these forests. We therefore suggest that organic nitrogen losses should be considered in models of forest nutrient cycling, which could help to explain observations of nutrient limitation in temperate forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {The Mg/Ca of planktic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber (white) is a widely applied proxy for tropical and sub-tropical sea-surface temperature. The accuracy with which temperature can be reconstructed depends on how accurately relationships between Mg/Ca and temperature and the multiple secondary controls on Mg/Ca are known; however, these relationships remain poorly quantified under oceanic conditions. Here, we present new calibrations based on 440 sediment trap/plankton tow samples from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, including 130 new samples from the Bay of Bengal/Arabian Sea and the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Our results indicate temperature, salinity and the carbonate system all significantly influence Mg/Ca in G. ruber (white). We propose two calibration models: The first model assumes pH is the controlling carbonate system parameter. In this model, Mg/Ca has a temperature sensitivity of 6.0±0.8{\%}/°C (2$\sigma$), a salinity sensitivity of 3.3±2.2{\%}/PSU and a pH sensitivity of −8.3±7.7{\%}/0.1 pH units; The second model assumes carbonate ion concentration ([CO32−]) is the controlling carbonate system parameter. In this model, Mg/Ca has a temperature sensitivity of 6.7±0.8{\%}/°C, a salinity sensitivity of 5.0±3.0{\%}/PSU and a [CO32−] sensitivity of −0.24±0.11{\%}/$\mu$mol kg −1 . In both models, the temperature sensitivity is significantly lower than the widely-applied sensitivity of 9.0±0.6{\%}/°C. Application of our new calibrations to down-core data from the Last Glacial Maximum, considering whole ocean changes in salinity and carbonate chemistry, indicate a cooling of 2.4±1.6°C in the tropical oceans if pH is the controlling parameter and 1.5±1.4°C if [CO32−] is the controlling parameter.},

abstract = {Over the last four decades, different hypotheses of Ca2+ and dissolved inorganic carbon transport to the intracellular site of calcite precipitation have been put forth for Emiliania huxleyi (Lohmann) Hay {\&} Mohler. The objective of this study was to assess these hypotheses by means of mathematical models. It is shown that a vesicle-based Ca2+ transport would require very high intravesicular Ca2+ concentrations, high vesicle fusion frequencies as well as a fast membrane recycling inside the cell. Furthermore, a kinetic model for the calcification compartment is presented that describes the internal chemical environment in terms of carbonate chemistry including calcite precipitation. Substrates for calcite precipitation are transported with different stoichiometries across the compartment membrane. As a result, the carbonate chemistry inside the compartment changes and hence influences the calcification rate. Moreover, the effect of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity within the compartment is analyzed. One very promising model version is based on a Ca2+/H+ antiport, CO2 diffusion, and a CA inside the calcification compartment. Another promising model version is based on an import of Ca2+ and HCO3 and an export of H+.},

abstract = {1 One of the most elegant mechanisms forwarded for late Quaternary atmospheric CO2 variability concerns the sensitivity of calcium carbonate preservation in deep ocean sediments to the relative delivery rates of calcium carbonate and particulate organic carbon (the CaCO3: POC "rain ratio''). It was implicitly assumed that any change in the CaCO3: POC rain ratio of biogenic material produced in the surface ocean will be communicated directly to the sediments. This would allow relatively subtle shifts in ecosystem composition to affect sedimentary CaCO3 preservation and thus atmospheric CO2). However, recent research into the controls on the transport of POC to depth suggests that the rain ratio "seen'' by the sediments may instead be buffered against any perturbation occurring at the surface. This casts doubt on the viability of hypotheses envisaging ecological changes as a means of accounting for the observed glacial-interglacial CO2 signal.},

abstract = {The objective of this review is to show that biomineralization of apatite appears to have a close relationship to the metabolism of phosphate via bioavailable polyphosphates, the production of phosphate-containing, electron-dense granules, and the action of mitochondria. We do not claim to cover all of the theories of apatite mineralization but have tried to collect historical work in apatite biomineralization research and show how the observations in the literature may be tied together by polyphosphate chemistry and biochemistry. Enzymatic polymerization of phosphate enables an organism to store high concentrations of phosphate and calcium without risking an undesired precipitation of apatite. Enzymatic hydrolytic degradation allows for the controlled increase of orthophosphate by the destruction of polyphosphate. Polyphosphates also serve as storage sites for cations, such as calcium, and as alternate energy sources for some organisms who are exposed to anoxic environments. The sequestration power of the calcium-polyphosphate complex offers an excellent chemical method for biological control and transport of free calcium as well as phosphate concentrations within amorphous electron-dense bodies. We conclude this review by presenting the theory that the hydrolytic degradation of polyphosphates, either by spontaneous hydrolytic degradation or by controlled enzymatic hydrolytic degradation with enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, links the formation of apatite mineral to both induced and controlled biomineralization processes. A phosphatic mineral within the vertebrate skeleton offers more flexibility for metabolic processing because it can be dissolved by biologically controlled acidification and its component ions can be stored as bioavailable calcium polyphosphate complexes. This bioavailable store of the building blocks of a metabolically active apatite skeleton offers more biological processing flexibility than a skeleton composed of carbonate minerals, which do not polymerize, or a silicate skeleton, which polymerizes but is not hydrolyzed by any known biological action. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

The observations and lessons learned from calibration studies and first attempts at applying the proxy include:1)data quality is of utmost importance, so any application of the proxy must include evidence that strict analytical protocol has been adhered too, and include replicate analysis of all samples;2)core locations must be selected carefully, depending on the question being pursued with the proxy (i.e., evidence that upwelling or other major oceanographic changes have not occurred at the location; water depths are above the lysocline);3)calibrated, mono-specific foraminifera samples of the appropriate size range and with no signs of dissolution or recrystallization must be chosen; extinct species must be calibrated to extant species;4)absolute pH values can only be reconstructed within the residence time of boron in the oceans, as secular variation of the boron isotope composition of seawater cannot yet be determined beyond this time; until past variations of $\delta$11B seawater are satisfactorily determined, older samples can only be interpreted with regard to relative pH changes within 3-5 Myr time intervals (i.e., intervals similar to the residence time of boron in seawater). These observations allow application of the proxy to an important time window that could provide invaluable information on the controls on climate, and thus addresses ocean-atmosphere interactions resulting from recent anthropogenic perturbations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The role of the Arabidopsis homeobox gene, GLABRA 2 (GL2), in the development of the root epidermis has been investigated. The wild-type epidermis is composed of two cell types, root-hair cells and hairless cells, which are located at distinct positions within the root, implying that positional cues control cell-type differentiation. During the development of the root epidermis, the differentiating root-hair cells (trichoblasts) and the differentiating hairless cells (atrichoblasts) can be distinguished by their cytoplasmic density, vacuole formation, and extent of elongation. We have determined that mutations in the GL2 gene specifically alter the differentiation of the hairless epidermal cells, causing them to produce root hairs, which indicates that GL2 affects epidermal cell identity. Detailed analyses of these differentiating cells showed that, despite forming root hairs, they are similar to atrichoblasts of the wild type in their cytoplasmic characteristics, timing of vacuolation, and extent of cell elongation. The results of in situ nucleic acid hybridization and GUS reporter gene fusion studies show that the GL2 gene is preferentially expressed in the differentiating hairless cells of the wild type, during a period in which epidermal cell identity is believed to be established. These results indicate that the GL2 homeodomain protein normally regulates a subset of the processes that occur during the differentiation of hairless epidermal cells of the Arabidopsis root. Specifically, GL2 appears to act in a cell-position-dependent manner to suppress hair formation in differentiating hairless cells.},

Furthermore, coupled Mg/Ca-oxygen isotope ($\delta$18O) measurements of benthic foraminifera can constrain eustatic sea level (ESL) independent of paleo-shoreline derived approaches. However, this technique suffers from uncertainty regarding the secular variation of the Mg/Ca seawater ratio (Mg/Casw) on timescales of millions of years. Here we present coupled seawater-test Mg/Ca-temperature laboratory calibrations of Globigerinoides ruber in order to test the widely held assumptions that (1) seawater-test Mg/Ca co-vary linearly, and (2) the Mg/Ca-temperature sensitivity remains constant with changing Mg/Casw. We find a nonlinear Mg/Catest-Mg/Caswrelationship and a lowering of the Mg/Ca-temperature sensitivity at lower than modern Mg/Caswfrom 9.0{\%} °C-1at Mg/Casw= 5.2 mol mol-1to 7.5±0.9{\%}°C-1at 3.4 mol mol-1.

The process of ocean acidification is well documented in field data, and the rate will accelerate over this century unless future CO2 emissions are curbed dramatically. Acidification alters seawater chemical speciation and biogeochemical cycles of many elements and compounds. One well-known effect is the lowering of calcium carbonate saturation states, which impacts shell-forming marine organisms from plankton to benthic molluscs, echinoderms, and corals. Many calcifying species exhibit reduced calcification and growth rates in laboratory experiments under high-CO2 conditions. Ocean acidification also causes an increase in carbon fixation rates in some photosynthetic organisms (both calcifying and noncalcifying). The potential for marine organisms to adapt to increasing CO2 and broader implications for ocean ecosystems are not well known; both ...},

However, the concentration and speciation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) inside corals remain unclear, as only pH has been measured while a necessary second parameter to constrain carbonate chemistry has been missing. Here we report the first carbonate ion concentration ([CO3 2?]) measurements together with pH inside corals during the light period. We observe sharp increases in [CO3 2?] and pH from the gastric cavity to the calcifying fluid, confirming the existence of a proton (Hþ) pumping mechanism. We also show that corals can achieve a high aragonite saturation state (Oarag) in the calcifying fluid by elevating pH while at the same time keeping [DIC] low. Such a mechanism may require less Hþ-pumping and energy for upregulating pH compared with the high [DIC] scenario and thus may allow corals to be more resistant to climate change related stressors},

Many substances can traverse intermediate states before arriving at the stable phase. The apparent ubiquity of multi-step nucleation has made the inverse question relevant: does multistep nucleation always dominate single-step pathways? Here we provide an explicit example of the classical nucleation mechanism for a system known to exhibit the characteristics of multi-step nucleation. Molecular resolution atomic force microscopy imaging of the two-dimensional nucleation of the protein glucose isomerase demonstrates that the interior of subcritical clusters is in the same state as the crystalline bulk phase. Our data show that despite having all the characteristics typically associated with rich phase behaviour, glucose isomerase 2D crystals are formed classically. These observations illustrate the resurfacing importance of the classical nucleation theory by re-validating some of the key assumptions that have been recently questioned.},

Marine system responses to ocean acidification are complex and involve several mechanisms which impact a variety of marine processes and trophic interactions. Ecosystem evolution over the next decades will be driven by many factors including ocean acidification, climate change and modification to fishing pressures, pollution and eutrophication. It is proposed that a policy relevant ecosystem approach to ocean acidification requires a synergistic consideration of both the complexity of drivers and the complexity of responses, posing a significant challenge to existing model systems. Whilst current modelling approaches can make valuable contributions to predictive science, it is argued that developing methodologies including a hierarchy of simple and complex models and novel model paradigm, provides the optimal strategy for improving predictive capability. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The uptake of 45Ca, 3H-aspartic acid and 3H-thymidine was evaluated in isolated fractions including tissues, spicules and axes. Polyp number and distribution, axis weight and spicule type and size were also examined. The highest rates of uptake for all labeled materials were in the branch tips, indicating that the greatest degree of organic matrix formation, subsequent spicule formation and cell division occur in this apical region of the colony. Ca uptake decreased from the branch tips to the mid-portions of colonies, followed by an increase toward the bases. This latter rise in uptake is due to the increase in size and density of spicules which causes an increase in isotopic exchange. At branch junctions, the predominant cellular activity appears to be spicule formation vs. cell division. Axes of apical regions of branches displayed high rates of Ca uptake supporting its active role in the calcification process. The number and distribution of polyps, as well as spicule types, was variable among colonies indicating individual variability and/or the impact of varying environmental conditions. Data indicate that, although spicule formation occurs at its highest rate at branch tips, it occurs throughout the remainder of the colony as well. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {The Mg and Sr content of ostracod valves have been used to reconstruct past temperature and salinity, and their stable isotopes have been used to reveal aspects of marine, lake and estuary hydrology. However, significant uncertainties surround ostracod calcification processes, the incorporation mechanisms of trace elements, and the sensitivity of proxy tracers to complex confounding factors. The valves of most ostracods are composed of micron-scale crystalline grains embedded in an organic matrix. The fine-scale geochemistry of these structures, and the nature of the influence of biological mineralisation processes on valve chemistry, remain poorly constrained. We have performed sub-micron resolution X-ray microscopy of a marine Krithe ostracod valve, and determined the chemical coordination of Mg, and the distribution of Mg, Na and S throughout the crystal-organic valve structure. These trace elements display systematic sub-micron-scale compositional variations within the mineral grains and inter-granular matrix of the valve ultrastructure. These patterns imply that Krithe biomineralisation processes significantly modulate trace element incorporation at the sub-micron scale. Thus Krithe chemical composition is likely to be decoupled to some extent from the water in which they calcified. Most importantly, Mg K-edge Near-Edge X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectra, and the coincidence of high-Mg regions with S-rich organic layers reveal that Mg is not primarily hosted in the calcite structure in the valve. Our results highlight the need to understand the processes that drive this fine-scale chemical heterogeneity and their influence on connections between the external environment and valve geochemistry, if ostracods are to be used as sources of paleoenvironmental proxies.},

(1) uptake of both boron species assuming equilibrium with seawater 2. (2) preferential incorporation of B(OH)4- from in situ high-pH internal fluids of organisms that are isolated from seawater. The B content and ??11B values of deep-sea sediments, Foraminifera tests, and corals are used to estimate the global oceanic sink of elemental boron by calcium carbonate deposition. As a result of enrichment of B in corals, a substantially higher biogenic sink of 6.4 ?? 0.9 ?? 1010 g/yr is calculated for carbonates. This is only slightly lower than the sink for desorbable B in marine sediments (10 ?? 1010 g/yr) and approximately half that of altered oceanic crust (14 ?? 1010 g/yr). Thus, carbonates are an important sink for B in the oceans being {\~{}}20{\%} of the total sinks. The preferential incorporation of 10B into calcium carbonate results in oceanic 11B-enrichment, estimated as 1.2 ?? 0.3 ?? 1012 per mil ?? g/yr. The boron-isotope composition of authigenic, well-preserved carbonate skeletons may provide a useful tool to record secular boron-isotope variations in seawater at various times in the geological record. The potential use of boron-isotope geochemistry in skeletons as a tracer for palaeoenvironments is demonstrated in Ostracoda and Foraminifera from the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. The ??11B values of glacial-age, buried skeletons (4.0 and 4.9{\%}., respectively) are lower than that of their modern equivalents (17.6 and 13.3{\%}., respectively). This may reflect a "terrestrial" boron-isotope signature of the water in the gulf during the Late Quaternary when it was isolated from the ocean. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Accurate values of the apparent standard partial molal Gibbs free energies of formation ($\Delta$Ḡ°) of aqueous species, minerals, and gases at high temperatures and pressures are a requisite for characterizing a variety of industrial and natural processes including corrosion of metals, solvent extraction, crystal growth, metamorphism, and the formation of hydrothermal ore deposits. Revision of the HKF equations of state for aqueous species other than H2O (Helgeson, Kirkham and Flowers, 1981) by Tanger and Helgeson (1988) and Shock et al. (1992) permits calculation of $\Delta$Ḡ° for these species at temperatures to 1000 °C and pressures to 5000 bars. The revised equations of state were combined with parameters generated by Shock and Helgeson (1988, 1990), Shock and McKinnon (1993), Shock and Koretsky (1993), Schulte and Shock (1993), Pokrovskii and Helgeson (1995 a, b, and c), and Sverjensky et al. (1995) together with densities and electrostatic properties of H2O computed from equations summarized by Johnson and Norton (1991) to calculate values of $\Delta$Ḡ° for aqueous species as a function of temperature and pressure. The results of these calculations are tabulated for 348 such species, including both inorganic and organic aqueous ions, neutral species, and metal ligand complexes. Similar calculations using equations, parameters, and thermodynamic data taken from Kelley (1960), Helgeson {\textless}etal (1978), Wagman {\textgreater}et al. (1982), Hill (1990), Shock (1993), and Pokrovskii and Helgeson (1995 a and b) were used to generate tables of $\Delta$Ḡ° for H2O, 22 minerals, and 18 gases. The tabulated values of $\Delta$Ḡ°, which were generated with the aid of SUPCRT92 (Johnson et al., 1992), facilitate considerably assessment of the thermodynamic behavior of chemical processes at both high and low temperatures and pressures.},

abstract = {The FT-infrared absorption spectrum of the hydrogen-bonded acetonewater complex has been investigated in solid argon matrices. Acetone and water vapors were co-condensed with an excess of argon gas at 12 K, giving rise to red- or blue-shifted absorptions near most of those associated with the fundamental transitions of matrix-isolated acetone or water. Vibrational shifts are indicative of a 1:l complex of acetone and water, in which water is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of acetone. Accordingly, red shifts are observed for the C=O stretching mode of acetone and the 0-H stretching modes of water. Corresponding shifts of similar magnitude were observed when {\&}-acetone was used. Ab initio SCF computations of the equilibrium structure and fundamental vibrational frequencies indicate a cyclic hydrogen-bonded structure involving interactions between water and acetone at both the carbonyl oxygen and one methyl hydrogen. Changes in the net charges and bond orders upon formation of the complex are as would be expected for the early stages of a water-catalyzed keto-enol transformation. Predicted frequency shifts were found to be in excellent agreement with most of the observed complex vibrational frequency shifts, when the 6-3 1G** basis set was employed. The influence of hydrogen bonding on the structure, electronic distribution, and vibrational frequencies of acetone and water is discussed.},

abstract = {Recent measurements of surface coccolithophore calcification from the Atlantic Ocean (50??N-50??S) are compared to similar measurements from other oceanic settings. By combining the different data sets of surface measurements, we examine general and regional patterns of calcification relative to organic carbon production (photosynthesis) and other characteristics of the phytoplankton community. Generally, surface calcification and photosynthesis are positively correlated, although the strength of the relationship differs between biogeochemical provinces. Relationships between surface calcification, chlorophyll-a and calcite concentrations are also statistically significant, although again there is considerable regional variability. Such variability appears unrelated to phytoplankton community composition or hydrographic conditions, and may instead reflect variations in coccolithophore physiology. The contribution of inorganic carbon fixation (calcification) to total carbon fixation (calcification plus photosynthesis) is ???1-10{\%}, and we estimate a similar contribution from coccolithophores to total organic carbon fixation. However, these contributions vary between biogeochemical provinces, and occasionally coccolithophores may account for {\textgreater}20{\%} of total carbon fixation in unproductive central subtropical gyres. Combining surface calcification and photosynthetic rates with standing stocks of calcite, particulate organic carbon, and estimated phytoplankton carbon allows us to examine the fates of these three carbon pools. The relative turnover times vary between different biogeochemical provinces, with no clear relationship to the overall productivity or phytoplankton community structure found in each province. Rather, interaction between coccolithophore physiology (coccolith production and detachment rates), species diversity (cell size), and food web dynamics (grazer ecology) may control the composition and turnover times of calcite particles in the upper ocean. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Algae are important primary colonizers of snow and glacial ice, but hitherto little is known about their ecology on Iceland's glaciers and ice caps. Due do the close proximity of active volcanoes delivering large amounts of ash and dust, they are special ecosystems. This study provides the first investigation of the presence and diversity of microbial communities on all major Icelandic glaciers and ice caps over a 3 year period. Using high-throughput sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal RNA genes (16S and 18S), we assessed the snow community structure and complemented these analyses with a comprehensive suite of physical-, geo-, and biochemical characterizations of the aqueous and solid components contained in snow and ice samples. Our data reveal that a limited number of snow algal taxa (Chloromonas polyptera, Raphidonema sempervirens and two uncultured Chlamydomonadaceae) support a rich community comprising of other micro-eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacterial phyla. Archaea were also detected in sites where snow algae dominated and they mainly belong to the Nitrososphaerales, which are known as important ammonia oxidizers. Multivariate analyses indicated no relationships between nutrient data and microbial community structure. However, the aqueous geochemical simulations suggest that the microbial communities were not nutrient limited because of the equilibrium of snow with the nutrient-rich and fast dissolving volcanic ash. Increasing algal secondary carotenoid contents in the last stages of the melt seasons have previously been associated with a decrease in surface albedo, which in turn could potentially have an impact on the melt rates of Icelandic glaciers.},

abstract = {The algal osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is recognised as the major precursor of marine dimethylsulfide (DMS), a volatile sulfur compound that affects atmospheric chemistry and global climate. Recent studies, using 35S-DMSP tracer techniques, suggest that DMSP may play additional very important roles in the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of the surface ocean. DMSP may serve as an intracellular osmolyte in bacteria that take up phytoplankton-derived DMSP from seawater. In addition, DMSP appears to support from 1 to 13{\%} of the bacterial carbon demand in surface waters, making it one of the most significant single substrates for bacterioplankton so far identified. Furthermore, the sulfur from DMSP is efficiently incorporated into bacterial proteins (mostly into methionine) and DMSP appears to be a major source of sulfur for marine bacterioplankton. Assimilatory metabolism of DMSP is via methanethiol (MESH) that is produced by a demethylation/ demethiolation pathway which dominates DMSP degradation in situ. Based on the linkage between assimilatory metabolism of DMSP and bacterial growth, we offer a hypothesis whereby DMSP availability to bacteria controls the production of DMS by the competing DMSP lyase pathway. Also linked with the assimilatory metabolism of DMSP is the production of excess MeSH which, if not assimilated into protein, reacts to form dissolved non-volatile compounds. These include sulfate and DOM-metal-MeSH complexes, both of which represent major short-term end-products of DMSP degradation. Because production rates of MeSH in seawater are high (3-90 nM d-1), reaction of MeSH with trace metals could affect metal availability and chemistry in seawater. Overall, results of recent studies provide evidence that DMSP plays important roles in the carbon, sulfur and perhaps metal and DOM cycles in marine microbial communities. These findings, coupled with the fact that the small fraction of DMSP converted to DMS may influence atmospheric chemistry and climate dynamics, draws attention to DMSP as a molecule of central importance to marine biogeochemical and ecological processes.

abstract = {Cystoliths are amorphous calcium carbonate bodies that form in the leaves of some plant families. Cystoliths are regularly distributed in the epidermis and protrude into the photosynthetic tissue, the mesophyll. The photosynthetic pigments generate a steep light gradient in the leaf. Under most illumination regimes the outer mesophyll is light saturated, thus the photosynthetic apparatus is kinetically unable to use the excess light for photochemistry. Here we use micro-scale modulated fluorometry to demonstrate that light scattered by the cystoliths is distributed from the photosynthetically inefficient upper tissue to the efficient, but light deprived, lower tissue. The results prove that the presence of light scatterers reduces the steep light gradient, thus enabling the leaf to use the incoming light flux more efficiently. MicroCT and electron microscopy confirm that the spatial distribution of the minerals is compatible with their optical function. During the study we encountered large calcium oxalate druses in the same anatomical location as the cystoliths. These druses proved to have similar light scattering functions as the cystoliths. This study shows that certain minerals in the leaves of different plants distribute the light flux more evenly inside the leaf.},

The vaterite preparate used consisted of spherulites of vaterite crystals with initial radii of 2.7 to 4.6 mu m. The progress of the dissolution was followed by recording pH as a function of time. From pH the concentration of the dissolved matter was calculated, and from this we found the particle size, r, and the dissolution rate, -dr/dt, where r = average particle radius and t = time. Straight lines were obtained by plotting -r(dr/dt) as a function of undersaturation, c(S)-c, which may be explained by diffusional rate control. Both the values of the apparent diffusion coefficients determined and their dependence on temperature (activation energy = 24.38 kJ/mol) support the assumption that the rate-determining process for the dissolution is the diffusion of the hydrated calcium and carbonate ions away from the crystal surface into the bulk solution.},

abstract = {Perforations ("punctae") are one of the most characteristic morphological shell features in calcite brachiopods. The significance of punctae is that they represent discontinuities in shell biomineralisation and thus add a level of complexity that must be accounted for in any model of brachiopod shell formation. A significant hindrance to understanding punctae growth and formation is the absence of sufficient information on volume, size and density. Here, we use synchrotron-radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) to obtain three-dimensional information about punctae of five species of calcite brachiopods. X-ray tomography shows that punctae morphology is species-specific and reveals previously unknown levels of complexity for each species. This information is combined with previous data on morphology to discuss the function and growth of punctae. Overall the present study demonstrates the need to increase our understanding of discontinuities and the role of cell biology in the context of biomineralisation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, as water enters the polymer (unzipping the chain-chain hydrogen bonding), conversion to a 'gel' is rapid and the crystallinity drops concurrently. A Fickian-like model then becomes viable at intermediate times. FTIR-ATR is an excellent technique with which to study sorption from solvent mixtures. In this case, for example, we have demonstrated that acetone does not enter a dry polymer film and that the micro-crystallinity of the PVOH returns at longer times. Neither of these two potentially important results could have been obtained using gravimetric methods. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The concentrations of Sr, Mg and other elements in calcite are widely used to infer the conditions of mineral growth. However, such inferences are dependent on the mechanisms that govern the incorporation of minor constituents into the calcite lattice during growth. A particularly confusing observation is that both Sr and Mg are readily incorporated into growing calcite crystals at low concentrations but inhibit calcite growth at higher concentrations. Here we show that the growth rate dependence of Sr and Mg incorporation into calcite, as well the inhibitory effects on calcite growth of both incorporating and non-incorporating ions, can be predicted with an ion-by-ion crystal growth model where ion attachment is confined to kink sites on the crystal surface.The exchange of ions between active growth (kink) sites on the mineral surface and aqueous solution governs both the efficiency of incorporation of minor constituents and the kinetics of mineral precipitation. Ions such as Sr and Mg in calcite, that are not stoichiometric constituents, may attach to kink sites and impede crystal growth by either blocking propagation of the kink (kink blocking), or if incorporated into the growing mineral, straining the local crystal lattice, and hence increasing the mineral solubility (incorporation inhibition). Here we investigate the effects of including these growth inhibition mechanisms into a microscopic model for crystal growth based on kink creation, propagation and collision (CPC) theory. This model predicts that kink blocking by either incorporated or non-incorporated ions causes an exponential decrease in mineral growth rate with increasing impurity concentration, while incorporation inhibition results in more complicated functional forms of the growth rate effect depending on the thermodynamics of the solid solution. Applying this model to existing data on the partitioning of strontium and magnesium into calcite and the simultaneous effects on growth kinetics and mineral composition, we find that strontium uptake inhibits growth by enhancing mineral solubility while magnesium inhibits growth primarily by kink blocking. Our model should be widely applicable to understanding the impurity content of a large range of sparingly soluble minerals that form by precipitation from aqueous solutions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {While many studies have demonstrated that organic farms support greater levels of biodiversity, it is not known whether this translates into better provision of ecosystem services. Here we use a food-web approach to analyse the community structure and function at the whole-farm scale. Quantitative food webs from 10 replicate pairs of organic and conventional farms showed that organic farms have significantly more species at three trophic levels (plant, herbivore and parasitoid) and significantly different network structure. Herbivores on organic farms were attacked by more parasitoid species on organic farms than on conventional farms. However, differences in network structure did not translate into differences in robustness to simulated species loss and we found no difference in percentage parasitism (natural pest control) across a variety of host species. Furthermore, a manipulative field experiment demonstrated that the higher species richness of parasitoids on the organic farms did not increase mortality of a novel herbivore used to bioassay ecosystem service. The explanation for these differences is likely to include inherent differences in management strategies and landscape structure between the two farming systems.},

In the dark, the foraminiferan respiration lowered the O sub(2) concentration at the shell surface to 50{\%} of air saturation, while pH was lowered from the ambient value of 8.23 to 8.15. In the light, the O sub(2) increased to 2.5 times air saturation while pH reached 8.62. Photosynthetic rates were mapped around and within the animal. The high net photosynthesis showed that the zooxanthellae could theoretically provide all organic carbon required for growth and respiration of the host. Model calculations indicated, however, that the foraminifera were diffusion-limited in the uptake of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus. The capture of prey was therefore a necessary source of these nutrients, while symbiotic photosynthesis could cover the energy requirements and allow efficient internal recycling of nutrients},

abstract = {Estimates of coccolith volume help in determining total coccolith carbonate fluxes and the relative contributions of various coccolith species. It is argued here that the best approach to deriving such coccolith volumes is to calculate shape factors, k(s), for each species separately based on reconstruction of cross profiles and to determine mean sizes from measurement of size variation in the sample of interest. Then volume = k(s)l3. Values of k(s) are given for the most important extant coccolith species based on reconstruction of cross-sections, followed by calculation of a volume of rotation using an iterative routine implemented in an image analysis package. Substantial errors, ca. 50{\%}, are inevitable in such calculations, but the resultant data are nonetheless of value. Coccolith assemblages from North Atlantic (47 °N 20 °W) JGOFS 1989 sediment trap samples are analysed as a test case; calculated coccolith PIC fluxes constitute 30-80{\%} of the chemically determined total PIC fluxes.

Conventional sample preparation methods usually involve dehydration, which removes cellular water and may consequently cause structural collapse, or invasive processes such as embedding. Radiation-induced artifacts may also become an issue, particularly as the spatial resolution increases beyond the sub-micrometer scale. To allow imaging under hydrated conditions, close to the `natural state', as well as to reduce structural radiation damage, the Bionanoprobe (BNP) has been developed, a hard X-ray fluorescence nanoprobe with cryogenic sample environment and cryo transfer capabilities, dedicated to studying trace elements in frozen-hydrated biological systems. The BNP is installed at an undulator beamline at sector 21 of the Advanced Photon Source. It provides a spatial resolution of 30 nm for two-dimensional fluorescence imaging. In this first demonstration the instrument design and motion control principles are described, the instrument performance is quantified, and the first results obtained with the BNP on frozen-hydrated whole cells are reported.},

abstract = {opaque-2 (o2) is a regulatory locus in maize that plays an essential role in controlling the expression of genes encoding the 22-kD zein proteins. Through DNase I footprinting and DNA binding analyses, we have identified the binding site for the O2 protein (O2) in the promoter of 22-kD zein genes. The sequence in the 22-kD zein gene promoter that is recognized by O2 is similar to the target site recognized by other "basic/leucine zipper" (bZIP) proteins in that it contains an ACGT core that is necessary for DNA binding. The site is located in the -300 region relative to the translation start and lies about 20 bp downstream of the highly conserved zein gene sequence motif known as the "prolamin box." Employing gel mobility shift assays, we used O2 antibodies and nuclear extracts from an o2 null mutant to demonstrate that the O2 protein in maize endosperm nuclei recognizes the target site in the zein gene promoter. Mobility shift assays using nuclear proteins from an o2 null mutant indicated that other endosperm proteins in addition to O2 can bind the O2 target site and that O2 may be associated with one of these proteins. We also demonstrated that in yeast cells the O2 protein can activate expression of a lacZ gene containing a multimer of the O2 target sequence as part of its promoter, thus confirming its role as a transcriptional activator. A computer-assisted search indicated that the O2 target site is not present in the promoters of zein genes other than those of the 22-kD class. These data suggest a likely explanation at the molecular level for the differential effect of o2 mutations on expression of certain members of the zein gene family.},

abstract = {Copepod faecal pellets have often been considered as rapid transporters of material out of the euphotic zone. Laboratory experiments on their degradation and sinking rates support this view, but field data on the distribution and flux of pellets through the water column present contradictory evidence. We suggest that due to the exclusion of metazoans from previously published degradation experiments, such studies may have little relevance to the natural environments. In 1987/1988 we carried out experiments using adult copepods of mixed species but dominated by Centropages hamatus collected in Kiel Bight (FRG). We have demonstrated that copepods can be highly adept at breaking up their own pellets while ingesting only a small proportion, a behaviour we define as 'coprorhexy'. The microbiota is probably unable to cause significant modification to faecal pellets before they are fragmented within a few hours of their production. Thereafter, microbial remineralisation will become important. Many of the 'difficult' field data can be readily explained if the process of coprorhexy is taken into account and, indeed, breakage of large particles by crustacean zooplankton may be an important process in modifying material transport in the ocean. Copepods appear to perform coprorhexy by removing the peritrophic membrane with its attached bacterial flora and this may then be ingested. We speculate on the nutritional value of such a behaviour and the possible significance of 'ghost' pellets, consisting of a membrane with little or no apparent solid content},

This has major implications for the future of the high-Mg calcite producing organisms within coral reef ecosystems. In order to understand any potential buffering system offered by the dissolution of carbonate sediments under a lower oceanic pH, this process of high-Mg calcite dissolution in the reef environment must be further elucidated.},

Samples have been analyzed using a 43 Ca-48 Ca double spike and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). In order to avoid species-dependent isotope fractionation we focused our investigations on a single foraminifera species (Globigerinoides sacculifer), which is known to inhabit shallow euphotic waters in tropical and subtropical oceans. Ca isotope measurements were performed on cultured G. sacculifer that grew in seawater kept at temperatures of 19.58, 26.58, and 29.58C. A d 44 Ca change of 0.24  0.02 per 18C is defined by the weighted linear regression through reproduced d 44 Ca data of the three temperatures (95{\%} confidence level). Application of this new method to fossil G. sacculifer of an Equatorial East Atlantic sediment core (GeoB1112; 5846.7 H S, 10845.0 H W, 3125 m) indicates that the d 44 Ca difference between marine isotope stage 1 (MIS-1) and MIS-2 is 0.71  0.24.

abstract = {We present a new, simple technique for the rapid and precise determination of boron (11B10B) and chlorine (37Cl35Cl) isotopic compositions in some natural materials (e.g., seawater, hypersaline brines, groundwater and calcium carbonate). The high reactivity of B and Cl enables production of BO2- and Cl- ions directly from untreated solutions which are analysed by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry. The high sensitivity of the negative ions allows trace amounts of B and Cl, with concentrations as low as 0.06 and 40 ppm, respectively, to be directly analysed in natural samples with a precision of ??? ??2??? for both B and Cl (at the 95{\%} confidence limit). In the case of boron, samples were analysed with and without chemical separation and no difference in isotopic ratios was found within the experimental error. Isotope-dilution mass spectrometry using enriched 10B has also been successfully applied to the quantitative analysis of the B contents of natural samples at trace levels. These methods have been tested on a variety of geological materials including seawater, groundwater, hypersaline brines, water-soluble salts and HCl-soluble minerals and have been found to be applicable to a wide range of water salinities and chemistries. The geochemical application of B and Cl isotope systematics is discussed and illustrated using examples of terrestrial waters and evaporites from Australia, China and Israel. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that secular variation in the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater throughout the Phanerozoic would have subjected the aragonite-producing codiacean algae to at least three transitions between the low-Mg calcite (molar Mg/Ca 2) and aragonite  high-Mg calcite (molar Mg/Ca2) nucleation fields in the oceans, since their origin in the Ordovician. These studies have asserted that major sediment production by codiacean algae in Recent tropical seas is permitted by the Mg/Ca ratio of modern seawater (molar Mg/Ca 5.2) remaining within the aragonitic/high-Mg calcite nucleation field (molar Mg/Ca 2). Here I present the results of ex- periments conducted to determine the effects of ambient Mg/Ca on the mineralogy, growth rate, primary productivity, calcification rate, and biomechanics of the codiacean alga Penicillus capitatus. P. capitatus specimens were grown in three artificial seawater treatments that mimic ancient sea- water of differing Mg/Ca ratios, corresponding to the low-Mg calcite nucleation field (molarMg/ Ca 1.0), a ‘‘boundary field'' (molar Mg/Ca 2.5), and the aragonite high-Mg calcite nucleation field (molar Mg/Ca 5.2). Significantly, P. capitatus specimens maintained amostly aragonitic min- eralogy in all three seawater treatments. However, linear growth rates, primary productivity, cal- cification, and thallus stiffness decreased with reductions in ambient Mg/Ca. That P. capitatus pre- cipitates approximately three-quarters of its CaCO3 as aragonite in the seawater treatment that fa- vors the inorganic precipitation of low-Mg calcite suggests that the alga dictates the precipitation of that polymorph, either by pumping cations to create an internal aragonite nucleation field (molar Mg/Ca 2) or by employing organic templates that specify the nucleation of the aragonite poly- morph (Borowitzka 1984). However, the alga's precipitation of one-quarter of its CaCO3 as low-Mg calcite suggests that its mineralogical control is limited and can be partially overridden by the Mg/ Ca ratio of ambient seawater. The reduced calcification of P. capitatus specimens grown in the low- Mg calcite and boundary nucleation fields is probably due to the inherent difficulty of precipitating aragonite from seawater which does not naturally support its nucleation. The decreased rates of linear growth and primary production are probably caused by reductions in CO2 available for pho- tosynthesis due to the reduction in calcification (Borowitzka and Larkum 1977). The observed de- crease in thallus stiffness is probably due to the reductions in calcification and primary productiv- ity observed in P. capitatus specimens grown in the low-Mg calcite and boundary nucleation fields. The present study suggests that aragonitic algae would have been handicapped in oceans char- acterized by Mg/Ca ratios that did not support their inherent mineralogy. Producing aragonite in seawater outside of the aragonite  high-Mg calcite nucleation field would probably have reduced the competitiveness of these algae, made them more susceptible to predation, and reduced their contribution to carbonate sedimentation. These findings support earlier assertions that the domi- nant ecological and sedimentological roles of codiacean algae in Recent tropical seas is permitted by a Mg/Ca ratio of seawater that supports the algae's aragonitic mineralogy during this time.},

abstract = {It has been hypothesized that phosphate limitation classically indicated by NO3:PO4 ratios {\textgreater} 16, is one of the critical factors allowing the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi to bloom. This hypothesis is based on physiological studies showing that E. huxleyi has an exceptionally high affinity for orthophosphate and is able to use organic phosphate. Indeed, E. huxleyi has been found to bloom at high NO3: PO4 ratios in some mesocosm studies and in the oceanic northeast North Atlantic. Recent E. huxleyi blooms on the southeastern Bering Sea shelf, however, occurred under low NO3: PO4 conditions, which is indicative of nitrogen rather than phosphorus stress. A review of field studies of blooms where nitrate and phosphate were measured indicates that NO3: PO4 was in fact frequently low. A survey of most of the areas of the world ocean where satellite-detected E. huxleyi blooms occur also shows that NO3:PO4 ratios are generally low. These observations suggest that E. huxleyi is able to exploit situations where either phosphorus or nitrogen is limiting to competing species. They also indicate that attention should be directed to examining organic nitrogen, organic phosphorus, and ammonium during E. huxleyi blooms to better understand the role macronutrients play in these blooms.},

abstract = {Comprehensive, aggregate nutrient budgets were established for two compartments of the North Sea, the shallow coastal and deeper open regions, and for three different periods, representing pre-eutrophication (???1950), eutrophication (???1990) and contemporary (???2000) phases. The aim was to quantify the major budget components, to identify their sources of variability, to specify the anthropogenic components, and to draw implications for past and future policy. For all three periods, open North Sea budgets were dominated (75{\%}) by fluxes from and to the North-East Atlantic; sediment exchange was of secondary importance (18{\%}). For the coastal North Sea, fluxes during the eutrophication period were dominated by sediment exchange (49{\%} of all inputs), followed by exchange with the open sea (21{\%}), and anthropogenic inputs (19{\%}). Between 1950 and 1990, N-loading of coastal waters increased by a factor of 1.62 and P-loading by 1.45. These loads declined after 1990. Interannual variability in Atlantic inflow was found to correspond to a variability of 11{\%} in nutrient load to the open North Sea. Area-specific external loads of both the open and coastal North Sea were below Vollenweider-type critical loads when expressed relative to depth and flushing. External area-specific load of the coastal North Sea has declined since 1990 from 1.8 to about 1.4 g P m-2 y-1 in 2000, which is close to the estimate of 1.3 for 1950. N-load declined less, leading to an increase in N/P ratio. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To test its potential to improve our understanding of trace element distribution in foraminifera shells, we mapped the Mg distribution across individual chambers of the planktonic species Globigerinoides ruber. G. ruber shells were picked from equatorial Atlantic surface sediments (Sierra Leone Rise). They ranged from well-preserved to heavily dissolved tests. The mapping of trace elements across test chambers made it possible to discriminate between variability inherent to the shell material and heterogeneity linked to contaminant phases. Contaminating mineral phases were characterized by high Mg concentrations (Mg/Ca = 19.7 mmol/mol) and high levels of Si, Al, and Fe. Mg/Ca values of well-preserved shells ranged from 3.9 to 4.5 mmol/mol. The Mg to Ca ratios of partially dissolved shells varied between 1.8 and 3.4 mmol/mol between outer and inner chambers. Low and homogeneous Mg/Ca values of 2.0 and 2.3 mmol/mol were determined for chambers of a severely dissolved test.},

Aqueous Mg concentration maximized after approximately 2years time at 3??10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-5{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}mol/kg, whereas aqueous Si concentrations increased continuously with time, reaching 2??10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-5{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}mol/kg after 5years. Element release rates closely matched those determined on this same forsterite sample during short-term abiotic open system experiments for the first 10days, then slowed substantially such that the Mg and Si release rates are approximately an order of magnitude slower than that calculated from the short-term abiotic experiments. Post-experiment analysis reveals that secondary hematite, a substantial biotic community, and minor amorphous silica formed on the dissolving forsterite during the experiment. The biotic community included bacteria, dominated by Rhizobiales (Alphaproteobacteria), and fungi, dominated by Trichocomaceae, that grew in a carbon and nutrient-limited media on the dissolving forsterite. The Mg isotope composition of the reactive fluid was near constant after 2years but 0.25??? heavier in ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}26{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Mg than the dissolving forsterite.

abstract = {A convolution approach to X-ray powder line-profile fitting is developed in which the line shape is synthesized from the Cu K[alpha] emission profile, the dimensions of the diffractometer and the physical variables of the specimen. In addition to the integrated intensities and 2[theta] positions of the line profiles, the parameters that may be fitted include the receiving-slit width, the receiving-slit length, the X-ray-source size, the angle of divergence of the incident beam, the X-ray attenuation coefficient of the specimen and the crystallite size. This is a self-consistent approach to fitting as the instrumental parameters are usually known by direct measurement. To minimize correlation between refined instrumental parameters, profiles at high and low 2[theta] values should be fitted simultaneously. The Cu K[alpha] emission profile used in this work is based on recent monolithic double-crystal spectrometer measurements that have identified a doublet structure in both the K[alpha]1 and K[alpha]2 components. Fast and accurate convolution procedures have been developed and a mixture of multilinear regression and Gauss-Newton non-linear least squares with numerical differentials is used for fitting the profiles. The method is evaluated by fitting powder diffraction data from well crystallized specimens of MgO and Y3Al5O12 (YAG). Testing has also been carried out by examining the changes in the fitted values after altering various instrumental parameters (e.g. receiving-slit width, detector defocus, receiving-slit length and inclusion of a monochromator).},

Here, we describe the application of synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) to document the ontogenetic history of the foraminifers Globigerinoides sacculifer and Globorotalia menardii. Our SRXTM scans permit resolution at submicrometre scale, thereby displaying additional internal structures such as pores, dissolution patterns and complexity of the wall growth. Our methods provide a powerful tool to pick apart the developmental history of these microfossils and subsequently assist in inferring phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary processes.},

Survival of larval cod is shown to depend on three key biological parameters of their prey: the mean size of prey, seasonal timing and abundance. We suggest a mechanism, involving the match/mismatch hypothesis, by which variability in temperature affects larval cod survival and conclude that rising temperature since the mid-1980s has modified the plankton ecosystem in a way that reduces the survival of young cod.},

abstract = {Bovine hypodermosis affecting livestock performance and the leather industry was still widespread in France up to the nineties despite successive directives from the Ministry of Agriculture since 1941, encouraging livestock owners to treat, on a voluntary basis. In 1969 the French Ministry of Agriculture, asked the national Farmers' Animal Health Organisation (FAHO), to plan a durable hypodermosis control programme and a working group including all the partners in cattle production was set up, under the coordination of the national FAHO. Improved systems of hypodermosis control, including new treatment and surveillance methods were developed. Among the main benefits obtained from this original work, were (i) the identification of scientific data which allowed inexpensive and accurate immuno-surveillance procedures, and a highly effective low-cost treatment, Ivomec{\textregistered}, administered at the micro dose rate (2 $\mu$g/kg), which is environmentally non-threatening, and (ii) the development of a new strategy to manage the control programmes progressively, on a regional basis, in two to three concentric zones over three successive years at a maximum. The current programme, coordinated at the National level since 1998, has been implemented in each region of France. The compulsory systemic winter treatments directed against the endo-parasitic stage, carried out by technicians and veterinarians involved the entire bovine population in controlled zones. As each zone reached a hypodermosis herd prevalence of under 5{\%}, usually after two years, the treatments were suspended. However treatments of the infected farms and contiguous farms were maintained. An immuno-survey was carried out, each winter, to evaluate the prevalence of the disease and detect any residual foci or re-infestations. Since 2002, bovine hypodermosis in France is under control with immuno-surveillance maintained at a very low cost. In 2006 hypodermosis became a notifiable disease. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {It has already been extensively documented that major floristic differences between ancient and recent temperate broad-leaved forests exist. Hence, the question raises whether the herb layer community structure and organization of ancient and recent forests also differs and whether these differences are the same in productive vs. unproductive forest types? Therefore, we selected 127 releves situated in productive Alno-Padion forests and 69 releves situated in less productive Quercion forests out of a larger data-set containing 640 releves from northern Belgium. The plots differed with respect to land use history but it was assured that no covariation between land use history on the one hand, and soil texture, soil drainage and canopy composition on the other occurred. In both forest types, about 30{\%} of the studied species exhibited an association with either ancient or recent forests. Persistent differences between ancient and recent forests in life-form spectra in general and in the number and abundance of geophytes in particular were found as well. Few changes in the community structure of productive Alno-Padion forests were observed after 70 years of recovery. Only in the youngest Alno-Padion forests (i.e. {\textless} 70 years) species numbers and total cover of the herb layer were lower and co-occurrence patterns did not differ from random. In general, community recovery appeared to be slower in unproductive Quercion forests. Species numbers, species abundance distributions, species co-occurrence patterns and plot dissimilarity still changed after 120 years. The persistent differences in both communities can be explained by the strong dispersal limitation of many of the involved species, but in the Quercion forests recovery is probably also severely hampered by establishment limitation.},

abstract = {If published estimates of SO2 volatilization and NO(x) generation by the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) impact were atmospherically converted to sulfuric and nitric acid, globally dispersed, and rapidly rained out, the resulting acid concentrations would bracket a critical threshold in surface-ocean chemistry. Rapid and globally uniform deposition of masses corresponding to the lowest estimates would have had no major effect on sea-surface chemistry. However, similar deposition of masses corresponding to the highest estimates would have provided enough acid to destroy the carbonate-buffering capacity of the upper 100 m of the world ocean and catastrophically reduce surface-ocean pH. Despite the possible effect of the highest estimated acid yields, scenarios that rely on acid rain as the primary explanation of global K-T extinctions are not readily compatible with K-T records of terrestrial and marine survival or culturing studies of modern marine plankton. The possibility that acid rain was a primary cause of K-T extinctions can be tested further by analysis of geographic variation in extinction intensity, because such variation was a likely consequence if the impact resulted in global dispersal and rapid globally uniform deposition of more than approximately 6 x 10(16) mol of H2SO4 or 1.2 x 10(17) mol of HNO3.},

abstract = {Microbial processes are now perceived to be an important component of the marine food chain. Mathematical models present a quantitative means of analysing interspecies interactions within food webs. Although detailed models of individual components of the microbial food web (bacteria, phytoplankton, protozoan predators) have been derived, their incorporation into large-scale food web models has yet to become commonplace. Current models have confirmed the general importance of microbial food webs and that the specific inclusion of protozoan predators in models is often necessary to simulate the observed dynamics. Simulations have indicated that the effect of the microbial food web on the food chain may vary greatly depending on imposed physical or biological conditions. The manner in which nutrient regeneration from protozoan predators and its subsequent reutilisation by bacteria and phytoplankton is simulated is an important consideration. Models employ equations of varying sophistication, but detailed recent formulations use a dual model currency of C and N. Models have also increased our understanding of the interaction between grazing and nutrient cycling and the different behaviour of food chains and webs.},

@article{Lemarchand2004,
abstract = {The isotopic composition of Ca ($\Delta$44Ca/40Ca) in calcite crystals has been determined relative to that in the parent solutions by TIMS using a double spike. Solutions were exposed to an atmosphere of NH3 and CO2, provided by the decomposition of (NH4)2CO3, following the procedure developed by previous workers. Alkalinity, pH and concentrations of CO32-, HCO3-, and CO2 in solution were determined. The procedures permitted us to determine $\Delta$(44Ca/40Ca) over a range of pH conditions, with the associated ranges of alkalinity. Two solutions with greatly different Ca concentrations were used, but, in all cases, the condition [Ca2+]{\textgreater}{\textgreater}[CO32-] was met. A wide range in $\Delta$(44Ca/40Ca) was found for the calcite crystals, extending from 0.04 ± 0.13‰ to - 1.34 ± 0.15‰, generally anti-correlating with the amount of Ca removed from the solution. The results show that $\Delta$(44Ca/40Ca) is a linear function of the saturation state of the solution with respect to calcite ($\Omega$). The two parameters are very well correlated over a wide range in $\Omega$ for each solution with a given [Ca]. The linear correlation extended from $\Delta$(44Ca/40Ca) = -1.34 ± 0.15‰ to 0.04 ± 0.13‰, with the slopes directly dependent on [Ca]. Solutions, which were vigorously stirred, showed a much smaller range in $\Delta$(44Ca/40Ca) and gave values of -0.42 ± 0.14‰, with the largest effect at low $\Omega$ It is concluded that the diffusive flow of CO32- into the immediate neighborhood of the crystal-solution interface is the rate-controlling mechanism and that diffusive transport of Ca2+; is not a significant factor. The data are simply explained by the assumptions that: a) the immediate interface of the crystal and the solution is at equilibrium with $\Delta$(44 Ca/40Ca) ∼ -1.5 ± 0.2‰; and b) diffusive inflow of CO3-2 causes supersaturation, thus precipitating Ca from the regions exterior to the narrow zone of equilibrium. The result is that $\Delta$(44Ca/40Ca) is a monotonically increasing (from negative values to zero) function of $\Omega$. We consider this model to be a plausible explanation of most of the available data reported in the literature. The well-resolved but small and regular isotope fractionation shifts in Ca are thus not related to the diffusion of very large hydrated Ca complexes, but rather due to the ready availability of Ca in the general neighborhood of the crystal-solution interface. The largest isotopic shift which occurs as a small equilibrium effect is then subdued by supersaturation precipitation for solutions where [Ca2+{\textgreater}{\textgreater} [CO32-] + [HCO3-]. It is shown that there is a clear temperature dependence of the net isotopic shifts that is simply due to changes in $\Omega$ due to the equilibrium "constants" dependence on temperature, which changes the degree of saturation and hence the amount of isotopically unequilibrated Ca precipitated. The effects that are found in natural samples, therefore, will be dependent on the degree of diffusive inflow of carbonate species at or around the crystal-liquid interface in the particular precipitating system, thus limiting the equilibrium effect. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

Increased spatial resolution is achieved using cone-beam geometry. The almost parallel beam is focused with a Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system. The focal spot serves as a diverging secondary source. An X-ray magnified image of the sample is projected on the detector. For imaging and tomography with sub-100 nm resolution, an X-ray full-field microscope has been built. It uses a Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror (KB) as a condenser optic, followed by a micro-Fresnel zone plate (FZP) as an objective lens. The zone plates presently provide 50-85 nm spatial resolution when operating the microscope with photon energy between 6 and 12 keV.

abstract = {Zinc is used extensively in the metabolism of higher organisms; cobalt's usage is minimal. We found an unusual pattern of requirement for these metals in marine phytoplankton in which the cyanobacterium Synechococcus bacillaris needed Co but not Zn for growth, the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi had a Co requirement that could be partly met by Zn, and the diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and Thalassiosira oceanica had Zn requirements that could be largely met by Co. These result indicate that Co and Zn can replace one another metabolically in the eucaryotic species. Associated with this replacement, there was up to a 700-fold increase in cellular Co uptake rates with decreasing Zn ion concentration, indicating that Zn should have a major influence on biological scavenging fo Co. This hypothesis is consistent with Zn and Co distributions within the oceanic nutricline which show Co depletion only after Zn has become depleted. Zn ion concentrations and Co:Zn ratios vary widely in the ocean, and these variations could influence the relative growth of diatoms and coccolithophores, with pothential effects on global carbon cycles.},

abstract = {Planktic foraminifers are marine protozoans with calcareous shells and chambered tests. They first ap- peared in the mid-Jurassic and spread since the mid-Cretaceous over all the world's oceans. Modern planktic fo- raminifers evolved since the early Tertiary, when the first spinose species occurred. Most species live in the surface to sub-thermocline layer of the open ocean, and in marginal seas like the Mediterranean, Caribbean, South China Sea, and Red Sea. Planktic foraminifers are absent in shallow marginal seas, for example, the North Sea. Planktic fo- raminifers respond to food, temperature and chemistry of the ambient seawater. Species abundance varies according to seasons, water masses, and water depths. Symbiont-bearing species depend on light and are restricted to the eu- photic zone. Planktic foraminifers constitute a minor portion of total zooplankton, but are major producers of marine calcareous particles (shells) deposited on the ocean floor where they form the so-called foraminiferal ooze. Planktic foraminifers contribute substantially to the fossil record of marine sediments and are of high ecologic, paleoceanographic, and stratigraphic significance since the mid-Cretaceous. Radiocarbon (14C) gives an absolute age of shell formation within late Pleistocene and Holocene sediments. Factors that determine the modern faunal compo- sition are applied to interpretation of the fossil assemblages, for example, by multiple regression techniques (transfer functions) to yield an estimate on ancient environmental parameters. The chemical composition of the calcareous shell (stable isotopes and trace elements) holds clues to the chemical and physical state of the ambient seawater and is useful in the reconstruction of temperature, chemical state, and biological productivity of the ancient marine environment.},

abstract = {The extrapallial fluid (EPF), the fluid component of the shell-forming system of molluscs, has been examined for its effect on the rate of CaCO3 crystal formation in vitro. The medium was an artificial inorganic extrapallial fluid supersaturated with respect to CaCO3. EPF of the bivalves Crassostrea virginica and Mercenaria mercenaria strongly inhibited CaCO3 crystallization in high dilution. The inhibitory material had negatively charged groups as indicated by the removal of inhibition subsequent to passage through a DEAE-Sephadex column and the restoration of inhibition in material eluted from the column with 2.0 M NaCl. Polyaspartic and polyglutamic acids with COO- groups also inhibited crystal formation whereas polyamino acids lacking those groups and free amino acids were without effect. The inhibition by the acidic polyamino acids suggests that polypeptides known to be present in EPF are one possible cause of inhibition of crystal formation by EPF. Mg present in EPF was also strongly inhibitory. The observed inhibition of in vitro crystallization by EPF and Mg indicates that these substances could be factors in governing CaCO3 deposition rate in molluscan shell.},

abstract = {Biofilms are complex communities of microorganisms attached to surfaces or associated with interfaces. Despite the focus of modern microbiology research on pure culture, planktonic (free-swimming) bacteria, it is now widely recognized that most bacteria found in natural, clinical, and industrial settings persist in association with surfaces. Furthermore, these microbial communities are often composed of multiple species that interact with each other and their environment. The determination of biofilm architecture, particularly the spatial arrangement of microcolonies (clusters of cells) relative to one another, has profound implications for the function of these complex communities. Numerous new experimental approaches and methodologies have been developed in order to explore metabolic interactions, phylogenetic groupings, and competition among members of the biofilm. To complement this broad view of biofilm ecology, individual organisms have been studied using molecular genetics in order to identify the genes required for biofilm development and to dissect the regulatory pathways that control the plankton-to-biofilm transition. These molecular genetic studies have led to the emergence of the concept of biofilm formation as a novel system for the study of bacterial development. The recent explosion in the field of biofilm research has led to exciting progress in the development of new technologies for studying these communities, advanced our understanding of the ecological significance of surface-attached bacteria, and provided new insights into the molecular genetic basis of biofilm development.},

abstract = {The calcium isotope ratios (??44Ca = [(44Ca/ 40Ca)sample/(44Ca/40Ca)standard-1] ?? 1000) of Orbulina universa and of inorganically precipitated aragonite are positively correlated to temperature. The slopes of 0.019 and 0.015??? ??C-1, respectively, are a factor of 13 and 16 times smaller than the previously determined fractionation from a second foraminifera, Globigerinoides sacculifer, having a slope of about 0.24??? ??C-1. The observation that ??44Ca is positively correlated to temperature is opposite in sign to the oxygen isotopic fractionation (?? 18O) in calcium carbonate (CaCO3). These observations are explained by a model which considers that Ca2+ -ions forming ionic bonds are affected by kinetic fractionation only, whereas covalently bound atoms like oxygen are affected by kinetic and equilibrium fractionation. From thermodynamic consideration of kinetic isotope fractionation, it can be shown that the slope of the enrichment factor ??(T) is mass-dependent. However, for O. universa and the inorganic precipitates, the calculated mass of about 520 ??? 60 and 640 ??? 70 amu (atomic mass units) is not compatible with the expected ion mass for 40Ca and 44Ca. To reconcile this discrepancy, we propose that Ca diffusion and ??44Ca isotope fractionation at liquid/solid transitions involves Ca2+ -aquocomplexes (Ca[H2O]n2+ ?? mH2O) rather than pure Ca2+-ion diffusion. From our measurements we calculate that such a hypothesized Ca2+ -aquocomplex correlates to a hydration number of up to 25 water molecules (490 amu). For O. universa we propose that their biologically mediated Ca isotope fractionation resembles fractionation during inorganic precipitation of CaCO3 in seawater. To explain the different Ca isotope fractionation in O. universa and in G. sacculifer, we suggest that the latter species actively dehydrates the Ca2+-aquocomplex before calcification takes place. The very different temperature response of Ca isotopes in the two species suggests that the use of ??44Ca as a temperature proxy will require careful study of species effects. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {We analyzed published rates of extracellular release (ER) of organic carbon to determine the primary constraints on this process and its importance to bacteria. From 16 studies we extracted observations of ER, particulate primary production (PP), and phytoplankton biomass. In a regression model based on 225 observations, PP explained 69{\%} of the variance in ER. From this model we estimate the average percent extracellular release (PER) to be 13{\%} of total fixation. The slope of this relationship does not support the hypothesis that the PER declines with increasing productivity. Differences exist between marine and freshwater systems. In lakes, ER increases nonlinearly with productivity, resulting in very low PER in very eutrophic systems. In coastal marine and estuarine systems, ER increases linearly with productivity and the PER does not vary systematically. ER is not primarily related to phytoplankton biomass as predicted by passive diffusion models. Instead, ER appears to be constrained by the total availability of photosynthates. By comparing our model to an existing model of bacterial production and assuming a 50{\%} growth efficiency, we estimate that ER amounts to less than half the C required for bacterial growth in most pelagic systems.},

abstract = {A scanning transmission X-ray microscope illuminated with synchrotron light was used to investigate the speciation and spatial distributions of metals in a microbial biofilm cultivated from river water. Metal 2p absorption edge signals were used to provide metal speciation (through shapes of the absorption spectra) and quantitative spatial distributions of the metal species. This paper presents sample data and describes methods for extracting quantitative maps of metal species from image sequences recorded in the region of the metal 2p edges. Comparisons were made with biochemical characterization of the same region using images recorded at the C 1s and O 1s edges. The method is applied to detailed quantitative analysis of ferrous and ferric iron in a river biofilm, in concert with mapping Ni(II) and Mn(II) species in the same region. The distributions of the metal species are discussed in the context of the biofilm structure. These results demonstrate that soft X-ray STXM measurements at the metal 2p absorption edges can be used to speciate metals and to provide quantitative spatial distribution maps for metal species in environmental samples with 50 nm spatial resolution.},

abstract = {RECORDS Of past changes in the pH of the oceans should provide insights into how the carbonate chemistry of the oceans has changed over time. The latter is related to changes in the atmospheric CO2 content, such as that which occurred during the last glacial-interglacial transition(1). Previous studies(2,3) have shown that the fractionation of boron isotopes between sea water and precipitated carbonate minerals is pH-dependent. This finding has been used to reconstruct the evolution of ocean pH over the past 20 million years by analyses of boron isotopes in the carbonate shells of foraminifera(4). Here we use the same approach to estimate changes in ocean pH between the last glacial and the Holocene period. We estimate that the deep Atlantic and Pacific oceans had a pH 0.3 +/- 0.1 units higher during the last glaciation. The accompanying change in carbonate ion concentration is sufficient to account for the decrease in atmospheric p(co2) during the glacial period(1). These results are consistent with the hypothesis(5) that the low CO2 content of the glacial atmosphere was caused by an increased ratio of organic carbon to carbonate in the 'rain' to the sea floor, which led to an increase in carbonate ion concentration (and thus in pH) of deep water without a corresponding increase in the lysocline depth.},

abstract = {It is widely known that macromolecules, such as proteins, can control the nucleation and growth of inorganic solids in biomineralizing organisms. However, what is not known are the complementary molecular interactions, organization, and rearrangements that occur when proteins interact with inorganic solids during the formation of biominerals. The organic-mineral interface (OMI) is expected to be the site for these phenomena, and is therefore extraordinarily interesting to investigate. In this report, we employ X-ray absorption near edge (XANES) spectromicroscopy to investigate the electronic structure of both calcium carbonate mineral crystals and polypeptides, and detect changing bonds at the OMI during crystal growth in the presence of polypeptides. We acquired XANES spectra from calcium carbonate crystals grown in the presence of three mollusk nacre-associated polypeptides (AP7N, AP24N, n16N) and in the presence of a sea urchin spicule matrix protein, LSM34. All these model biominerals gave similar results, including the disruption of CO bonds in calcite and enhancement of the peaks associated with C-H bonds and C-O bonds in peptides, indicating ordering of the amino acid side chains in the mineral-associated polypeptides and carboxylate binding. This is the first evidence of the mutual effect of calcite on peptide chain and peptide chain on calcite during biomineralization. We also show that these changes do not occur when Asp and Glu are replaced in the n16N sequence with Asn and Gln, respectively, demonstrating that carboxyl groups in Asp and Glu do participate in polypeptide-mineral molecular associations.},

This effect, also found to be occurring in inland fisheries, is most pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere.

abstract = {Increasing atmospheric pCO2 reduces the saturation state of seawater with respect to the aragonite, high-Mg calcite (Mg/Ca{\textgreater}0.04), and low-Mg calcite (Mg/Ca{\textless}0.04) minerals from which marine calcifiers build their shells and skeletons. Notably, these polymorphs of CaCO3 have different solubilities in seawater: aragonite is more soluble than pure calcite, and the solubility of calcite increases with its Mg-content. Although much recent progress has been made investigating the effects of CO2-induced ocean acidification on rates of biological calcification, considerable uncertainties remain regarding impacts on shell/skeletal polymorph mineralogy. To investigate this subject, eighteen species of marine calcifiers were reared for 60-days in seawater bubbled with air-CO2 mixtures of 409±6, 606±7, 903±12, and 2856±54ppm pCO2, yielding aragonite saturation states (?A) of 2.5±0.4, 2.0±0.4, 1.5±0.3, and 0.7±0.2. Calcite/aragonite ratios within bimineralic calcifiers increased with increasing pCO2, but were invariant within monomineralic calcifiers. Calcite Mg/Ca ratios (Mg/CaC) also varied with atmospheric pCO2 for two of the five high-Mg-calcite-producing organisms, but not for the low-Mg-calcite-producing organisms. These results suggest that shell/skeletal mineralogy within some-but not all-marine calcifiers will change as atmospheric pCO2 continues rising as a result of fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. Paleoceanographic reconstructions of seawater Mg/Ca, temperature, and salinity from the Mg/CaC of well-preserved calcitic marine fossils may also be improved by accounting for the effects of paleo-atmospheric pCO2 on skeletal Mg-fractionation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soft X-ray microscopy employs the photoelectric absorption contrast between water and protein in the 2.34-4.38nm wavelength region to visualize protein structures down to 30nm size without any staining methods. Due to the large depth of focus of the Fresnel zone plates used as X-ray objectives, computed tomography based on the X-ray microscopic images can be used to reconstruct the local linear absorption coefficient inside the three-dimensional specimen volume. High-resolution X-ray images require a high specimen radiation dose, and a series of images taken at different viewing angles is needed for computed tomography. Therefore, cryo microscopy is necessary to preserve the structural integrity of hydrated biological specimens during image acquisition. The cryo transmission X-ray microscope at the electron storage ring BESSY I (Berlin) was used to obtain a tilt series of images of the frozen-hydrated green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The living specimens were inserted into borosilicate glass capillaries and, in this first experiment, rapidly cooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen. The capillary specimen holders allow image acquisition over the full angular range of 180??. The reconstruction shows for the first time details down to 60nm size inside a frozen-hydrated biological specimen and conveys a clear impression of the internal structures. This technique is expected to be applicable to a wide range of biological specimens, such as the cell nucleus. It offers the possibility of imaging the three-dimensional structure of hydrated biological specimens close to their natural living state. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

First and last occurrence events appear in the two remaining latitudinal regions during the Eocene and increase in a stepwise fashion, mimicking significant cooling events.

However, because of their variable compositions, the apatites from different deposits showed different i.e.p. values ranging from pH 3.5 to 6.7, while the i.e.p. of calcite occurred at pH 8.2. Study of the effect of lattice-forming ions on the zeta potential indicates that calcium ions produce specific ionic adsorption effects on apatites, whereas they are potential-determining ions for calcite. On the other hand, as expected, phosphate and carbonate ions function as potential-determining ions for apatite and calcite, respectively. The experimental data suggest that the zeta potential of apatite is a function of mineral-water contact time. The degree of variation in zeta-potential values appears to be influenced by the electrolytic environment of the apatite suspension. ?? 1978.},

abstract = {V-ATPases constitute a ubiquitous family of heteromultimeric, proton translocating proteins. According to their localization in a multitude of eukaryotic endomembranes and plasma membranes, they energize many different transport processes. Currently, a handful of specific inhibitors of the V-ATPase are known, which represent valuable tools for the characterization of transport processes on the level of tissues, single cells or even purified proteins. The understanding of how these inhibitors function may provide a basis to develop new drugs for the benefit of patients suffering from diseases such as osteoporosis or cancer. For this purpose, it appears absolutely essential to determine the exact inhibitor binding site in a target protein on the one side and to uncover the crucial structural elements of an inhibitor on the other side. However, even for some of the most popular and long known V-ATPase inhibitors, such as bafilomycin or concanamycin, the authentic structures of their binding sites are elusive. The aim of this review is to summarize the recent advances for the old players in the inhibition game, the plecomacrolides bafilomycin and concanamycin, and to introduce some of the new players, the macrolacton archazolid, the benzolactone enamides salicylihalamide, lobatamide, apicularen, oximidine and cruentaren, and the indolyls.},

abstract = {Synchrotron-based, Earth sciences research carried out over the last 5 years is reviewed with special attention being given to X-ray absorption studies; X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence microprobe applications are considered more briefly. A comprehensive bibliography is included. The main part of the paper summarizes recent work carried out at the Daresbury SRS. K-edge XAS studies of glasses as models for silicate melts provide information on the local structural environments of Si, Fe2+ and Fe3+. By analogy with synthetic "leucites" which contain Fe2+ and Fe3+ in tetrahedral framework sites, it seems that many model glasses also contain both oxidation states of Fe in the network, rather than as network modifiers. The structural sites occupied by the minor elements Mn, Zn and Ti in staurolite have been identified using XAFS; Mn and Zn substitute for Fe2+ in the tetrahedral T2 site, while Ti occupies the distorted M2 octahedral site. L-edge spectroscopy is used to identify the valencies and electronic structures of Mn and Fe in minerals and the Fe2+:Fe3+ ratio in a natural spinel is determined. The polarized nature of the synchrotron beam is exploited in determining the Fe X-ray absorption anisotropy in single crystal tourmaline and epidote. XRD powder studies include Rietveld-refinement structure determination and compressibility studies. Synthetic "leucites" having the stoichiometry K2MgSi5O12 have distinctly different structures. The dry-synthesized form is cubic Ia3d with Si and Mg fully disordered on tetrahedral framework sites, while the hydrothermally-synthesized polymorph is monoclinic P21/c with Si and Mg fully disordered on, respectively, 10 and 2 tetrahedral sites. The reversible tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition in gillespite (BaFeSi4O10) has been studied in a diamond anvil cell using ED detection and found to occur at 1.2 ?? 0.1 GPa. The anomalous compressibility observed has been interpreted in terms of ferroelastic and coelastic phenomena and the related order parameters analysed using Landau theory. The compressibility of MgCO3, determined up to 20 GPa, has been combined with thermochemical data to obtain an "equation to state" for magnesite and it is found that magnesite is likely to be the main host for carbon in the Earth's lower mantle. ?? 1995.},

As the present production of deep water in this area is driven by an excess of evaporation over precipitation and continental runoff, atmospheric water transport may be an important element in climate change. Changes in the production rate of deep water in this sector of the ocean may push the climate system from one quasi-stable mode of operation to another.},

Some biochemical and genetic evidence for regulation of S uptake and assimilation is available for the freshwater model alga Chlamydomonas. However, the marine environment is substantially different from most fresh waters, containing up to 50 times higher free sulfate concentrations and challenging the adaptive mechanisms of primary and secondary S metabolism in marine algae.

In certain species, notably Emiliania huxleyi, the heterococcolithbearing phase alternates with a non-calcifying stage, whereas in others the heterococcolith-bearing phase alternates with a holococcolith-bearing phase. Heterococcolithophore-holococcolithophore life cycles have previously been observed for only one species in culture, but have also been inferred from an increasing number of observations of combination coccospheres. 18S rDNA sequences from pure cultures of both the heterococcolith-bearing and holococcolith-bearing phases of Coccolithus pelagicus were identical, providing an additional indication of their identity as different life cycle stages of the same species. Flow cytometric analyses have been undertaken on SybrGreen-stained nuclei isolated from pure cultures of the two phases of four coccolithophore species (Coccolithus pelagicus, Calcidiscus leptoporus, Coronosphaera mediterranea and Emiliania huxleyi) in order to determine relative DNA content. Results confirm the hypothesis that holococcolithophoreheterococcolithophore life cycles are haplo-diploid in nature. Light microscope observations of the processes of sexual fusion and meiosis are reported for two of the experimental species. The results are discussed in the context of the evolution of biomineralization in the coccolithophores and the possible ubiquity of haplo-diploidy in the haptophytes.},

abstract = {The classical terrace-ledge-kink model of crystal growth is widely used to interpret mineral formation in biological and geological systems. A key assumption underlying application of the model is that thermal fluctuations of steps are sufficiently rapid to produce an abundance of kink sites for attachment of growth units. High-resolution in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of step-edge structure and dynamics show this physical picture to be invalid for the common mineral calcite whose steps exhibit low kink density and weak step edge fluctuations. As a consequence, interactions of impurities with calcite step edges cannot be interpreted with traditional thermodynamic models based on minimization of the Gibbs free energy. Instead, impurity-step interactions follow a different mechanism determined by the kinetics of attachment and detachment. Step advance is unimpeded when the creation of new kinks by attachment of growth units to the step outpaces binding of impurities to the newly created kinks. This kink-limited model offers a plausible explanation for reports of "kinetic disequilibrium" of trace element signatures. Moreover, because kink density is tied to crystal solubility, these findings argue for a theory based on weak fluctuations to interpret growth of many common crystalline phases of importance in geochemical, biological, and technological settings.},

abstract = {The threat posed to coral reefs by changes in seawater pH and carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification) raises the need for a better mechanistic understanding of physiological processes linked to coral calcification. Current models of coral calcification argue that corals elevate extracellular pH under their calcifying tissue relative to seawater to promote skeleton formation, but pH measurements taken from the calcifying tissue of living, intact corals have not been achieved to date. We performed live tissue imaging of the reef coral Stylophora pistillata to determine extracellular pH under the calcifying tissue and intracellular pH in calicoblastic cells. We worked with actively calcifying corals under flowing seawater and show that extracellular pH (pHe) under the calicoblastic epithelium is elevated by approximately 0.5 and approximately 0.2 pH units relative to the surrounding seawater in light and dark conditions respectively. By contrast, the intracellular pH (pHi) of the calicoblastic epithelium remains stable in the light and dark. Estimates of aragonite saturation states derived from our data indicate the elevation in subcalicoblastic pHe favour calcification and may thus be a critical step in the calcification process. However, the observed close association of the calicoblastic epithelium with the underlying crystals suggests that the calicoblastic cells influence the growth of the coral skeleton by other processes in addition to pHe modification. The procedure used in the current study provides a novel, tangible approach for future investigations into these processes and the impact of environmental change on the cellular mechanisms underpinning coral calcification.},

abstract = {We present ocean chemistry calculations based on ocean general circulation model simulations of atmospheric CO2 emission, stabilization of atmospheric CO2 content, and stabilization of atmospheric CO2 achieved in total or in part by injection of CO2 to the deep ocean interior. Our goal is to provide first-order results from various CO2 pathways, allowing correspondence with studies of marine biological effects of added CO2. Parts of the Southern Ocean become undersaturated with respect to aragonite under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1, A2, B1, and B2 emission pathways and the WRE pathways that stabilize CO2 at 650 ppm or above. Cumulative atmospheric emission of 5000 Pg C produces aragonite undersaturation in most of the surface ocean; 10,000 Pg C also produces calcite undersaturation in most of the surface ocean. Stabilization of atmospheric CO2 at 450 ppm produces both calcite and aragonite undersaturation in most of the deep ocean. The simulated SRES pathways produce global surface pH reductions of ∼0.3–0.5 units by year 2100. Approximately this same reduction is produced by WRE650 and WRE1000 stabilization scenarios and by the 1250 Pg C emission scenario by year 2300. Atmospheric emissions of 5000 Pg C and 20,000 Pg C produce global surface pH reductions of 0.8 and 1.4 units, respectively, by year 2300. Simulations of deep ocean CO2 injection as an alternative to atmospheric release show greater chemical impact on the deep ocean as the price for having less impact on the surface ocean and climate. Changes in ocean chemistry of the magnitude shown are likely to be biologically significant.},

abstract = {The large temporal and spatial variability in carbon isotope fractionation of marine phytoplankton (?p) is thought to reflect differences in environmental conditions. Meaningful interpretation of this variability requires an understanding of the processes responsible for phytoplankton isotope fractionation. While numerous factors have been suggested to potentially influence ?p. recent theoretical and experimental evidence has emphasized the primary role of phytoplankton growth rate (?) and CO2 concentration ([CO2aq]) in controlling ?(p). Experimental examination of the relationship of ?p with p and [CO2aq] in studies using different experimental approaches, however, has yielded inconsistent results. Here we directly compare new and previously published data on ?(p) as a function of CO2 concentration and growth rate for the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. When grown under nitrogen-deficient conditions (nitrate-limited chemostat), ?(p) of R tricornutum decreases with increasing growth rate. In contrast, under N-replete conditions ?(p) values are considerably lower at comparable growth rates and CO2 concentrations and are largely insensitive to a 3-fold increase in growth rate due to increasing photon flux density. In both experimental approaches, ?(p) shows a relatively small CO2 sensitivity in the range of CO2 concentrations naturally occurring in the ocean (8 to 25 ?mol kg-1). Below ca 5 ?mol CO2 kg-1, a strong decline in ?(p) with decreasing [CO2aq] is observed. The apparent difference in ?(p) responses between nitrate-limited and light-controlled cultures of P. tricornutum suggests a principal difference in carbon acquisition for different growth-rate-limiting resources. A mechanistic explanation is proposed and potential implications for the interpretation of phytoplankton carbon isotope fractionation are discussed.},

In addition, as compared with the conventional TAP, due to the very short duration of laser pulses, no spread in the energy of emitted ions is observed, leading to a very high mass resolution in a straight TAP in a wide angle configuration. At last, laser pulses can be used to bring the intense electric field required for the field evaporation on poor conductive materials such as intrinsic Si at low temperature.

abstract = {Estuaries may be important reservoirs for contaminants as they tend to act as sinks for fine, contaminant-reactive sediments, and, historically, they have acted as centres for industrial and urban development. Analysis of dated sediment cores from these areas may allow historical trends in heavy metal input to be reconstructed, and recent and historical inputs of metal contaminants to be compared. Undisturbed saltmarsh settings have been used widely in the reconstruction of historical trends in metal input as saltmarshes provide a stable, vegetated substrate of dominantly fine sediments, and are less prone to erosion and reworking than adjacent mudflat areas. In comparison, much less research on historical pollution trends has been undertaken at estuarine sites which are prone to severe local disturbance, such as intertidal areas which are routinely dredged or where sedimentary processes have been modified by human activities such as shipping, salt working, port activities, land claim etc. This paper assesses the usefulness of 210Pb and 137Cs dating, combined with geochemical studies, in reconstructing historical trends in heavy metal input and sediment accretion in 3 heavily-modified, industrialised estuarine areas in Europe: the Bilbao estuary (Spain), Southampton Water (UK), and the Mulinello estuary (Sicily). Of these sites, only a salt marsh core from the Mulinello estuary provides a high-resolution record of recent heavy metal inputs. In Southampton Water only a partial record of changing metal inputs over time is retained due to land-claim and possible early-diagenetic remobilisation, while at Bilbao the vertical distribution of heavy metals in intertidal flats is mainly controlled by input on reworked sediment particles and variations in sediment composition. Where 137Cs and 210Pb distributions with depth allow a chronology of sediment deposition to be established, and early-diagenetic remobilisation has been minimal, mudflat and saltmarsh cores from even the most heavily-disturbed estuarine sites can provide useful information on variations in historical contaminant input. When the sediments have been vigorously mixed or reworked, large-scale compositional variations are present, or significant early-diagenetic remobilisation has occurred, however, only general information on the scale of contamination can be obtained. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {THE carbon isotope ratio (d13C) and cadmium content (Cd/Ca) of benthic foraminifera shells have been used to reconstruct deep-water circulation patterns of the glacial oceans1–7. These tracers co-vary with phosphorus in the modern ocean because they are nearly quantitatively regenerated from sinking biological debris in the upper water column. Hence they can be used to reconstruct the distribution of labile nutrients in glacial water masses. Independent constraints on glacial deep-ocean circulation patterns could be provided by a tracer of the distribution of silica and alkalinity, the deeply regenerated constituents of planktonic hard parts. Barium shares key aspects of its behaviour with these refractory nutrients because it is removed from solution in surface waters and incorporated into sinking particles which slowly dissolve deep in the water column and in the sediments8. The fractionation of Ba between deep-water masses of the major ocean basins is largely controlled by thermohaline circulation patterns, so Ba conforms to different boundary conditions from Cd anddelta 13C. As Ba substitutes into trigonal carbonates9, it is a potential palaeoceano-graphic tracer if the Ba content of foraminifera shells reflects ambient dissolved Ba concentrations. Here we present data from Recent core-top benthic foraminifera which indicate that the Ba content of some recent calcitic benthic foraminifera does co-vary with bottom-water Ba.},

abstract = {Ectoparasites are ubiquitous, often highly damaging and in most cases cannot be permanently eradicated; hence, they must usually be managed at a local scale with insecticides or endectocides. However, the growth in resistance, the slow rate of development of new actives, coupled with environmental and health concerns associated with the continued use of some of the existing neurotoxic insecticides, suggest that more sophisticated approaches to their management need to be identified. These approaches need to allow ectoparasite populations to be maintained at acceptable levels, while conserving the compounds that remain available. The development of integrated approaches, in which cascades of management tactics are deployed, with parasiticides available as one component to be used in requisite circumstances, may be the most appropriate route to achieving this aim. An essential element of such an approach is the clear articulation of the purpose of intervention and rational justification of the time-point and manner in which it is attempted. However, for this to be possible, considerably better information is required about the effects of ectoparasite abundance on animal welfare and productivity, in addition to the greater availability of effective alternative control tools. To this end, recent work undertaken at the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Bristol, into the use of biological control agents, off-host trapping and the selective treatment of more highly susceptible individuals or classes of host, is reviewed here. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Background: In lakes that have become eutrophic due to sewage discharges or nutrient runoff from land, problems such as algal blooms and oxygen deficiency often persist even when nutrient supplies have been reduced. One reason is that phosphorus stored in the sediments can exchange with the water. There are indications that the high abundance of phytoplankton, turbid water and lack of submerged vegetation seen in many eutrophic lakes may represent a semi-stable state. For that reason, a shift back to more natural clear-water conditions could be difficult to achieve. In some cases, though, temporary mitigation of eutrophication-related problems has been accomplished through biomanipulation: stocks of zooplanktivorous fish have been reduced by intensive fishing, leading to increased populations of phytoplankton-feeding zooplankton. Moreover, reduction of benthivorous fish may result in lower phosphorus fluxes from the sediments. An alternative to reducing the dominance of planktivores and benthivores by fishing is to stock lakes with piscivorous fish. These two approaches have often been used in combination. The implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive has recently led to more stringent demands for measures against eutrophication, and a systematic review could clarify whether biomanipulation is efficient as a measure of that kind. Methods: The review will examine primary field studies of how large-scale biomanipulation has affected water quality and community structure in eutrophic lakes or reservoirs in temperate regions. Such studies can be based on comparison between conditions before and after manipulation, on comparison between treated and non-treated water bodies, or both. Relevant outcomes include Secchi depth, concentrations of oxygen, nutrients, suspended solids and chlorophyll, abundance and composition of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish, and coverage of submerged macrophytes.},

abstract = {Aquaporins are a family of membrane proteins specialized in rapid water conduction across biological membranes. Whether these channels also conduct gas molecules and the physiological significance of this potential function have not been well understood. Here we report 140 ns of molecular dynamics simulations of membrane-embedded AQP1 and of a pure POPE bilayer addressing these questions. The permeability of AQP1 to two types of gas molecules, O2 and CO2, was investigated using two complementary methods, namely, explicit gas diffusion simulation and implicit ligand sampling. The simulations show that the central (tetrameric) pore of AQP1 can be readily used by either gas molecule to permeate the channel. The two approaches produced similar free energy profiles associated with gas permeation through the central pore: a -0.4 to -1.7 kcal/mol energy well in the middle, and a 3.6-4.6 kcal/mol energy barrier in the periplasmic vestibule. The barrier appears to be mainly due to a dense cluster of water molecules anchored in the periplasmic mouth of the central pore by four aspartate residues. Water pores show a very low permeability to O2, but may contribute to the overall permeation of CO2 due to its more hydrophilic nature. Although the central pore of AQP1 is found to be gas permeable, the pure POPE bilayer provides a much larger cross-sectional area, thus exhibiting a much lower free energy barrier for CO2 and O2 permeation. As such, gas conduction through AQP1 may only be physiologically relevant either in membranes of low gas permeability, or in cells where a major fraction of the cellular membrane is occupied by AQPs. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The hard skeleton of sea urchin spines consists of a monolithic single crystalline magnesian calcite with typical contents of MgCO3 ranging from 2 to 12 mol{\%} and about 0.1 weight{\%} of occluded organic macromolecules. These macromolecules take effect on the calcite crystal growth, forming the spine shape in a porous spongy structure crossed by filled wedges of calcite radially arranged about the long axis of the spine. The single crystal structure analysis and polarization microscopy confirm the perfect alignment of the crystallites, thus the spine is a single crystal of calcite with the spine axis along the crystallographic c-axis, in agreement with earlier experiments. The magnesium content of the skeletal parts of the sea urchin is approximately linearly related with the water temperature of the sea urchin habitat. Elemental and chemical analysis showed an inhomogeneous Mg distribution in single spines: The Mg content increases from the spine-tip to the base by about 2 mol{\%} at average. This structural inhomogeneity leads to a solid solution hardening of the material by the statistical incorporation of Mg2+ ions in a crystal structure. The size difference between Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions impedes the propagation of cracks, thus affecting the fracture behavior of the biogenic calcite, which is conchoidal in contrast to the perfect {\{}10.4{\}} cleavage of geological calcite. The accumulation of Mg in the spine-base most likely serves to enhance this effect and thus strengthens the spine close to the shell.},

abstract = {Despite similar physical properties, the Northern and Southern Atlantic subtropical gyres have different biogeochemical regimes. The Northern subtropical gyre, which is subject to iron deposition from Saharan dust(1), is depleted in the nutrient phosphate, possibly as a result of iron-enhanced nitrogen fixation(2). Although phosphate depleted, rates of carbon fixation in the euphotic zone of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre are comparable to those of the South Atlantic subtropical gyre(3), which is not phosphate limited. Here we use the activity of the phosphorus-specific enzyme alkaline phosphatase to show potentially enhanced utilization of dissolved organic phosphorus occurring over much of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. We find that during the boreal spring up to 30{\%} of primary production in the North Atlantic gyre is supported by dissolved organic phosphorus. Our diagnostics and composite map of the surface distribution of dissolved organic phosphorus in the subtropical Atlantic Ocean reveal shorter residence times in the North Atlantic gyre than the South Atlantic gyre. We interpret the asymmetry of dissolved organic phosphorus cycling in the two gyres as a consequence of enhanced nitrogen fixation in the North Atlantic Ocean(4), which forces the system towards phosphorus limitation. We suggest that dissolved organic phosphorus utilization may contribute to primary production in other phosphorus-limited ocean settings as well.},

abstract = {Spontaneous formation of locally ordered patterns during dewetting of thin films on homogeneous and heterogeneous substrates is investigated based on the 3-D nonlinear equation of motion. Physicochemical heterogeneities engender the rapid formation of the primary holes that serve as "seeds" for the formation of locally ordered structures. The secondary multiring structure surrounding the primary hole evolves by one of the following two different pathways depending on the film thickness vis-{\`{a}}-vis the location of the minimum in the spinodal curve: (A) Thick films evolve by the formation of secondary satellite holes that originate from a ring-like depression behind the rim of the primary hole. The process of ordering is repeated until the true spinodal holes appear on the remaining substrate. (B) Ordering in a relatively thin film occurs by the formation of droplets caused by the disintegration of the elevated rim that surrounds the primary hole. The radial distance between the successive ordered layers is close to the spinodal length scale, lambda(m). Droplets within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly greater than lambda(m), whereas holes within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly less than lambda(m). The number density of holes or droplets in the ordered pattern is of the same order as the predictions of the spinodal theory. The number of ordered layers and the size of the locally ordered domain depend significantly on the relative magnitudes of the time scales for the following events: (1) formation of the primary hole, (2) growth of holes (inverse of hole-growth velocity), (3) formation of a secondary feature (hole or droplet) adjacent to the primary hole, (4) true spinodal rupture far from the primary hole. The morphology of an ordered structure can therefore be tailored by modulation of the film thickness and the short- and long-range intermolecular interactions (substrate surface properties), since these affect the time scales 1 to 4 in different ways.},

abstract = {The ostracod is a marine or freshwater crustacean with a bivalved carapace that encloses the rest of the body. The valves composing the carapace are heavily calci fled and, being an integral part of the exoskeleton, they are shed during each molt. The valves of the new exoskeleton are then calcified while the rest of the exo skeleton remains unmineralized. The calcification process associated with molting in ostracods is not well known. X-ray diffraction studies by Kesling (1951) on Cypridopsis vidua determined that the calcium is deposited within the ostracod valve as calcite. Fassbinder (1912), experimenting with the same species, concluded that the immediate source of the calcium used in calcification was from the body of the ostracod rather than from the aqueous environment. This was determined by growing the ostracods in cal cium-free water and feeding them calcium-free food, and finding that they could still calcify the new valves after a molt. Van Morkhoven (1962) reported that the animal's diet will affect the calcification of the valves, with rich calcium diets pro ducing secondary thickening and numerous protuberances. Finally, Kesling (195 1) proposed that C. vidua has no special cells which secrete the shell material ; it is formed rather by all the epidermal cells within the duplicature. He believed the ostracod calcification process was different from that of other crustaceans that have been studied. The objective of this study was to gain some information about this calcifica tion process. Experiments using Ca45 as a tracer were conducted to determine whether any calcium is reabsorbed from the valves prior to molting and whether calcium is stored for use in later valve calcification. Autoradiographs were pre pared to determine which cells were active in calcifying the new valves.

Small-scale removal of sediment layers in isolated broads demonstrated the feasibility, both technical and economic, of this technique, but experience then showed that sediment removal alone could not provide long-term restoration.

abstract = {The best way to collect free-floating planktonic foraminifera for laboratory study and experimentation is to capture them in glass jars held by scuba divers at 3 to 5 m depth in open-ocean conditions. This blue water diving method is preferred over collection with a plankton net because it minimizes trauma and enhances the survival of taxa that are easily damaged or killed when thy come into contact with the mesh of a plankton net. Planktonic foraminifera can be discriminated from other groups of marine plankton (e.g., radiolaria, acantharia) by focusing from 50 to 80 crn distance, whereas species-level identification is best accomplished at a range of 20 to 50 cm. One fine-mesh collection bag containing wide-mouthed collection jars (-230 ml) that are each filled with seawater is hung onto a 25 m length vertical down-line that is passed through a float and tethered to the dive boat. An empty collection bag is also attached to the line to receive jars with captured specimens. Divers are tethered to the down-line through a safety-diver monitored trapeze to ensure continuous contact with the diving platform. Foraminifera are collected by gently rotating the jar around a specimen as the lid is slowly lowered onto the jar top. After the lid is firmly replaced the jar is put into the receiving sack. Using this method, as many as GO to 80 specimens/hr can be collected depending on planktonic foraminifera abundance. Upon return to the laboratory the collected specimens are transferred to culture vessels using a wide-mouthed pipette. At this point, the researcher is ready to initiate a desired experiment.},

abstract = {Antarctic continental-scale glaciation is generally assumed to have initiated at the Eocene-Oligocene Transition, yet its subsequent evolution is poorly constrained. We reconstruct changes in bottom water temperature and global ice volume from 0 to 17 Ma using $\delta$18O in conjunction with Mg/Ca records of the infaunal benthic foraminifer, O. umbonatus from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 806 (equatorial Pacific; {\~{}}2500 m). Considering uncertainties in core top calibrations and sensitivity to seawater Mg/Ca (Mg/Ca)sw, we produce a range of Mg/Ca-temperature-Mg/Casw calibrations. Our favored exponential temperature calibration is Mg/Ca = 0.66 ± 0.08 × Mg/Casw0.27±0.06 × e(0.114±0.02 × BWT) and our favored linear temperature calibration is Mg/Ca = (1.21 ± 0.04 + 0.12 ± 0.004 × BWT (bottom water temperature)) × (Mg/Casw−0.003±0.02) (stated errors are 2 s.e.). The equations are obtained by comparing O. umbonatus Mg/Ca for a Paleocene-Eocene section from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 690 (Weddell Sea) to $\delta$18O temperatures, calculated assuming ice-free conditions during this peak warmth period of the Cenozoic. This procedure suggests negligible effect of Mg/Casw on the Mg distribution coefficient (DMg). Application of the new equations to the Site 806 record leads to the suggestion that global ice volume was greater than today after the Middle Miocene Climate Transition ({\~{}}14 Ma). ODP Site 806 bottom waters cooled and freshened as the Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient increased, and climate cooled through the Pliocene, prior to the Plio-Pleistocene glaciation of the Northern Hemisphere. The records indicate a decoupling of deep water temperatures and global ice volume, demonstrating the importance of thresholds in the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet.},

Both the evolutionary recovery and the biogeochemical recovery occurred in two stages. The second stage of evolutionary radiation peaked nearly four million years after the extinction, immediately after the abrupt final recovery of the organic flux to deep waters. The timing of these events suggests that the final postextinction recovery of planktic foraminiferal diversity was directly contingent on the final recovery of the marine carbon cycle. This second radiation was defined by the diversification of tropical photosymbiotic forms that dominated low- and mid-latitude assemblages long into the Eocene. We hypothesize that this diversification was a result of the reappearance of oligotrophic oceans as the organic flux from the surface ocean to deep water fully recovered from the mass extinction.},

Coral apexes had the highest pH cf and experienced the smallest changes in pH cf in response to acidification. Lateral growth was associated with lower pH cf and greater changes with acidification. Calcification showed a pattern similar to pH cf, with lateral growth being more strongly affected by acidification than apical. Regulation of pH cf is therefore spatially variable within a coral and critical to determining the sensitivity of calcification to ocean acidification.},

abstract = {Measurements of B/Ca ratios in marine carbonates have been suggested to record seawater carbonate chemistry, however experimental calibration of such proxies based on inorganic partitioning remains limited. Here we conducted a series of synthetic aragonite precipitation experiments to evaluate the factors influencing the partitioning of B/Ca between aragonite and seawater. Our results indicate that the B/Ca ratio of synthetic aragonites depends primarily on the relative concentrations of borate and carbonate ions in the solution from which the aragonite precipitates; not on bicarbonate concentration as has been previously suggested. The influence of temperature was not significant over the range investigated (20-40 ??C), however, partitioning may be influenced by saturation state (and/or growth rate). Based on our experimental results, we suggest that aragonite B/Ca ratios can be utilized as a proxy of [CO32-]. Boron isotopic composition (??11B) is an established pH proxy, thus B/Ca and ??11B together allow the full carbonate chemistry of the solution from which the aragonite precipitated to be calculated. To the extent that aragonite precipitation by marine organisms is affected by seawater chemistry, B/Ca may also prove useful in reconstructing seawater chemistry. A simplified boron purification protocol based on amberlite resin and the organic buffer TRIS is also described.},

abstract = {The boron to calcium ratio (B/Ca) in biogenic CaCO3 is being increasingly utilized as a proxy for past ocean carbonate chemistry. However, B/Ca of cultured and core-top foraminifers show dependence on multiple physicochemical seawater properties and only a few of those have been inorganically tested for their impacts. Accordingly, our understanding of the controls on foraminiferal B/Ca and thus how to interpret B/Ca in fossil shells is incomplete. To gain a clearer understanding of the B incorporation mechanism, we performed inorganic calcite precipitation experiments using a pH-stat system. As previously reported, we confirm that B/Ca in calcite increases with both fluid pH and total B concentration (denoted as [BT], where [BT]=[B(OH)3]+[B(OH)4-]). We provide the first evidence that B/Ca also increases with the concentration of total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and calcium ion. With the exception of the [BT] experiments, these chemical manipulations were accompanied by an increase in calcite saturation, and accordingly precipitation rate (denoted as R). But when pH and [Ca2+] were jointly varied at a fixed saturation level to maintain relatively constant R at different pH and [Ca2+] combinations, B/Ca was insensitive to both pH and [Ca2+] changes. These experimental results unequivocally suggest kinetic effects related to R on B/Ca. Furthermore, with a suite of chemical manipulations we found that the B/Ca variability is explicable by just R and the [BT]/[DIC] ratio in the parent fluids. This observation was particularly robust for relatively rapidly precipitated samples, whereas for relatively slowly precipitated samples, it was somewhat ambiguous whether the [BT]/[DIC] or [B(OH)4-]/[HCO3-] ratio provides a better fit to the experimental data. Nonetheless, our experimental results can be considered as indirect evidence for incorporation of both B(OH)4- and B(OH)3 into calcite. We propose a simple mathematical expression to describe the mode of B incorporation into synthetic calcite that depends only on the fluid [BT]/[DIC] ratio and the precipitation rate R. This novel finding has important implications for future calibrations and applications of the B/Ca proxy as well as the $\delta$11B paleo-pH proxy.},

abstract = {When using the boron isotopic composition (??11B) of marine carbonates as a seawater pH proxy, it is assumed that only the tetrahedral borate ion is incorporated into the growing carbonate crystals and that no boron isotope fractionation occurs during uptake. However, the ??11B of the calcium carbonate from most modern foraminifera shells or corals skeletons is not the same as the ??11B of seawater borate, which depends on pH, an observation commonly attributed to vital effects. In this study, we combined previously published high-field 11B MAS NMR and new ??11B measurements on the same synthetic calcite and aragonite samples precipitated inorganically under controlled environments to avoid vital effects. Our results indicate that the main controlling factors of ??11B are the solution pH and the mineralogy of the precipitated carbonate mineral, whereas the aqueous boron concentration of the solution, CaCO3 precipitation rate and the presence or absence of growth seeds all appear to have negligible influence. In aragonite, the NMR data show that boron coordination is tetrahedral (BO4), in addition, its ??11B is equal to that of aqueous borate, thus confirming the paleo-pH hypothesis. In contrast, both trigonal BO3 and tetrahedral BO4 are present in calcite, and its ??11B values are higher than that of aqueous borate and are less sensitive to solution pH variations compared to ??11B in aragonite. These observations are interpreted in calcite as a reflection of the incorporation of decreasing amounts of boric acid with increasing pH. Moreover, the fraction of BO3 measured by NMR in calcite is higher than that inferred from ??11B which indicates a coordination change from BO4 to BO3 upon boron incorporation in the solid. Overall, this study shows that although the observed differences in ??11B between inorganic and biological aragonite are compatible with a pH increase at calcification sites, the B speciation and isotope composition of biological calcites call for a more complex mechanism of boron incorporation.},

@article{Mavromatis2015,
abstract = {About 20years ago, the boron isotopic composition of marine carbonates was proposed as a proxy of ancient seawater pH. Since that time, a large body of studies has used boron isotopes in carbonates to reconstruct seawater paleo-pH and atmospheric paleo-CO2 concentration. To date, however, no systematic investigation of the physicochemical parameters that control boron incorporation in calcite and aragonite (pH, temperature, precipitation rate, etc.) has been performed. To fill this gap, we have experimentally investigated the inorganic co-precipitation of boron with calcite and aragonite at 5 and 25??C in the presence and absence of seed crystals and over the pHNBS range 7.4{\textless}pH{\textless}9.5 in 0.1 or 0.2M NaCl solutions. The boron partition coefficient, DB, between CaCO3 and the fluid is defined as:DB=(XB/XCO3)CaCO3([B]/[CO32-])fluidwith Xi and [i] standing for the mole fraction and molality of the ith species in the solid and fluid, respectively. DB measured in this study are very small (DB???10-3 and ???10-4 for aragonite and calcite, respectively) and exhibit a strong dependence on the solution pH and the calcium carbonate precipitation rate. High field 11B MAS NMR analyses of the precipitated carbonates show that boron in aragonite is mostly in the form of tetragonal B (???85{\%} [IV]B) but that both trigonal and tetragonal B are present in calcite. A significant amount of tetragonal boron in calcite may be in non-lattice (defect) sites, in addition to the structural site. The relative abundance of [III]B and [IV]B in calcite is independent of the parent solution pH but appears to decrease with increasing precipitation rate. The change in boron coordination during its incorporation in calcite and its distribution in, at least, two different sites strongly suggest that the mechanisms controlling B incorporation in this mineral are more complex than for aragonite. It follows that calcite-based calibrations may be less reliable than aragonite calibrations for ocean paleo-pH reconstructions.},
